All orchids form obligate symbiotic relationships with specific fungi for germination and early growth, and the distribution of terrestrial orchid species has been linked to occurrence and abundance of specific orchid mycorrhizal fungi (OMF) in the soil. The availability of OMF can therefore be a habitat requirement that is relevant to consider when establishing management and conservation strategies for threatened orchid species, but knowledge on the spatial distribution of OMF in soil is limited. We here studied the mycorrhizal associations of three terrestrial orchid species (Anacamptis pyramidalis, Orchis purpurea and Platanthera chlorantha) found in a local orchid diversity hotspot in eastern Denmark, and investigated the abundance of the identified mycorrhizal fungi in the surrounding soil. We applied ITS metabarcoding to samples of orchid roots, rhizosphere soil and bulk soil collected at three localities, supplemented with standard barcoding of root samples with OMF specific primers, and detected 22 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) putatively identified as OMF. The three orchid species displayed different patterns of OMF associations, supporting the theory that association with specific fungi constitutes part of an orchid's ecological niche allowing co-occurrence of many species in orchid-rich habitats. The identified mycorrhizal partners in the basidiomycete families Tulasnellaceae and Ceratobasidiaceae (Cantharallales) were detected in low abundance in rhizosphere soil, and appeared almost absent from bulk soil at the localities. This finding highlights our limited knowledge of the ecology and trophic mode of OMF outside orchid tissues, as well as challenges in the detection of specific OMF with standard methods. Potential implications for management and conservation strategies are discussed. All orchids establish obligatory symbiotic relationships with specific fungi for germination and early growth, contributing to ecological niche differentiation. This investigation revealed that three co-occurring terrestrial orchid species engaged with distinct fungal partners. The identified fungi were detected at low abundance in the rhizosphere and appeared nearly absent from bulk soil, raising questions on the ecology and trophic mode of orchid mycorrhizal fungi beyond orchid tissues.image","2024",NA,"10.1002/ece3.10863","WOS:001153233100001"

However, differences in C-14 activities in groundwater samples collected repeatedly from the same wells and discordantly young C-14 groundwater ages compared to noble gases led some authors to question the validity of radiocarbon dating. Poor sampling protocols and storage effects (C-14 contamination) for radiocarbon analysis are a critical factor in explaining age determination discrepancies. We evaluated the impact of storage protocols on carbon isotope exchange with atmospheric carbon dioxide by comparing glass versus standard plastic field sampling bottles for various storage times before radiocarbon and C-13 analyses. The C-14 bias after 12 months in pre-evacuated glass vials was minimal and within analytical precision. However, storage of DIC samples in plastic sampling bottles led to marked changes in C-14 and C-13 contents (up to similar to 15 pmC and similar to 5 parts per thousand, respectively, after 12 months), meaning contamination led to younger groundwater age estimations than it should have been. Protocols for sampling and storing DIC samples for radiocarbon using pre-evacuated glass bottles help avoid atmospheric (CO2)-C-14 contamination and microbial activity.","2024","DEC 2023","10.1080/10256016.2023.2289962","WOS:001124832700001"
"Illarze, G; del Pino, A; Irisarri, P","Differences in Bacterial Communities and Pathogen Indicators of Raw and Lagoon-Stabilized Farm Dairy Effluents","MICROORGANISMS","One practice for handling farm dairy effluent (DE) comprises recycling them to the soil with the challenge of balancing the tradeoff associated with environmental pollution through nutrient and microorganism loading. This study investigated seasonal bacterial community composition, diversity, abundance, and pathogenic indicators in untreated (Raw) and lagoon-stabilized (Lagoon) DE. The correlation between bacterial profiles and DE physicochemical characteristics was also analyzed. Pathogen-indicator bacteria were studied by enumerating viable counts and the bacterial community structure by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Lagoon storage effectively reduced total solids (64%), suspended solids (77%), organic carbon (40%), and total nitrogen (82%), along with total coliforms, Escherichia coli, and enterococci. However, this efficiency was compromised in winter. Lagoon and Raw sample bacterial communities presented different compositions, with several environmental variables correlating to microbial community differences. Lagoon-treated DE exhibited the most diverse bacterial community, dominated by Firmicutes (40%), Proteobacteria (30%), and Bacteroidota (7.6%), whereas raw DE was mainly composed of Firmicutes (76%). Regardless of the season, dominant genera included Trichococcus, Romboutsia, Corynebacterium, and Paeniclostridium. Overall, the study emphasizes the importance of lagoon treatment for DE stabilization, showcasing its role in altering bacterial community composition and mitigating environmental risks associated with pathogens and nutrients, particularly in summer.","2024",NA,"10.3390/microorganisms12020305","WOS:001172237000001"
"Smith, AN; Barton, AD","Effects of dispersal and temperature variability on phytoplankton realized temperature niches","ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","Phytoplankton species exhibit fundamental temperature niches that drive observed species distributions linked to realized temperature niches. A recent analysis of field observations of Prochlorococcus showed that for all ecotypes, the realized niche was, on average, colder and wider than the fundamental niche. Using a simple trait-based metacommunity model that resolves fundamental temperature niches for a range of competing phytoplankton, we ask how dispersal and local temperature variability influence species distributions and diversity, and whether these processes help explain the observed discrepancies between fundamental and realized niches for Prochlorococcus. We find that, independently, both dispersal and temperature variability increase realized temperature niche widths and local diversity. The combined effects result in high diversity and realized temperature niches that are consistently wider than fundamental temperature niches. These results have broad implications for understanding the drivers of phytoplankton biogeography as well as for refining species distribution models used to project how climate change impacts phytoplankton distributions.

A rebound of invasive group A streptococcal (iGAS) infection after COVID-19-associated barrier measures has been observed in children. Several intensivists of French adult ICUs have reported similar bedside impressions without objective data. We aimed to compare the incidence of iGAS infection before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, describe iGAS patients' characteristics, and determine ICU mortality associated factors.Methods We performed a retrospective multicenter cohort study in 37 French ICUs, including all patients admitted for iGAS infections for two periods: two years before period (October 2018 to March 2019 and October 2019 to March 2020) and a one-year after period (October 2022 to March 2023) COVID-19 pandemic. iGAS infection was defined by Group A Streptococcus isolation from a normally sterile site. iGAS infections were identified using the International Classification of Diseases and confirmed with each center's microbiology laboratory databases. The incidence of iGAS infections was expressed in case rate.Results Two hundred and twenty-two patients were admitted to ICU for iGAS infections: 73 before and 149 after COVID-19 pandemic. Their case rate during the period before and after COVID-19 pandemic was 205 and 949/100,000 ICU admissions, respectively (p < 0.001), with more frequent STSS after the COVID-19 pandemic (61% vs. 45%, p = 0.015). iGAS patients (n = 222) had a median SOFA score of 8 (5-13), invasive mechanical ventilation and norepinephrine in 61% and 74% of patients.

Thermocline stratification causes heterogeneous resource distribution, however, the effect of thermocline stratification on phytoplankton dynamic in-depth profiles is still unclear. To understand the underlying mechanism behind the effects of thermocline stratification on phytoplankton species diversity in stratified lakes, the monthly changes in thermocline parameters, deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) parameters, spatial overlap (SO) among major phytoplankton taxonomic groups, and phytoplankton species diversity were evaluated in Lake Qiandaohu in the Zhejiang Province of China from April 2017 to December 2018. Thermocline depth (TD) was significantly negatively related to thermocline strength (TS). The monthly air temperature was the main driver behind the thermocline and the seasonal thermal-stratification cycle was divided into two stratification stages. Significant linear relationships were observed between the DCM parameters (depth, concentration, and thickness) and TD during the strong stratification period. TD was significantly positively related to phytoplankton species diversity and the SO between Cryptophyta and Chlorophyta as well as between Cryptophyta and Bacillariophyta during weak stratification periods. Significant positive correlations were observed between SO and Shannon diversity during both periods. Structural equation modeling (SEM) showed that air temperature significantly decreased TD and increased species diversity by increasing SO during the strong stratification period. Strong stratification under warming favored the formation of shallower and thinner DCMs, leading to phytoplankton coexistence and maintenance of high species diversity through a preclusion of dominance. This study characterized the temporal dynamics of phytoplankton dynamic in-depth profiles in response to strong stratification from warming.","2024","JAN 2024","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169712","WOS:001154448800001"

Both concepts help in understanding how communities are distributed in different habitats and how marine ecosystems respond to environmental change. Here, the study brings a functional approach to the relationship between phytoplankton ecological niches and beta diversity. Phytoplankton community (from pico- to microphytoplankton) was addressed during a spring bloom of Phaeocystis globosa and diatoms, from the eastern English Channel (EEC) toward the southern North Sea (SNS) in 8 distinct water bodies, from late-April 2017 to mid-May 2017. An automated flow cytometer was used to discriminate phytoplankton by their optical properties at the single-cell level from continuous subsurface pumping marine waters, allowing the characterization of 11 phytoplankton functional groups (PFGs) from pico- to microphytoplankton. The spatial segregation of PFGs was performed from total abundance and Local Contribution to Beta Diversity (LCBD) calculations, from the most abundant to the marginal PFGs, through niche's overlap. Nanoeukaryotes (RedNano) associated with Phaeocystis globosa and picophytoplankton associated with Synechococcus spp. (OraPicoProk) were the less marginal PFGs. However, the low niche overlap between these groups revealed they have contrasting habitat affinity. While nanoeukaryotes prefer estuarine habitats or at the vicinity of an estuary, Synechococcus spp. was more likely along the coasts without freshwater influence. Picoeukaryotes with high chlorophyll-a content (RedPico III), coccolithophores (HsNano), and Pseudo-nitzschia-like (RedMicro I) were highly marginal revealing a patchy distribution. Finally, the beta regression predicted changes in community composition (i.e., LCBD values) influenced positively by temperature and the distance to the coast and negatively by salinity. The overall contribution of the PFGs to these changes (i.e., Species Contribution to Beta Diversity) was positively linked to their niche position and negatively related to their environmental tolerance.","2024",NA,"10.1007/s00227-023-04346-6","WOS:001117608300001"

Unraveling the evolution of belowground communities and their feedback mechanisms on SOC dynamics helps embed the ecology of soil microbiome into carbon cycling, which serves to improve biodiversity conservation and carbon management strategy under global change. Here, croplands with a SOC gradient were used to understand how belowground metabolisms and SOC decomposition were linked to the diversity, composition, and co-occurrence networks of belowground communities encompassing archaea, bacteria, fungi, protists, and invertebrates. As SOC decreased, the diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes also decreased, but their network complexity showed contrasting patterns: prokaryotes increased due to intensified niche overlap, while that of eukaryotes decreased possibly because of greater dispersal limitation owing to the breakdown of macroaggregates. Despite the decrease in biodiversity and SOC stocks, the belowground metabolic capacity was enhanced as indicated by increased enzyme activity and decreased enzymatic stoichiometric imbalance. This could, in turn, expedite carbon loss through respiration, particularly in the slow-cycling pool. The enhanced belowground metabolic capacity was dominantly driven by greater multitrophic network complexity and particularly negative (competitive and predator-prey) associations, which fostered the stability of the belowground metacommunity. Interestingly, soil abiotic conditions including pH, aeration, and nutrient stocks, exhibited a less significant role. Overall, this study reveals a greater need for soil C resources across multitrophic levels to maintain metabolic functionality as declining SOC results in biodiversity loss. Our researchers highlight the importance of integrating belowground biological processes into models of SOC turnover, to improve agroecosystem functioning and carbon management in face of intensifying anthropogenic land-use and climate change. A conceptual diagram illustrating that the belowground metacommunity strengthens metabolic capacity in response to decreased resource availability by forming a more complex and competitive multitrophic network. Under SOC decline, the belowground biota are stimulated to generate more multitrophic interactions especially negative associations, with the purpose of more efficiently acquiring carbon and energy. Consequently, despite of the decreases in biodiversity and SOC content, the enhanced enzyme activities and reduced enzymatic stoichiometric imbalance accelerate the carbon loss especially in the slow-cycling pool.image","2024",NA,"10.1111/gcb.17101","WOS:001130387500001"

However, little is known about the patterns of cyanobacterial community variations and changes both on alpha and beta diversity levels in response to eutrophication. Here, we investigated cyanobacterial communities sampled at 140 sites from 59 lakes and reservoirs along a strong eutrophication gradient in eastern China through using CPC-IGS and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We found that taxonomic diversity increased, but phylogenetic diversity decreased significantly along the eutrophication gradient. Both niche width and niche overlap of cyanobacteria significantly decreased from low- to high-nutrient waterbodies. Cyanobacterial community distance-decay relationship became weaker from mesotrophic to hypereutrophic waterbodies, while ecological uniqueness (i.e., local contributions to beta diversity) tended to increase in high-nutrient waterbodies. Latitude and longitude were more important in shaping cyanobacterial community structure than other environmental variables. These findings suggest that eutrophication affects alpha and beta diversity of cyanobacterial communities, leading to increasingly similar community structures in lakes and reservoirs with a higher level of eutrophication. Our work highlights how cyanobacterial communities respond to anthropogenic eutrophication and calls for an urgent need to develop conservation and management strategies to control lake eutrophication and protect freshwater biodiversity.","2024","DEC 2023","10.1016/j.watres.2023.120977","WOS:001143649900001"

Despite their strong negative ecological impact, the existing and prospective distribution patterns of these plant pathogens in China, according to climate change, have received little attention. In this study, we chose three widely dispersed and seriously damaging species, namely, Cytospora chrysosperma, Cytospora mali, and Cytospora nivea, which are the most common species that damage the Juglans regia, Malus domestica, Eucalyptus, Pyrus sinkiangensis, Populus spp., and Salix spp. in China. We utilized ecological niche modeling to forecast their regional distribution in China under four climate change scenarios (present, SSP 126, SSP 370, and SSP 585). The results show that temperature-related climate factors limit the current distribution ranges of the three species. Currently, the three studied species are highly suitable for northeast, northwest, north, and southwest China. Under future climate scenarios, the distribution ranges of the three species are projected to increase, and the centers of the adequate distribution areas of the three species are expected to shift to high-latitude regions. The three species coexist in China, primarily in the northwest and north regions. The ecological niches of C. chrysosperma and C. nivea are more similar. The distribution range of C. mali can reach the warmer and wetter eastern region, whereas C. chrysosperma and C. nivea are primarily found in drought-prone areas with little rainfall. Our findings can help farmers and planners develop methods to avoid the spread of Cytospora spp. and calculate the costs of applying pesticides to reduce contamination and boost yields.","2024",NA,"10.3390/jof10010038","WOS:001151996400001"

During the 2019 commercial shrimp trawl season off coastal Georgia, swabs of skin, gills, cloaca, and gut were taken for three species of batoids (Butterfly Ray, Bluntnose Stingray, and Atlantic Stingray) and one shark species (Atlantic Sharpnose) for high-throughput sequencing of the V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. White muscle was analyzed for stable isotopes (delta 13C and delta 15N) to evaluate potential niche overlap in these four sympatric mesopredators. Significant differences were found in both delta 13C and delta 15N signatures across species, suggesting a degree of resource partitioning. When examined within tissue type, the host species had a weak effect on beta-diversity for cloaca and skin, with no differences found for gill and gut samples. However, network analysis metrics demonstrated a stronger species-specific effect and distinct microbial community relationships were apparent between the shark and batoids, with the former having tighter networks for both internally- and externally-influenced tissues (gut/cloaca and skin/gills, respectively). Despite overlapping habitat use, species' microbiomes differed in their organizational structuring that paralleled differences in stable isotope results, suggesting a mediating role of species-specific ecology on bacterial microbiomes.","2024",NA,"10.3390/fishes9010034","WOS:001149016500001"

Janzen's mountain passes hypothesis proposed that climatic barriers and dispersal limitation shape communities to a greater extent in mountains with lower climatic variability and overlap, permitting higher levels of species coexistence.

We found that climate, climatic variability and spatial distance play dominating roles in affecting microbial beta-diversity patterns and range sizes along elevational gradients.

However, microbial communities experience clear climate-driven limited range sizes and dispersal processes, and show typical endemic patterns, in all mountain ecosystems. Our results emphasize the importance of dispersal and climatic niche processes in shaping montane biodiversity.

We examined the SAR patterns of plants, soil fungi and bacteria among remnant grassland fragments isolated by degraded habitat matrix in a steppe grassland. 3. As expected, we found that the total species richness of plants, fungi and bacteria in the entire fragment decreased with decreasing fragment area. However, the mechanisms differed among taxa. For plants, the lower diversity was most likely because of decreases in habitat quality and habitat heterogeneity on smaller fragments. For fungi, we found similar results, but also an important interaction with plant diversity, suggesting they were coupled via their functional associations. For bacteria, the lower diversity on smaller fragments primarily resulted from a sampling effect from the larger species pool, which outweighed the effect of higher habitat heterogeneity on smaller fragments. 4.

Gut microbes are crucial for understanding avian specie's ecological role and potential impact on the ecosystem. A wide range of factors shape the gut microbial diversity and communities in avian hosts, including similarity in genotype and shared evolutionary history, particularly in two closely related host species than distinctly related hosts. In this study, high-throughput sequencing methods were applied to compare and study the similarities and differences in the gut fungal communities of two geese from the same genus Anser, Greater white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons, WG), Bean goose (Anser fabalis, BG) with Hooded crane (Grus monacha, HC) sympatric in overlapping niches at Shengjin lake, China. Our findings supported our hypothesis that the two closely related geese shared similar gut fungal alpha diversity patterns compared to Hooded cranes due to similarity in genotype and evolutionary history. In particular, the fungal community composition in the gut of Greater white-fronted goose showed larger variation relative to the other two species. This result suggested that dietary preferences might regulate the gut fungal communities, as Hooded crane and Bean goose share parallel dietary preferences. The results of the abundance null deviation model showed higher values of null deviation (NDV) in Greater white-fronted goose and Bean goose, indicating that the two closely related goose species might be associated with more robust gut filtering for their fungal community relative to Hooded crane species. The fungal cooccurrence networks were complex, with higher stability in the two congeneric geese species relative to Hooded crane. Moreover, 29 animal fungal putative pathogens were identified with high diversity and relative abundance in the two congeneric geese due to their complex migration patterns compared with Hooded cranes. However, due to niche overlap, direct or indirect association may lead to the dissemination of gut microbes among sympatric avian species. These findings have important implications for ecological research, conservation efforts, and wildlife health management. Moreover, these findings illuminate potential ecological and conservation repercussions and increase our understanding of the complex interactions between avian species and their gut flora.","2024","DEC 2023","10.1016/j.gecco.2023.e02767","WOS:001138969300001"

Here, we assessed the effects of foliar fungal pathogens on plant growth and species richness using allometric growth theory in population-level and community-level foliar fungal pathogen exclusion experiments. We calculated growth scaling exponents of 24 species to reveal the intraspecific size-dependent effects of foliar fungal pathogens on plant growth. We also calculated the intercepts to infer the growth rates of relatively larger conspecific individuals. We found that foliar fungal pathogens inhibited the growth of small conspecific individuals more than large individuals, resulting in a positive allometric growth. After foliar fungal pathogen exclusion, species-specific growth scaling exponents and intercepts decreased, but became positively related to species' relative abundance, providing a growth advantage for individuals of abundant species with a higher growth scaling exponent and intercept compared with rare species, and thus reduced species diversity. By adopting allometric growth theory, we elucidate the size-dependent mechanisms through which pathogens regulate species diversity and provide a powerful framework to incorporate antagonistic size-dependent processes in understanding species coexistence.","2024","FEB 2024","10.1111/nph.19600","WOS:001170079000001"
"Delory, BM; Callaway, RM; Semchenko, M","A trait-based framework linking the soil metabolome to plant-soil feedbacks","NEW PHYTOLOGIST","By modifying the biotic and abiotic properties of the soil, plants create soil legacies that can affect vegetation dynamics through plant-soil feedbacks (PSF). PSF are generally attributed to reciprocal effects of plants and soil biota, but these interactions can also drive changes in the identity, diversity and abundance of soil metabolites, leading to more or less persistent soil chemical legacies whose role in mediating PSF has rarely been considered. These chemical legacies may interact with microbial or nutrient legacies to affect species coexistence. Given the ecological importance of chemical interactions between plants and other organisms, a better understanding of soil chemical legacies is needed in community ecology. In this Viewpoint, we aim to: highlight the importance of belowground chemical interactions for PSF; define and integrate soil chemical legacies into PSF research by clarifying how the soil metabolome can contribute to PSF; discuss how functional traits can help predict these plant-soil interactions; propose an experimental approach to quantify plant responses to the soil solution metabolome; and describe a testable framework relying on root economics and seed dispersal traits to predict how plant species affect the soil metabolome and how they could respond to soil chemical legacies.","2024","DEC 2023","10.1111/nph.19490","WOS:001128194900001"

Understanding the geographic patterns and drivers of PSF is essential for understanding the mechanisms underlying geographic plant diversity patterns. We compiled a large dataset containing 5969 observations of PSF from 202 studies to demonstrate the global patterns and drivers of PSF for woody and non-woody species. Overall, PSF was negative on average and was influenced by plant attributes and environmental settings. Woody species PSFs did not vary with latitude, but non-woody PSFs were more negative at higher latitudes. PSF was consistently more positive with increasing aridity for both woody and non-woody species, likely due to increased mutualistic microbes relative to soil-borne pathogens. These findings were consistent between field and greenhouse experiments, suggesting that PSF variation can be driven by soil legacies from climates. Our findings call for caution to use PSF as an explanation of the latitudinal diversity gradient and highlight that aridity can influence plant community dynamics and structure across broad scales through mediating plant-soil microbe interactions. Using a large global dataset of plant-soil feedback (PSF) experiments, we did not find a more negative PSF at lower latitudes. Rather, PSF was consistently more positive at drier sites.

However, it remains unclear how changes in PSF due to decline in tree species richness influence the performance of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (EcM) tree species. A PSF experiment was established with eight target tree species (four AM and four EcM tree species) based on a subtropical forest Biodiversity-Ecosystem Functioning Experimental in China (BEF-China) platform, where soil inocula were collected beneath the canopy of target tree species individuals growing in monoculture and eight tree -species mixture plots. We hypothesized that the negative PSF strength of AM tree species would be stronger in monocultures than that in eight treespecies mixtures, resulting in better performance in highly diverse plant communities, whereas EcM tree species would benefit less from tree species richness. However, the results showed consistent PSFs of AM tree species regardless of tree species richness. In contrast, EcM tree species experienced a change from positive in monocultures to negative PSF in eight tree -species mixtures, influencing the performance of EcM tree seedlings. With high concern of the cascading effects of tree species richness on PSFs via modulating soil fungal communities, we revealed that the alterations in EcM fungal abundance, putatively pathogenic fungal diversity, and fungal cooccurrence network complexity mirrored those of PSF associated with EcM tree species, showing the changes from positive in monocultures to negative feedback in eight tree -species mixtures.

Previous studies have focused on the response of root morphological, architectural, and chemical traits to fertilization, while less attention has been given to root biomass and length growth, as well as mycorrhizal symbiosis, impeding a full understanding of root resource acquisition strategies. Here, using a nutrient addition experiment (control, inorganic, and organic nutrients), we explored the responses of function-based root (absorptive fine roots [AFRs] versus transport fine roots [TFRs]) growth, functional traits (morphological, architectural, and chemical traits), and mycorrhizal colonization of C. lanceolat and Q. acutissim, which are the dominant tree species in subtropical China. The results showed that the fine root biomass and total root length of AFRs for both tree species basically decreased significantly after nutrient addition, but TFRs responded less sensitively than AFRs. Nutrient addition significantly increased the mycorrhizal colonization rate in C. lanceolata but decreased it in Q. acutissima. The diameter of AFRs for C. lanceolata increased significantly, while the branch ratio and branch intensity decreased significantly in both inorganic nutrients (NPK) and organic nutrients (F); however, the opposite response pattern occurred for Q. acutissima. Fine root biomass, total root length, and root nutrient concentration exhibited the most plastic responses to changes in nutrient availability. The magnitude of the plastic response of fine root traits was slightly higher in the NPK treatment than in the F treatment. Our findings suggest that the responses of fine root traits and mycorrhizal fungi to nutrient addition were species-specific: C. lanceolata depended on mycorrhizal fungi for resource acquisition, while Q. acutissima could acquire soil nutrient resources by increasing root branching. The contrasting nutrient acquisition strategies between tree species may facilitate plant species coexistence and distribution under soil nutrient change. Fine root biomass and total root length emerged as more pivotal indicators for nutrient acquisition strategies compared to morphological traits.","2024",NA,"10.3390/f15020336","WOS:001175022400001"

However, little is known about how plant-pathogen interactions vary along regional abiotic gradients or with tree species characteristics, which limits our understanding of the causes of variation in tree species richness.We surveyed 10,756 seedlings from 272 tree species for disease symptoms along a mean annual precipitation gradient in the tropical wet forests of Central Panama for 3 months in the early wet season (June-August) and 2 months in the following dry season (March-April). Over 99% of observed disease symptoms were caused by necrotrophic foliar pathogens, while less than 1% of symptoms were attributed to soilborne pathogens. Foliar disease incidence was inversely related to mean annual precipitation, a pattern which may be due to greater disease susceptibility among dry forest species.Foliar disease incidence increased with conspecific seedling density but did not respond to the proximity of conspecific adults. Although foliar disease incidence decreased as mean annual precipitation increased, the strength of conspecific density- or distance-dependence was independent of the precipitation gradient.Seedlings of common tree species and species dispersed by non-flying mammals had a higher risk of foliar pathogen incidence. Increased disease in common species may help reduce their dominance.Synthesis. The increases in foliar pathogen incidence with conspecific seedling density, species abundance, and dispersal mechanism indicate that foliar disease incidence is non-random and may contribute to the regulation of tropical plant communities and species coexistence. Furthermore, the relationships between foliar disease incidence, dispersal mechanism and precipitation suggest plant-pathogen interactions could shift as a response to climate change and disruption of the disperser community.

Aunque la incidencia de enfermedad foliar disminuyo a medida que aumentaba la precipitacion media anual, el efecto de la dependencia de la densidad o la proximidad conspecifico fue independiente de la gradiente de precipitacion.Las plantulas de especies comunes y especies dispersadas por mamiferos no voladores tenian un riesgo mas alto de incidencia de patogenos foliares.

In Dictyota dichotoma, we have previously documented the dominance of fertile sporophytes. In the present study, the phase and sex ratios of sterile thalli of D. dichotoma were determined using newly developed sex-specific markers. Differentially expressed genes were detected by transcriptome analyses of female and male gametophytic strains and a sporophytic strain aiming to identify candidate sex-specific genes. These candidates were aligned with genome sequences on the sex chromosomes of Ectocarpus siliculosus and were identified as putative sex-specific genes of D. dichotoma. Two primer sets were designed to discriminate phase and sex by the presence or absence of PCR products, and these markers were applied to examine the phase and sex ratios of D. dichotoma in various habitats and seasons. The proportion of sporophytes against 33-50 thalli examined in each of the five habitats at Ebisu Island, Shizuoka Prefecture was 88-100%, and the proportion of fertile sporophytes against total sporophytes (fertility proportion) varied among the habitats (0-54%). The fertile sporophytes were remarkably larger than the sterile sporophytes. At Tateyama, Chiba Prefecture, the dominance of sporophytes occurred in all seasons. The fertility proportion of sporophyte was relatively high from February (62.4%) to May (91.9%) and lower than 23% in other seasons. When artificial substrates were anchored in the middle of the D. dichotoma population, newly recruited thalli were all sporophytes, suggesting infrequent reproduction via tetraspores in nature.

Although it is rare for two insular terrestrial carnivores to coexist, these known competitors persist on both Santa Cruz Island and Santa Rosa Island. We hypothesized that examination of their gut microbial communities would provide insight into the factors that enable this coexistence, as microbial symbionts often reflect host evolutionary history and contemporary ecology. Using rectal swabs collected from island foxes and island spotted skunks sampled across both islands, we generated 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data to characterize their gut microbiomes. While island foxes and island spotted skunks both harbored the core mammalian microbiome, host species explained the largest proportion of variation in the dataset. We further identified intraspecific variation between island populations, with greater differentiation observed between more specialist island spotted skunk populations compared to more generalist island fox populations. This pattern may reflect differences in resource utilization following fine-scale niche differentiation. It may further reflect evolutionary differences regarding the timing of intraspecific separation. Considered together, this study contributes to the growing catalog of wildlife microbiome studies, with important implications for understanding how eco-evolutionary processes enable the coexistence of terrestrial carnivores-and their microbiomes-in island environments. We examined the host-associated microbiome of Channel Island foxes and island spotted skunks in the context of fine-scale niche differentiation, as it is rare for two endemic, insular mesocarnivores to coexist.

Yet, plant pathogen-natural enemy interactions might be sensitive to climatic changes. Understanding the relationship between climate, plant pathogens and their natural enemies is thus important for developing climate-resilient, sustainable agriculture.2. To this aim, we recorded shade cover, daily minimum and maximum temperature, relative humidity, coffee leaf rust and its hyperparasite at 58 sites in southwestern Ethiopia during the dry and wet season for 2 years.3. Coffee leaf rust severity was positively related to the maximum temperature. Hyperparasite severity was higher when the minimum temperature was low (i.e. in places with cold night temperatures). While canopy cover did not have a direct effect on rust severity, it reduced rust severity indirectly by lowering the maximum temperature. Canopy cover had a direct positive effect on the hyperparasite severity during one surveying period.4. Synthesis and applications. Our findings highlight that coffee leaf rust and its hyperparasite are both affected by shade cover and temperature, but in different ways. On the one hand, these niche differences lead to the worrying prediction that levels of coffee leaf rust will increase, and its hyperparasite will decrease, with climate change. On the other hand, these niche differences between coffee leaf rust and its hyperparasite provide opportunities to develop strategies to manage the environment (such as shade cover and microclimate) in such a way that the rust is disfavoured and the hyperparasite is favoured.","2024","JAN 2024","10.1111/1365-2664.14578","WOS:001143448800001"

Niche differentiation enabled archaea to coexist with bacteria mainly in a cooperative manner. Bacteria composed of specialists preferred to degrade lighter carbon, while archaea were capable of utilizing heavier carbon. Microbial resource-dependent interactions drove stepwise degradation of organic matter. Bacterial cooperation directly facilitated the degradation of algaedominated particulate organic carbon, while competitive feeding of archaea caused by resource scarcity significantly promoted the mineralization of heavier particulate organic carbon and then the release of dissolved inorganic carbon.

In the subtropical Lake Jinghu, B. fernandoi, B. calyciflorus s.s., and B. dorcas exhibited both seasonal succession and temporal overlap. Seasonal successions were largely attributed to their differential adaptation to temperature, and temporal overlap resulted from their differential responses to algal food concentration. In the tropical Lake Jinniu, B. calyciflorus s.s. persisted throughout the year and overlapped with B. dorcas for 5 months.

Indeed, a previous study revealed that bacterial assemblages at the Cierva Point Wetland Complex (CPWC) are shaped by strong homogeneous selection. Yet which bacterial phylogenetic clades are shaped by selection processes and their ecological strategies to thrive in such extreme conditions remain unknown. Here, we applied the phyloscore and feature-level beta NTI indexes coupled with phylofactorization to successfully detect bacterial monophyletic clades subjected to homogeneous (HoS) and heterogenous (HeS) selection. Remarkably, only the HoS clades showed high relative abundance across all samples and signs of putative microdiversity. The majority of the amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) within each HoS clade clustered into a unique 97% sequence similarity operational taxonomic unit (OTU) and inhabited a specific environment (lotic, lentic or terrestrial). Our findings suggest the existence of microdiversification leading to sub-taxa niche differentiation, with putative distinct ecotypes (consisting of groups of ASVs) adapted to a specific environment. We hypothesize that HoS clades thriving in the CPWC have phylogenetically conserved traits that accelerate their rate of evolution, enabling them to adapt to strong spatio-temporally variable selection pressures. Variable selection appears to operate within clades to cause very rapid microdiversification without losing key traits that lead to high abundance. Variable and homogeneous selection, therefore, operate simultaneously but on different aspects of organismal ecology. The result is an overall signal of homogeneous selection due to rapid within-clade microdiversification caused by variable selection. It is unknown whether other systems experience this dynamic, and we encourage future work evaluating the transferability of our results.","2024","NOV 2023","10.1111/mec.17189","WOS:001096230700001"

In order to better document the dietary habits of Southeast Asian murid and diatomyid rodents, we examined microwear patterns in 21 species, with a particular focus on those living in karst habitats. Five variables of microwear scars (scratches and pits) were counted and measured on the dental facet of the first molar hypocone. We observed large variation and overlap in microwear patterns between and within genera, suggesting that feeding ecology is diverse (mostly generalist omnivorous species) within species and genus. For species living in agro-ecosystems, few differences were observed when we compared sympatric species within a genus, suggesting that niche partitioning is not achieved by feeding, neither in terms of diet composition nor in the way food is processed, or that food items are more homogeneous in terms of physical properties that affect microwear patterns. Differences between sympatric species were more pronounced in forest or karst contexts, suggesting that specialisation and niche differentiation have persisted in more preserved environments. Finally, differences were also observed in urban ecosystems suggesting that the communities of rodents evolved niche partitioning in these human-modified habitats. Our results also revealed differences in microwear patterns between karst and non-karst rodents, with all karst species showing a trend towards increasing numbers of small scratches and small pits. This suggested that the karst environment may influence the dietary habits of rodents, either in terms of the composition of the diet or by altering the general characteristics of the food.","2024","NOV 2023","10.1007/s13364-023-00723-0","WOS:001104070600001"

However, numerous studies have focused on N2O production during the soil tillage period, neglecting the N2O production during the dry fallow period. In this study, we conducted an incubation experiment using the acetylene inhibition technique to investigate N2O emission and reduction rates of paddy soil profiles (0-1 m) from Guangdong Province and Jinlin Province in China, with different heavy-metal pollution levels. The abundance and community structures of denitrifying bacteria were determined via quantitative-PCR and Illumina MiSeq sequencing of nosZ, nirK, and nirS genes. Our results showed that the potential N2O emission rate, N2O production rate, and denitrification rate have decreased with increasing soil vertical depth and heavy-metal pollution. More importantly, we found that the functional gene type of N2O reductase switched with the tillage state of paddy soils, which clade II nosZ genes were the dominant gene during the tillage period, while clade I nosZ genes were the dominant gene during the dry fallow period. The heavy-metal pollution has less effect on the niche differ-entiation of the nosZ gene. The N2O emission rate was significantly regulated by the genus Bradyhizobium, which contains both N2O reductase and nitrite reductase genes. Our findings suggests that the nosZ gene of N2O reductase can significantly impact the N2O emission from paddy soils.

While CMX Nitrospira has been detected in various ecosystems, few studies so far have focused on the relative contribution and co-occurrence network of ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA), bacteria (AOB), and CMX Nitrospira in artificial forest ecosystems (tree plantations). We evaluated the dynamics of composition, co occurrence patterns and contribution of soil microbial nitrifiers to nitrification in soil of various tree species with different ages in the Qilian Mountains employing the space for time substitution approach, quantitative PCR and high-throughput sequencing technology. Generally, plantation development significantly reduced soil potential nitrification rates. Inhibition experiments and modular analysis showed that AOA played leading roles in nitrification of abandoned farmland and 17-year-old Hippophae rhamnoides, whereas CMX Nitrospira dominated in 36-year-old Picea crassifolia, 36-year-old Picea crassifolia and Larix gmelinii mixed plantation, and 50-year-old Picea crassifolia. The dominant AOA and CMX Nitrospira lineages in all samples were Group I.1b and Clade B, respectively. The assembly of nitrifier community was governed by stochastic processes, in which dispersal limitation made a significant contribution. The nitrifiers coexist in a mutualistic manner, albeit with possible functional redundancy, while the modular analysis revealed the aggregation pattern of the four modules in different artificial forests' soil. The Mantel test showed that modular formation is mainly affected by NH4+ and SOM. These results broaden our current understanding of the relation between CMX Nitrospira and canonical ammonia oxidizers in terrestrial ecosystems, and provide empirical evidence for not only niche differentiation, but also the relative contribution and co-occurrence patterns of nitrifying communities in an artificial forest ecosystem.","2024","OCT 2023","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167653","WOS:001099778800001"

However, the prevalence of ARB in the root-associated niches of plants grown in these environments, as well as the distribution patterns of ARB in the rhizosphere and rhizoplane-two critical root-associated niches-remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the prevalence and distribution of ARB in the rhizosphere and rhizoplane of two main plant species, Suaeda salsa and Sporobolus alterniflorus, grown in a pristine environment in Yancheng, China, to address these questions. In total,181 bacterial strains were isolated from the root-associated niches of the two plant species. Strong niche differentiation of the bacterial community between the rhizosphere and rhizoplane was identified by both bacterial isolation- and high-throughput 16S ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) sequencingbased analyses. In total, 69.06 % of the isolated bacterial strains were classified as ARB, with strains resistant to beta-lactam class antibiotics and polymyxin being predominant. The relative abundance of ARB in the rhizoplane was higher than that in the rhizosphere for both plant species. Furthermore, variations were noted in the prevalence and distribution of ARB in the root-associated niches between the two species. Several pathogenic ARBs, such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, were identified among the isolated strains. A representative S. maltophilia strain was sequenced, and several important antibiotic resistance- and pathogenicity-associated genes were identified in its genome.

The first and rate-limiting step in nitrification is ammonia oxidation, which is conducted by both bacteria and archaea. In agriculture, it is important to control this process as high nitrification rates result in NO3- leaching, reduced nitrogen (N) availability for the plants and environmental problems such as eutrophication and greenhouse gas emissions. Nitrification inhibitors can be used to block nitrification, and as such reduce N pollution and improve fertilizer use efficiency (FUE) in agriculture. Currently applied inhibitors target the bacteria, and do not block nitrification by ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA). While it was long believed that nitrification in agroecosystems was primarily driven by bacteria, recent research has unveiled potential significant contributions from ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), especially when bacterial activity is inhibited. Hence, there is also a need for AOA-targeting nitrification inhibitors. However, to date, almost no AOA-targeting inhibitors are described. Furthermore, AOA are difficult to handle, hindering their use to test or identify possible AOA-targeting nitrification inhibitors. To address the need for AOA-targeting nitrification inhibitors, we developed two miniaturized nitrification inhibition assays using an AOA-enriched nitrifying community or the AOA Nitrosospaera viennensis. These assays enable high-throughput testing of candidate AOA inhibitors. We here present detailed guidelines on the protocols and illustrate their use with some examples. We believe that these assays can contribute to the discovery of future AOA-targeting nitrification inhibitors, which could complement the currently applied inhibitors to increase nitrification inhibition efficiency in the field and as such contribute to a more sustainable agriculture.","2024",NA,"10.3389/fpls.2023.1283047","WOS:001154914700001"

In this study, we recovered metagenome-assembled genomes of 27 endogenous nimaviruses from crustacean genome data. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four major lineages within Nimaviridae, and for three of these lineages, we propose novel genera of endogenous nimaviruses: Majanivirus and Pemonivirus identified from penaeid shrimp genomes, and Clopovirus identified from terrestrial isopods. Majanivirus genomes contain multiple eukaryotic-like genes such as baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat-containing genes, innexins, and heat shock protein 70-like genes, some of which contain introns. An alignment of long reads revealed that each endogenous nimavirus species specifically inserts into host microsatellites or within 28S rDNA. This insertion preference was associated with the type of virus-encoded DNA recombination enzymes, the integrases. Majaniviruses, pemoniviruses, some whispoviruses, and possibly clopoviruses specifically insert into the arthropod telomere repeat motif (TAACC/GGTTA)n and all possessed a specific tyrosine recombinase family. Pasiphaea japonica whispovirus and Portunus trituberculatus whispovirus, the closest relatives of white spot syndrome virus, integrate into the host 28S rDNA and are equipped with members of another family of tyrosine recombinases that are distantly related to telomere-specific tyrosine recombinases. Endogenous nimavirus genomes identified from sesarmid crabs, which lack tyrosine recombinases and are flanked by a 46-bp inverted terminal repeat, integrate into (AT/TA)n microsatellites through the acquisition of a Ginger2-like cut-and-paste DDE transposase. These results suggest that endogenous nimaviruses are giant transposable elements that occupy different sequence niches through the acquisition of different integrase families.","2024","DEC 2023","10.1128/spectrum.00559-23","WOS:001117637800001"

For mycorrhizal fungi, mutualistic niche construction has been proposed where partners construct niches for each other. However, few eco-evolutionary mechanisms leading to mutualistic symbiotic feedback have been described. Here we report niche construction by two ectomycorrhiza-forming species of truffles, Tuber aestivum and T. melanosporum. The soils of 263 spots of these Tuber, which create bare patches (brule ' s), have been monitored (9-10 years) in natural forests to analyze whether they meet the criteria to satisfy the mutualistic niche construction process. Soil habitat modification by these Tuber can be seen in their brule ' s, where the vegetation of arbuscular mycorrhizal plants and soil organisms are largely suppressed. Tuber melanosporum brule ' s were smaller more productive, and with lower vegetation cover than T. aestivum. Interactions among soil carbonates, pH, and brule ' size are associated with increased carpophore productivity, indicating positive feedback between habitat modification and fungal fitness. Both species modified the habitat differentially. Tuber aestivum brule ' s had higher pH and lower total carbonate than soils outside. Tuber melanosporum brule ' s had lower total carbonate and higher exchangeable Ca2+ and active carbonate than soils outside.

Yet, it is unclear how their sex-specific nutrient acquisition strategy affects the contributions of inorganic and organic phosphorus (P) soil pools to plant-available P. Here, the contribution of inorganic and organic P sources to available P in soil and sex-specific P acquisition during the whole growing season (from June to October) was assessed in a 20-year-old Populus euphratica plantation via analysing the transformation of soil P pools. Poplar females obtain available inorganic P by increasing specific root length (by 71% compared with males) and releasing organic acids to mobilise P from precipitated P (HCl-P), thus obtaining higher P than males during the mid-growing season (June). The increased mobilisation of moderately precipitated P in the rhizosphere was more significant in females during the whole growing season. During the late-growing season, males showed increased alkaline phosphatase activities (by 25% compared with females) and maintained a higher abundance of arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi to obtain P via higher consumption of organic and residual P (decreased by 68% and 24% from June to October). These changes in P acquisition strategies reflect the temporal niche differentiation: females acquire inorganic P mainly during the beginning and middle of the season, whereas males take up organic P and HCl-P, preferably in the second half of the season. The strategic adjustment of sex-specific P acquisition modulated the transformation of organic and inorganic P sources in soil towards plant-available P, increasing resource niche partitioning between two poplar sexes to maintain P supply.","2024","FEB 2024","10.1007/s00374-024-01799-9","WOS:001163799200001"

In this study, sediment samples were collected from various areas of Taihu Lake with different trophic conditions in all four seasons from 2015 to 2017. Using high-throughput sequencing and molecular ecological network analysis, we investigated the microbial interaction patterns and the role of nitrogen cycling in sediments from lakes with different trophic conditions. The results showed distinct structures of sediment microbial networks between lake areas with different trophic conditions. In the more eutrophic region, network indices indicate higher transfer efficiency of energy, material, and information, more significant competition, and weaker niche differentiation of the microbial community. The sedimentary environment in the moderately eutrophic area exhibited greater potential for denitrification, nitrification, and anammox compared to the mesotrophic area, but the inhibition between N functional microbes and limitations in N removal processes were also more likely to occur. The topological structure of the networks showed that the carbon (C), sulfur (S), and iron (Fe) cycles had a strong influence on the nitrogen cycle in both lake areas. In the moderately eutrophic lake area, C-and S-cycling functional bacteria facilitated a closed cycle of the coupled N fixation-nitrification-DNRA (dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium) process and reduced N removal. In the mesotrophic lake area, C and S-cycling functional bacteria promoted both N fixation and mineralization, and Fe-cycling functional bacteria coupled with denitrifiers enhanced the nitrogen removal process of products from nitrogen fixation and mineralization.

LocationGlobal. Time period2000-2021. Major taxa studiedArchaea, bacteria. MethodsWe synthesized 8322 paired observations of soil microorganisms related to N cycling from field experiments in which GCFs (climate change and nutrient addition) were manipulated. ResultsWe found that the abundance of soil microbes and most N-cycling genes were resistant to elevated CO2, experimental warming and water addition/reduction; however, N addition and the combination of N addition with other GCFs significantly increased the abundance of ammonia oxidizer bacteria (amoA-AOB). The results indicated that in steady-state (natural) conditions, the main factors driving the global abundance of soil bacteria, archaea and N-cycling genes varied in terms of the contributions of climatic and edaphic factors. However, upon manipulation of GCFs, the induced change in soil pH was the most essential factor associated with changes in the abundance of soil microbes and N-cycling genes.

Soil samples were collected seasonally along with plant succession across a spatial gradient of vegetation coverage in the first year and also from densely vegetated areas in the growing season of the fourth year. The vegetation expansion rapidly modified landscape appearance of the tidal flats, leading to remarkable temporal increases in plant productivity (indicated by height and density) and soil organic matter (SOM) contents in the first year. The growing season plant productivity and SOM further increased after 3 years of vegetation development. Bacterial taxonomic diversities (based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing) did not change in spring and summer but greatly increased in autumn when plant productivity peaked and plant debris was partly released to soil; thereafter, the diversity remained at high levels and did not increase much in the following 3 years. In addition, microbial taxonomic diversities, and the modularity and complexity of microbial co-occurrence networks, increased from bare flats, sparsely vegetated areas, to densely revegetated areas. These results supported a positive but saturating relationship between microbial diversity and wetland plant productivity. The increasing taxonomic diversity was associated with higher number of rare microbes (i.e., those at abundances < 0.1%) at larger productivity. Also, soil with higher microbial taxonomic diversities had more degradable carbon sources and greater microbial functional diversity in Biolog EcoPlate analysis. Microbial functional prediction suggested more diversified metabolic types and enhanced levels of critical wetland functions including methanotrophy, sulfate respiration, and fermentation at higher plant productivity. To conclude, plant productivity showed positive impacts on microbial taxonomic and functional diversities at the initial stages of wetland vegetation succession, presumably because higher productivity supported more rare species and promoted microbial niche differentiation.","2023",NA,"10.1007/s12237-023-01180-3","WOS:001157852900015"

Terrestrial ecosystems provide multiple ecosystem services simultaneously, such as carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling, water purification, and biodiversity conservation, known as ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF). However, the mechanisms by which biotic and abiotic factors, and their interactions regulate EMF in grasslands are unclear. We conducted a transect survey to illustrate the single and combined effects of biotic factors (including plant species diversity, trait-based functional diversity, community-weighted mean (CWM) of traits, and soil microbial diversity) and abiotic factors (including climate and soil) on EMF. Eight functions were investigated, including aboveground living biomass and litter biomass, soil bacterial biomass, fungal biomass, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi biomass, and soil organic carbon storage, total carbon storage and total nitrogen storage. We detected a significant interactive effect between plant species diversity and soil microbial diversity on the EMF; Structural equation model showed that soil microbial diversity indirectly affected EMF by regulating plant species diversity. These findings highlight the importance of the interaction effect of aboveand below-ground diversity on EMF. Both plant species diversity and functional diversity had similar explanatory power for the variation in EMF, implying that niche differentiation and multifunctional complementarity among plant species and traits are essential in regulating the EMF. Furthermore, the effects of abiotic factors on EMF were stronger than those of biotic factors via direct and indirect pathways affecting above- and below-ground biodiversity. As a dominant regulator, the soil sand content was negatively correlated with EMF. These findings indicate the vital role of abiotic mechanisms in affecting EMF, and deepen our understanding of the single and combined effects of biotic and abiotic factors on EMF.

Such assemblages are often connected through various ecological processes, such as dispersal, and may be more accurately assessed as components of regional-, rather than local-scale assemblages. With recent declines in the costs of sequencing and computation, it has also become increasingly feasible to use metabarcoding to more accurately classify algal species and perform regional-scale bioassessments. Recently, zeta diversity has been explored as a novel method of constructing regional bioassessments for groups of streams. Here, we model the use of zeta diversity to investigate whether stream health can be determined by the landscape diversity of algal assemblages. We also compare the use of DNA metabarcoding and morphotaxonomy classifications in these zeta diversity-based bioassessments of regional stream health. From 96 stream samples in California, we used various orders of zeta diversity to construct models of biotic integrity for multiple assemblages of diatoms, as well as hybrid assemblages of diatoms in combination with soft-bodied algae, using taxonomy data generated with both DNA sequencing as well as traditional morphotaxonomic approaches. We compared our ability to evaluate the ecological health of streams with the performance of multiple algal indices of biological condition. Our zeta diversity-based models of regional biotic integrity were more strongly correlated with existing indices for algal assemblages classified using metabarcoding compared to morphotaxonomy. Metabarcoding for diatoms and hybrid algal assemblages involved rbcL and 18S V9 primers, respectively. Importantly, we also found that these algal assemblages, independent of the classification method, are more likely to be assembled under a process of niche differentiation rather than stochastically. Taken together, these results suggest the potential for zeta diversity patterns of algal assemblages classified using metabarcoding to inform stream bioassessments.","2023","FEB 2023","10.1002/eap.2812","WOS:000935976000001"

Little is known of the role of such emergent processes in the restoration of damaged ecosystems. Here, we test for evidence of a BPR in degraded freshwater lakes, and its role in underpinning or undermining lake recovery from eutrophic states. Location: Lower Yangtze and Huaihe river basins, China, East Asia. Taxa: Freshwater phytoplankton; also macrophytes, fish, zooplankton and zoobenthos. Methods: A systematic review of biodiversity studies was conducted to enumerate freshwater biodiversity change during eutrophication, encompassing 572 samples from 155 lakes in East China. Empirical samples were then taken of 93 phytoplankton communities from 38 lakes in ecologically degraded states of eutrophication. Samples were analysed for niche overlap in relation to biodiversity and productivity, and metrics of network structure indicative of community stability. Results: Reviewed publications on eutrophication in East China lakes revealed losses in biodiversity of macrophytes, fishes, zooplankton and zoobenthos but not phytoplankton. Empirically sampled eutrophic lakes maintained high phytoplankton biodiversity through niche differentiation, and phytoplankton biodiversity correlated positively with biomass, in line with the expectations of BPR. Conclusions: The positive effect of biodiversity on phytoplankton productivity in eutrophic lakes acts in opposition to the negative impacts on productivity induced by eutrophication-management strategies of nutrient suppression. In degraded systems, the BPR contributes to sustaining productivity of lake phytoplankton communities, impeding recovery from a eutrophic state. This is a case of the BPR playing an undesirable role at the ecosystem level.

Mortality causes are still not well understood, but falling from the host tree has been suggested as a leading cause of epiphyte mortality and community dynamics. Little empirical evidence exists for why epiphytes do not survive when forced to become terrestrial, and few studies exist that transplant epiphytes between high- and low-forest strata to test trade-offs between thriving in canopy environments and survival in the forest understorey.Here, we experimentally test two hypotheses regarding the drivers of epiphyte mortality in a cloud forest of central Panama. We test whether simple contact with terrestrial soil is deleterious to epiphytes, preliminarily testing the epiphyte enemy escape hypothesis, and test the vertical niche differentiation hypothesis, wherein epiphytes are specifically adapted for microsites throughout the vertical forest strata. By monitoring survival, leaf loss and health status of 270 transplanted epiphytes for a year and a half, we pinpoint the extent to which soil contact and height of origin regulate epiphyte performance.We found that contact with terrestrial soil itself was detrimental to epiphytes in situ, providing some of the first empirical data to explain why falling onto the ground, versus falling into the understorey, is particularly fatal to epiphytes. However, we also found that mortality rates vary substantially among taxonomic groups and among epiphytes that originally came from different height strata.Synthesis. Plants that are adapted for the canopy experience a trade-off with higher mortality when in contact with terrestrial soil. Follow-up studies should explore the role of terrestrial soil microbes and physiological constraints as potential drivers of decreased grounded epiphyte survival.","2023","SEP 2023","10.1111/1365-2745.14187","WOS:001061622000001"

Based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, the metataxonomic results indicated that though these communities share identical habitat, the FAB community possesses a higher bacterial richness and noticeably distinct community composition than its PFLB counterpart. The Alphaproteobacteria (mostly Rhodobacteraceae) preponderated in the FAB community, while Bacteroidetes (primarily Flavobacteriaceae) dominated the PFLB. By analyzing co-occurrence pattern, we portrayed a complex ecological network, strong inter-species interactions, and diverse keystone taxa in the FAB community. Intriguingly, Halieaceae and Rhodobacteraceae members were recognized as prominent keystone taxa in FAB and PFLB communities, respectively, highlighting their regulatory roles in sustaining stability of these communities. Furthermore, negative edges proportion varied considerably in ecological networks, suggesting that both communities experience distinct niche differentiation. PICRUSt2-based prediction demonstrated that functional pathways pertaining to membrane transporters, cell motility, and polymer degradation were enriched in the FAB community, suggesting their involvement in surface-adapted lifestyles. Altogether, we proved that attached and planktonic bacterial communities serve as two distinct microbial consortia, perform different tasks, and hence could have diverse ecological roles in biofloc aquaculture systems. Our findings advance scientific understanding of microbiota variations between planktonic and attached communities in aquatic environments, and strengthen the proposed species sorting hypothesis, which states that prevailing environmental factors determine bacterial community assembly.","2023","AUG 2023","10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.739946","WOS:001051293500001"

To optimize an integrated aquaculture and agriculture (IAA) system and ensure sustainable utilization and development of land resources, an IAA system combining rice cultivation with red claw crayfish culture was implemented to assess the impacts of rice-red claw crayfish co-culturing on the dynamics and assembly of bacterial communities in paddy soils. We established two experimental groups, each with eight replicates. We utilized 16S rRNA Illumina high-throughput sequencing to access the bacterial community composition and assembly in paddy soils. Red claw crayfish C. quadricarinatus cultivation did not significantly affect the alpha diversity of the bacterial community in the paddy field, but it obviously increased the relative abundances of the phyla Acidobacteriota and Pseudomonadota involved in organic matter degradation and nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon cycling. Red claw crayfish cultivation could lead to more complex bacterial communities, increased bacterial resistance to disturbances, the promotion of niche differentiation, and increased competition intensity between bacterial communities during the mid-cultivation period. Nitrogen emerged as a critical factor influencing the bacterial community composition in paddy soil during the culture period, and the red claw crayfish cultivation affected the bacterial community by altering the ammonia concentration in the paddy soil. As the culture progressed, the assembly of the bacterial community in the paddy soil was predominantly driven by stochastic processes, and red claw crayfish cultivation accelerated the evolution of the bacterial community assembly towards a stochastic process. Our study offers valuable insights into the dynamic changes occurring in the composition and assembly of bacterial communities in paddy soils in response to red claw crayfish cultivation.","2023",NA,"10.3390/environments10100178","WOS:001094364300001"

However, few evaluations have been performed on the changes in the community structure and abun-dance of soil ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) under substituting portion of chemical fertilizers with organic manure (organic substitution) and their relative contribution to the ammonia oxida-tion process. Here, five long-term fertilization strategies were applied in field (SN: synthetic fertilizer application; OM: organic manure; M1N1: substituting 50 % of chemical N fertilizer with organic manure; M1N4: substituting 20 % of chemical N fertilizer with organic manure; and CK: no fertilizer). We investigated the response characteristics of AOB and AOA community structures by selective inhibitor shaking assays and high-throughput sequencing and further explained their relative contribution to the ammonia oxidation process during three consecutive years of vegetable production. Compared to SN and M1N4, the potential of ammonia oxidation (PAO) was significantly reduced by 26.4 % and 22.3 % in OM and 9.5 % and 4.4 % in M1N1, resulting in N2O reductions of 38.9 % and 30.8 % (OM) and 31.2 % and 21.1 % (M1N1), respectively, and NO reductions of 45.0 % and 34.1 % (OM) and 40.1 % and 28.3 % (M1N1). RDA and correlation analyses showed that the soil organic carbon and ammonium nitrogen content increased while AOB gene abundance and diversity significantly decreased with increasing organic replacement ratio; however, the relative abundance of Nitrosomonas in AOB increased in OM and M1N1, which further demonstrates that AOB are the main driver in vegetable soils. Therefore, the appropriate proportion of organic substitution (OM and M1N1) could decrease the N2O and NO emissions contributed by AOB by affecting the soil physicochemical properties and AOB community structure.","2023","JAN 2023","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.161231","WOS:000919137300001"

Soil samples were collected seasonally along with plant succession across a spatial gradient of vegetation coverage in the first year and also from densely vegetated areas in the growing season of the fourth year. The vegetation expansion rapidly modified landscape appearance of the tidal flats, leading to remarkable temporal increases in plant productivity (indicated by height and density) and soil organic matter (SOM) contents in the first year. The growing season plant productivity and SOM further increased after 3 years of vegetation development. Bacterial taxonomic diversities (based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing) did not change in spring and summer but greatly increased in autumn when plant productivity peaked and plant debris was partly released to soil; thereafter, the diversity remained at high levels and did not increase much in the following 3 years. In addition, microbial taxonomic diversities, and the modularity and complexity of microbial co-occurrence networks, increased from bare flats, sparsely vegetated areas, to densely revegetated areas. These results supported a positive but saturating relationship between microbial diversity and wetland plant productivity. The increasing taxonomic diversity was associated with higher number of rare microbes (i.e., those at abundances < 0.1%) at larger productivity. Also, soil with higher microbial taxonomic diversities had more degradable carbon sources and greater microbial functional diversity in Biolog EcoPlate analysis. Microbial functional prediction suggested more diversified metabolic types and enhanced levels of critical wetland functions including methanotrophy, sulfate respiration, and fermentation at higher plant productivity. To conclude, plant productivity showed positive impacts on microbial taxonomic and functional diversities at the initial stages of wetland vegetation succession, presumably because higher productivity supported more rare species and promoted microbial niche differentiation.","2023","FEB 2023","10.1007/s12237-023-01180-3","WOS:000924703300001"

We examined the biogeo-graphic patterns and relative influences of different assembly processes in structuring the abundant and rare bacterioplankton sub-communities of Chilika, the largest brackish water coastal lagoon of India. Rare taxa demonstrated significantly higher alpha-and f3-diversity and biogeochemical functions than abundant taxa in the high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequence dataset. The majority of the abundant taxa (91.4 %) were habitat generalists with a wider niche breadth (niche breadth index, B = 11.5), whereas most of the rare taxa (95.2 %) were habitat specialists with a narrow niche breadth (B = 8.9). Abundant taxa exhibited a stronger distance-decay relationship and higher spatial turnover rate than rare taxa. f3-diversity partitioning revealed that the contribution of species turnover (72.2-97 .8 %) was greater than nestedness (2.2-27 .8 %) in causing the spatial variation in both abundant and rare taxa. Null model analyses revealed that the distribu-tion of abundant taxa was mostly structured by stochastic processes (62.8 %), whereas deterministic pro-cesses (54.1 %) played a greater role in the rare taxa. However, the balance of these two processes varied across spatio-temporal scales in the lagoon. Salinity was the key deterministic factor controlling the variation of both abundant and rare taxa. Potential interaction networks showed a higher influence of negative interac-tions, indicating that species exclusion and top-down processes played a greater role in the community as sem -bly. Notably, abundant taxa emerged as keystone taxa across spatio-temporal scales, suggesting their greater influences on other bacterial co-occurrences and network stability. Overall, this study provided detailed mechanistic insights into biogeographic patterns and underlying community assembly processes of the abun-dant and rare bacterioplankton over spatio-temporal scales in a brackish lagoon.","2023","APR 2023","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163109","WOS:000976298500001"

Under trait convergence, similar responses may cause distantly related taxa to exhibit spatially correlated functional diversity. We investigated whether similar responses of reef fish, coral and algal functional richness and disparity to the environment produce spatially correlated functional diversity patterns. Location: Brazilian marine biogeographical province. Taxon: Reef fish, corals, algae. Methods: We analysed data from 40 coastal and oceanic sites distributed across 27 degrees of latitude in the Brazilian province. Using traits, we measured functional richness (FRic) and disparity (Rao's Q) and calculated Pearson's correlation (rho(obs)) between pairs of metrics and taxa. We used Bayesian multivariate linear models to model taxa functional richness and disparity relative to sea surface temperature (SST), turbidity, salinity, species richness and region, and to estimate the residual correlation (rho(res)) between metrics after accounting for these variables. Results: The best fitted model contained SST, species richness and region, and explained about 56% of the variation in FRic and Rao's Q across taxa. Yet, FRic and Rao's Q of fish, algae and corals responded differently to environmental variables. Functional diversity metrics were less correlated between algae and corals than compared to fish. Observed correlations of FRic and Rao's Q were low to intermediate across taxa (average rho(obs) = 0.14), and residual correlations were even lower (average rho(res) = 0.02). Main conclusions: SST, species richness and region had a widespread role in determining spatially congruent functional diversity offish, algae and corals across Brazilian reefs, despite their fundamentally different evolutionary histories. Low residual spatial correlations suggest that other mechanisms might also contribute to functional diversity patterns of reef taxa independently. Given the role of SST, species richness and region, the functional structure of these reefs might be compromised by climate change, pollution and overfishing.","2023","MAR 2023","10.1111/jbi.14599","WOS:000960959700001"

However, the characteristics of rhizosphere potential nitrification rate (PNR), ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) population under manure combined biochar are unclear. In this study, a pot experiment growing lemon was conducted, setting up six treatments, namely no fertilization (CK), chemical fertilizer (CF), manure (M), chemical fertilizer combined with biochar (CFBC), manure combined with biochar (MBC), fresh manure combined with biochar (FMBC). We investigated the effects of manure, chemical fertilizer and manure combined with biochar on soil physical-chemical properties, PNR, and the amoA gene abundance, diversity and structure of AOA and AOB in the rhizosphere. Our results showed that compared with CK treatment, CF and CFBC increases PNR by 19.3-34.7 % in the rhizosphere, M, MBC and FMBC decrease PNR about 60.0 %; CF and CFBC increased AOA amoA gene copies by 40.2-101.7 %, while M, MBC and FMBC treatments decreased it by 66.5-81.9 %, five fertilization treatments decreased the AOB amoA gene copy by 33.1-81.9 %. The redundancy analysis showed that chemical fertilizer and manure combined with biochar affects the population structure of AOA and AOB by pH, available phosphorus (AP), ratio of carbon to nitrogen (C/N), soil moisture content (SMC), nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) in the rhizosphere. The results of partial least squares indicated that pH, total nitrogen (TN), AOA amoA gene copy and AOA Shannon index were main factors affecting nitrification potential in the rhizosphere. Therefore, AOA dominates the ammonia oxidation process in the acid purple soil under the condition of chemical fertilizer and pig manure combined with rice husk biochar. Meanwhile, fertilization affected ammonia oxidation process by regulating soil pH and TN in lemon rhizosphere soil.","2023","SEP 2022","10.1016/j.apsoil.2022.104660","WOS:000888754600005"

However, the biotic and abiotic mechanisms that drive C, N, P, and S cycling following manure application are not completely understood. In this study, soil samples were collected from long-term experimental plots that had been amended with farmyard manure or mineral fertilisers since 1964. Isotope labelling with 15N, 33P, and 35S; metagenomics; and high-throughput sequencing were used to reveal the re-lationships between C, N, P, and S dynamics and microbial community composition and functions depending on fertilisation. A clear niche differentiation was observed between bacteria and fungi under mineral and manure regimes. A network analysis showed that long-term manure application reduced the complexity and stability of soil microbial network. Furthermore, a variation partitioning analysis based on redundancy analysis indicated that microbial community variation was mainly driven by soil Cand N contents. Dissolved organic C was the most important factor regulating microbial community structure. Soil C and N contents explained 43.5% of bacterial and 37.9% of fungal community variations. In contrast, soil P and S contents explained 29.9% of bacterial and 20.3% of fungal community variations. Long-term manure application increased the abundance of most func-tional genes related to C, N, P, and S cycling. This led to increased C and N cycling rates under manure appli-cation, which provided sufficient substrates for microbial growth. Partial least squares path modelling indicated that soil physicochemical properties, especially dissolved organic carbon, directly influenced C and S cycling, whereas the N and P cycles were indirectly affected by the changes in microbial community composition. These results provide a new perspective on both direct and indirect effects of organic manure and inorganic fertilisers on the soil nutrient cycling processes mediated by soil microbial community.","2023","MAR 2023","10.1016/j.soilbio.2023.109019","WOS:000974260900001"

Salinity is a factor that affects the distribution of microorganisms in estuarine and coastal environments. Cluster 5 Synechococcus is one of the most important primary producers on earth. However, ecotypes of this genus exhibit complex geographical distributions, and the genetic basis of niche partitioning is still not fully understood. Here, we report distinct distributions of subcluster 5.1 (SC5.1) and subcluster 5.2 (SC5.2) Synechococcus in estuarine waters, and we reveal that salinity is the main factor determining their distribution. Clade III (belonging to SC5.1) and CB4 (belonging to SC5.2) are dominant clades in the study region, with different ecological distributions. We further conducted physiological, genomic, and transcriptomic studies of Synechococcus strains YX04-3 and HK05, which are affiliated with clade III and CB4, respectively. Laboratory tests showed that HK05 could grow at low salinity (13 ppt), whereas the growth of YX04-3 was suppressed when salinity decreased to 13 ppt. Genomic and transcriptomic analysis suggested that euryhaline clade CB4 is capable of dealing with a sudden drop of salinity by releasing compatible solutes through mechanosensitive channels that are coded by the mscL gene, decreasing biosynthesis of organic osmolytes, and increasing expression of heat shock proteins and high light-inducible proteins to protect photosystem. Furthermore, CB4 strain HK05 exhibited a higher growth rate when growing at low salinity than at high salinity. This is likely achieved by reducing its biosynthesis of organic osmolyte activity and increasing its photosynthetic activity at low salinity, which allowed it to enhance the assimilation of inorganic carbon and nitrogen. Together, these results provide new insights regarding the ecological distribution of SC5.2 and SC5.1 ecotypes and their underlying molecular mechanisms.IMPORTANCE Synechococcus is a group of unicellular Cyanobacteria that are widely distributed in global aquatic ecosystems.

The denitrification rate reached maximum values of 0.438 and 0.446 kg m-3 d-1 in reactor I (salinity 0 parts per thousand) and reactor II (salinity 20 parts per thousand), respectively. Although ammonia was formed in both systems based on dissimilation nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA), the concentration was very low (2.47 +/- 1.99 and 2.84 +/- 1.79 mg L-1); moreover, the nitrite content was average (1.01 +/- 0.87 and 0.96 +/- 0.86 mg L-1).

Here we evaluated the resource availability, relative contributions of autochthonous and allochthonous carbon sources (by Bayesian mixing models) and trophic structure (using delta 13C and delta 15N) of Lake Poyang, the largest freshwater lake in China, during different hydrological periods. Terrestrial C3 plants in the aquatic/terrestrial transition zones (ATTZ) were the main supporter of aquatic consumers all year round. Compared with historical data, the contributions of autochthonous production to aquatic food webs were low. This is primarily ascribed to the influences of hydrological regimes in that the operation of Three Gorges Dam and HC changed the rhythm of WLF in Lake Poyang, restricting the production of aquatic vegetation and epiphytic algae. Most common fish species indicated higher trophic positions (TPs) during the dry than wet season, but only eleven of thirty-six common species showed a statistically significant increase (p < 0.05). Our study reveals a relatively consistent trophic diversity of consumer communities (fish and aquatic invertebrates) during dry and wet seasons, but each trophic guild showed specific trophic response to WLF, as they flexibly adjusted feeding strategies and the degree of trophic niche differentiation. Although WLF triggered fluctuations in the resource availability and species composition of lake food webs, and the TPs and trophic niches of aquatic consumers during different hydrological periods, the resource diversity and habitat complexity driven by HC and WLF reduced the strength of trophic interactions, and thus resulted in overall stability of food web trophodynamics and trophic structure of Lake Poyang.

In this study, the effects of different types of tillage [no-till (NT) and conventional mouldboard tillage (CT)] in combination with four fertilisation regimes [unfertilised control (CON), mineral NPK (MIN), organic (compost) (ORG), and mixed (NPK + compost) (MIX)] on SOC and microbial biomass (Cmic) were examined two decades after the experiment was initiated.

SOC content was significantly higher in NT than in CT at 0-10 cm depth, with an average difference of 0.6-1.3 % SOC, depending on fertilisation. Organic fertilisation increased the SOC content in both tillage systems up to a depth of 20 cm. Microbial biomass, abundance of total bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA, and fungal ITS genes decreased with depth, corresponding to the decrease in SOC, and, consequently, were higher in NT than in CT, in the top 20 cm soil for microbial biomass and bacterial abundance and top 10 cm for fungi and archaea.

Due to the lack of representatives, however, their ecological roles and adaptation to extreme habitats such as AMD as well as how they diverge across the lineage remain largely unexplored. By applying genome-resolved metagenomics, 28 Parvarchaeales-associated metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) representing two orders and five genera were recovered. Among them, we identified three new genera and proposed the names Candidatus Jingweiarchaeum, Candidatus Haiyanarchaeum, and Candidatus Rehaiarchaeum, with the former two belonging to a new order, Candidatus Jingweiarchaeales. Further analyses of the metabolic potentials revealed substantial niche differentiation between Jingweiarchaeales and Parvarchaeales. Jingweiarchaeales may rely on fermentation, salvage pathways, partial glycolysis, and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) for energy conservation reservation, while the metabolic potentials of Parvarchaeales might be more versatile. Comparative genomic analyses suggested that Jingweiarchaeales favor habitats with higher temperatures and that Parvarchaeales are better adapted to acidic environments. We further revealed that the thermal adaptation of these lineages, especially Haiyanarchaeum, might rely on genomic features such as the usage of specific amino acids, genome streamlining, and hyperthermophile featured genes such as rgy. Notably, the adaptation of Parvarchaeales to acidic environments was possibly driven by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). The reconstruction of ancestral states demonstrated that both may have originated from thermal and neutral environments and later spread to mesothermal and acidic environments.

Jingweiarchaeales, and in-depth comparative genomic analysis, we unveiled the functional differentiation of these lineages. Furthermore, we show that the adaptation of these lineages to high-temperature and acidic environments was driven by different strategies, with the former relying more on genomic characteristics such as genome streamlining and amino acid compositions and the latter relying more on the acquisition of genes associated with acid tolerance. Finally, by the reconstruction of the ancestral states of the optimal growth temperature (OGT) and isoelectric point (pI), we showed the potential evolutionary process of Parvarchaeales-related lineages with regard to the shift from the high-temperature environment of their common ancestors to low-temperature (potentially acidic) environments.","2023","MAR 2023","10.1128/msystems.01252-22","WOS:000954113500001"

Owing to their life cycle of hundreds of years, tea plants are excellent models for studying these entwined relationships; however, observations on this globally important cash crop with numerous health benefits are still rudimentary. Here, the fungal taxa along the soil-tea plant continuum in tea gardens of different ages in famous high-quality tea-growing regions in China were characterized using DNA metabarcoding. Using machine learning, we dissected the spatiotemporal distribution, co-occurrence patterns, assembly, and their associations in different compartments of tea-plant mycobiomes, and further explored how these potential interactions were driven by environmental factors and tree age, and how they influenced the market prices of tea. The results revealed that Compartment niche differentiation was the key driving force behind variation in the tea-plant mycobiome. The mycobiome of roots had the highest specific proportion and convergence and almost did not overlap with the soil. The enrichment ratio of developing leaves to root mycobiome increased with increasing tree age, while mature leaves showed the highest value in the Laobanzhang (LBZ) tea garden with top market prices and displayed the strongest depletion effect on mycobiome association along the soil-tea plant continuum. The balance between determinism and stochasticity in the assembly process was co-driven by compartment niches and life cycle variation. Fungal guild analysis showed that altitude indirectly affected market prices of tea by mediating the abundance of the plant pathogen. The relative importance of plant pathogen and ectomycorrhizae could be used to assess the age of tea. Biomarkers were mainly distributed in soil compartments, and Clavulinopsis miyabeana, Mortierella longata, and Saitozyma sp. may affect the spatiotemporal dynamics of tea-plant mycobiomes and their ecosystem services. Soil properties (mainly total potassium) and tree age indirectly affected the developing leaves via positively influencing the mycobiome of mature leaves. In contrast, the climate directly and significantly drove the mycobiome composition of the developing leaves. Moreover, the proportion of negative correlations in the co-occurrence network positively regulated tea-plant mycobiome assembly, which significantly affected the market prices of tea in the structural equation model with network complexity as hub. These findings indicate that mycobiome signatures play pivotal roles in the adaptive evolution and fungal disease control of tea plants and can help develop better agricultural practices that focus on both plant health and financial profits, and provide a new strategy for assessing tea quality grade and age.","2023","JUN 2023","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164827","WOS:001035475400001"

Strain BO4","APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY","Complete ammonia oxidizers (comammox) are a group of ubiquitous chemolithoautotrophic bacteria capable of deriving energy from the oxidation of ammonia to nitrate via nitrite. Here, we present a study characterizing the comammox strain Nitrospira sp. BO4 using a combination of cultivation-dependent and molecular methods. The enrichment culture BO4 was obtained from the sediment of Lake Burr Oak, a mesotrophic lake in eastern Ohio. The metagenome of the enrichment culture was sequenced, and a metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) was constructed for Nitrospira sp. BO4. The closest characterized relative of Nitrospira sp. BO4 was Candidatus Nitrospira kreftii. All genes for ammonia and nitrite oxidation, reductive tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and other pathways of the central metabolism were detected. Nitrospira sp. BO4 used ammonia and oxidized it to nitrate with nitrite as the intermediate. The culture grew on initial ammonium concentrations between 0.01 and 3 mM with the highest rates observed at the lowest ammonium concentrations. Blue light completely inhibited the growth of Nitrospira sp. BO4, while white light reduced the growth and red light had no effect on the growth. Nitrospira sp. BO4 did not grow on nitrite as its sole substrate. When supplied with ammonium and nitrite, the culture utilized nitrite after most of the ammonium was consumed. In summary, the genomic information of Nitrospira sp. BO4 coupled with the growth experiments shows that Nitrospira sp. BO4 is a freshwater comammox species. Future research will focus on further characterization of the niches of comammox in freshwater environments.IMPORTANCE Nitrification is a key process in the global nitrogen cycle. Complete ammonia oxidizers (comammox) were discovered recently, and only three enrichment cultures and one pure culture have been characterized with respect to activity and growth under different conditions.

Here, we present the first study characterizing a comammox strain obtained from a mesotrophic freshwater lake. In freshwater environments, comammox coexist with ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). Our results will help elucidate physiological characteristics of comammox and the distribution and niche differentiation of different ammonia oxidizers in freshwater environments.

In this study, we isolated a novel Brachybacterium equifaecis JHP9 strain from horse feces and compared its kinetic, biochemical, and genomic features with those of other Brachybacterium strains. Moreover, comparative genomic analysis using publicly available Brachybacterium genomes was performed to determine the properties involved in their ecological adaptation and metabolic potential. Novel species delineation was determined phylogenetically through 16S rRNA gene similarity (up to 97.9%), average nucleotide identity (79.5-82.5%), average amino acid identity (66.7-75.8%), and in silico DNA-DNA hybridization (23.7-27.9) using closely related strains. This study also presents the first report of the kinetic properties of Brachybacterium species. Most of the Brachybacterium strains displayed high oxygen (K-m(app) =1.6-24.2 mu M) and glucose (K-m(app) =0.73-1.22 mu M) affinities, which may manifest niche adaptations. Various carbohydrate metabolisms under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, antibiotic resistance, mobile genetic elements, carbohydrate-active enzymes, lactic acid production, and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-Cas and bacteriophage exclusion systems were observed in the genotypic and/or phenotypic properties of Brachybacterium species, suggesting their genome flexibility, defense mechanisms, and adaptability. Our study contributes to the knowledge of the kinetic, physiological, and genomic properties of Brachybacterium species, including the novel JHP9 strain, which advocates for their tolerant and thriving nature in various environments, leading to their ecological adaptation. IMPORTANCE Basic physiological and genomic properties of most of the Brachybacterium isolates have been studied; however, the ability of this bacterium to adapt to diverse environments, which may demonstrate its role in niche differentiation, is to be identified yet. Therefore, here, we explored cellular kinetics, metabolic diversity, and ecological adaptation/defensive properties of the novel Brachybacterium strain through physiological and comparative genomic analysis. In addition, we presented the first report examining Brachybacterium kinetics, indicating that all strains of Brachybacterium, including the novel one, have high oxygen and glucose affinity. Furthermore, the comparative genomic analysis also revealed that the novel bacterium contains versatile genomic properties, which provide the novel bacterium with significant competitive advantages. Thus, in-depth genotypic and phenotypic analysis with kinetic properties at the species level of this genus is beneficial in clarifying its differential characteristics, conferring the ability to inhabit diverse ecological niches.","2023",NA,"10.1128/spectrum.05048-22","WOS:001107303900235"

Effects of hydrodynamics and supersaturation on the MICP with Sporosarcina pasteurii stains were studied using a high-pressure, rock-on-a-chip microfluidic device. Bacterial cell numbers and variation in cementation concentration controlled the crystal size and pore-scale distribution by influencing the local supersaturation. Local pore structure determined crystal nucleation, where low velocity regions tended to nucleate more crystals. CaCO3 crystallization was observed at subsurface pressure (100 barg) with a reduced sealing performance due to the low microbial activity from elevated pressure.

Make-at-home nasal irrigation solutions are often recommended for treating chronic rhinosinusitis. Many patients will store pre-made solution for convenient use. This study investigated the microbiological properties of differing recipes and storage temperatures. Method. Three irrigation recipes (containing sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and sucrose) were stored at 5 degrees C and 22 degrees C. Further samples were inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Sampling and culturing were conducted at intervals from day 0-12 to examine for bacterial presence or persistence. Results. No significant bacterial growth was detected in any control solution stored at 5 degrees C. Saline solutions remained relatively bacterial free, with poor survival of inoculated bacteria, which may be related to either lower pH or lower osmolality. Storing at room temperature increased the risk of contamination in control samples, particularly from pseudomonas. Conclusion. If refrigerated, pre-made nasal irrigation solutions can be stored safely for up to 12 days without risking cross-contamination to irrigation equipment or patients.","2023","DEC 2022","10.1017/S0022215122002559","WOS:000984090700001"

A reduced sperm quality associated with bacterial contamination was found in 0.5% of 3219 of the samples from insemination centers. In samples spiked with Serratia marcescens and Klebsiella oxytoca, bacterial growth by six log levels was seen during storage at 17 degrees C, causing loss of sperm motility, membrane integrity, membrane fluidity, and mitochondrial membrane potential at >10(7) CFU/mL (p < 0.05). Storage at 5 degrees C in the Androstar Premium extender efficiently inhibited their growth. Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Burkholderia cepacia showed limited growth up to two log levels at 17 degrees C and did not impair sperm quality. In conclusion, spermatozoa tolerate moderate loads of multidrug-resistant bacteria, and hypothermic, antibiotic-free semen storage effectively limits bacterial growth.

To date, the role of OA has primarily been studied in the deactivation of copper-containing preservatives, detoxification of aluminium toxicity and remediation of organic pollutants. During the last two decades, OA has been considered as an antioxidant compound with focus on its potential to enhance crop yield, improve fruit quality, boost nutritional profile, and delay postharvest senescence in fruit and vegetables. It has been established that pre-and postharvest OA application delays ripening and senescence by down-regulating physiological processes such as water loss, ethylene production and respiration. OA treatment controlled adverse storage effects including chilling injury, enzymatic browning, as well as flesh softening by lowering oxidative stress. OA application has also been found to reduce decay in fresh fruit and vegetables by inducing systemic resistance against pathogens, decontamination from surficial microbial load and pesticide residues. Additionally, OA treatments have shown to effectively improve enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants and maintain attributes for eating quality. Effectively, OA application has been deemed to be a potentially food-safe natural and suitable alternative to synthetic chemicals for up-regulating bioactive compounds in harvested fruit and vegetables and extending storability within the postharvest supply chain.

To achieve this, a synergistic solution was developed from a mixture of bay, fenugreek, and lemon extract. A 1:1:1 ratio with an additional 3 % sucrose. It was found effective against Pseudomonas fluo-rescens, Salmonella typhimurium, and Enterobacter cloacae, which are the primary microorganism responsible for the spoilage of rose flowers. GCMS analysis shows that the presence of eugenol, oleic acid, ascorbic acid, car-yophyllene, & PRIME;a-bisabolene, methyl eugenol, & PRIME;a-curcumene, humulene, and allene compounds contributed to the anti-microbial and antioxidant properties of the active matrix. The developed active matrix was coated on a kraft paper called Freshness Keeper (FK). FK paper was subjected to various characterization techniques, such as SEM, FTIR, and GCMS. The study revealed that the mechanical and barrier properties of the paper remained largely unchanged, except for the % elongation break and water absorptiveness. These changes were observed following the paper's coating with the matrix. The results suggest that the coating has the potential to affect the physical properties of the paper. To assess its effectiveness on the vase life and physiochemical characteristics of Rosa hybrida L. cut flowers were tested. The control flowers (without FK) displayed signs of wilting, color change, and bacterial growth after 10-12 d of storage at 2-4 celcius with 85 % relative humidity. In contrast, the FK-wrapped flowers showed similar signs after 18-20 d of storage, effectively enhancing shelf life by an additional 8-10 d. Furthermore, the FK maintained the freshness and diameter of the cut rose bunches, while simultaneously maintaining the petal moisture content, petal color, and sensory attributes and controlling ethylene production.

Additional reduction in bacterial cells during storage after ACP treatment was previously reported. The underlying mechanisms of bacterial inactivation during ACP treatment and post-treatment storage need to be understood. This study investigated the changes in the morpho-physiological status of Listeria monocytogenes on ham surfaces after post-ACP-treatment storage of 1 h, 24 h, and 7 days at 4 degrees C. The membrane integrity, intracellular oxidative stress, and esterase activity of L. monocytogenes were evaluated by flow cytometry. L. monocytogenes cells were under high oxidative stress conditions with slightly permeabilized membranes after 1 h of post-ACP-treatment storage according to the flow cytometry data. During the extended storage of 24 h, the percentage of cells with a slightly permeabilized membrane increased; subsequently, the percentage of cells with intact membranes decreased. The percentage of L. monocytogenes cells with intact membranes decreased to <5% with a treatment time of 10 min and after 7 days of post-treatment storage. In addition, the percentage of L. monocytogenes cells under oxidation stress decreased to <1%, whereas the percentage of cells with completely permeabilized membranes increased to more than 90% for samples treated with ACP for 10 min and 7 days of post-treatment storage. With increased ACP treatment time, for 1 h stored samples, the percentage of cells with active esterase and slightly permeabilized membranes increased. However, during the extended post-treatment storage of 7 days, the percentage of cells with active esterase and slightly permeabilized membranes decreased to below 1%. At the same time, the percentage of cells with permeabilized membrane increased to more than 92% with an increase in ACP treatment time of 10 min.

We evaluated the lignocellulolytic fungal communities by culture method and molecular identification. Litter from T. zebrina decomposed faster than litter from native species. However, the invasion of T. zebrina did not alter decomposition rates of either litter type. Although the lignocellulolytic fungal community composition changed over decomposition time, neither the invasion of T. zebrina nor litter type influenced lignocellulolytic fungal communities.

In patients at low risk of esophageal varices needing treatment (EVNT), non-invasive criteria based on liver stiffness measurement (LSM) with platelets, or fibrosis biomarkers, may avoid unnecessary screening esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGD). These approaches have not been compared among people infected with HIV, HBV, and HCV patients. Methods: Patients with a diagnosis of cACLD (LSM =10 kPa) and EGD availability were included from two cohorts. Baveno VI and expanded Baveno VI criteria (based on LSM and platelets), fibrosis biomarkers Fibrosis-4 Index (FIB-4), AST-to-Platelets Ratio Index (APRI), AST-to-ALT ratio (AAR), and RESIST criteria (based on platelets and albumin) were applied to determine the proportion of spared EGD and of missed EVNT. Results: Three hundred fifty three patients (30.6% with HIV, 25.3% monoinfected with HBV, and 44.1% with HCV) were included. The prevalence of EVNT was 8.2%. Both Baveno VI and expanded Baveno VI criteria performed well in patients with virus-related cACLD, by sparing 26.1% and 51.6% EGD, respectively, while missing <2% EVNT. The proportion of spared EGD were 48.2%, 58%, and 24.3% by FIB-4 (<2.78), APRI (<1.1), and AAR (<0.75), respectively, while missing <3% EVNT. RESIST criteria spared 47.8% EGD while missing 1.9% EVNT.

However, the mechanisms that stabilize this coexistence are not fully understood. Spatial heterogeneity is one common stabilizing mechanism, but the rate at which organisms disperse throughout the heterogeneous environment may strongly impact the stabilizing effect that heterogeneity can provide. An intrigu-ing example is the gut microbiome, where active mechanisms affect the movement of microbes and potentially maintain diversity. We investigate how biodiversity is affected by migration rate using a simple evolutionary model with heterogeneous selection pressure. We find that the biodiversity-migration rate relationship is shaped by multiple phase transitions, including a reentrant phase transition to coexistence. At each transition, an ecotype goes extinct and dynamics exhibit critical slowing down (CSD). CSD is encoded in the statistics of fluctuations due to demographic noise-this may provide an experimental means for detecting and altering impending extinction.","2023",NA,"10.1103/PhysRevE.107.034405","WOS:000962270400005"

We conducted a field experiment to test the role of PSFs in stabilizing coexistence among four dominant sagebrush steppe species that appear to coexist stably, based on previous work with observational data and models. We then integrated the effects of PSF treatments on focal species across germination, survival, and first-year growth. To contribute to stable coexistence, soil microbes should have host-specific effects that result in negative feedbacks. Over two replicated growing seasons, our experiments consistently showed that soil microbes have negative effects on plant growth, but these effects were rarely host-specific. The uncommon host-specific effects were mostly positive at the germination stage, and negative for growth. Integrated effects of PSF across early life-stage vital rates showed that PSF-mediated self-limitation occasionally had large effects on projected plant biomass, but occurred inconsistently between years. Our results suggest that while microbially-mediated PSF may not be a common mechanism of coexistence in this community, it may still affect the relative abundance of dominant plant species via changes in host fitness. Our work also serves as a blueprint for future investigations that aim to identify underlying processes and test alternative mechanisms to explain important patterns in community ecology.","2023","MAY 2023","10.1002/ecy.4056","WOS:000988580100001"

In modern organisms, sophisticated enzymes repair CPD lesions in DNA, but to our knowledge, no RNA-specific enzymes exist for CPD repair. Here, we show for the first time that RNA can protect itself from photolesions by an intrinsic UV-induced self-repair mechanism. This mechanism, prior to this study, has exclusively been observed in DNA and is based on charge transfer from CPD-adjacent bases. In a comparative study, we determined the quantum yields of the self-repair of the CPD-containing RNA sequence, GAU = U to GAUU (0.23%), and DNA sequence, d(GAT = T) to d(GATT) (0.44%), upon 285 nm irradiation via UV/Vis spectroscopy and HPLC analysis. After several hours of irradiation, a maximum conversion yield of similar to 16% for GAU = U and similar to 33% for d(GAT = T) was reached. We examined the dynamics of the intermediate charge transfer (CT) state responsible for the self-repair with ultrafast UV pump - IR probe spectroscopy. In the dinucleotides GA and d(GA), we found comparable quantum yields of the CT state of similar to 50% and lifetimes on the order of several hundred picoseconds. Charge transfer in RNA strands might lead to reactions currently not considered in RNA photochemistry and may help understanding RNA damage formation and repair in modern organisms and viruses. On the UV-rich surface of the early Earth, these self-stabilizing mechanisms likely affected the selection of the earliest nucleotide sequences from which the first organisms may have developed. The absorption of an ultraviolet (UV) photon induces a charge separated state, which can repair an adjacent cyclo-butane-uridine-dimer in RNA.","2023","OCT 2023","10.1039/d3cc04013e","WOS:001089603100001"

However, our understanding of community dynamics, functional profiles, and microbial interactions in blue holes remains limited. We studied the extreme environmental response pattern of the microbiome (Symbiodiniaceae, bacteria, archaea, and fungi) across 14 depths in the world's deepest blue hole, the Sansha Yongle Blue Hole. The alpha-diversities of Symbiodiniaceae and archaea were stable to extreme environmental conditions, whereas those of bacteria and fungi varied. Physical and nutrient factors primarily influenced the beta-diversities of these four microbes, and there were significant differences in microbial communities among water layers. Nine microbial taxa of Cladocopium sp, gamma-proteobacteria, Nanoarchaeota, and Ascomycota representing the core microbiome occurred in all water layers. These four microbial groups exhibited potential interactions, with a positive correlation between Symbiodiniaceae and archaea alpha-diversities. The microbial biogeochemical profiles exhibited notable enrichment characteristics among distinct water layers. Archaea metabolized sulfides in the oxic and upper deep layers, while bacteria dominated sulfide decomposition in the chemocline and lower deep layers. These findings suggest the acclimation of Symbiodiniaceae to an extreme environment may rely on archaea, as a result of a partial niche overlap. The bacterial communities exhibited an environmental response pattern consistent with the Anna Karenina effects, whereas fungal communities displayed an opposite trend. The wide tolerance of the core microbiome to environmental gradients may be linked to evolution, acclimatization, and symbiosis. Bacteria, archaea, and fungi have distinct ecological niches and biogeochemical functions in the Sansha Yongle Blue Hole. IMPORTANCE This study comprehensively examined the community dynamics, functional profiles,profiles, and interactions of the microbiome in the world's deepest blue hole. The findings revealed a positive correlation between the a-diversities of Symbiodiniaceae and archaea, indicating the potential reliance of Symbiodiniaceae on archaea in an extreme environment resulting from a partial niche overlap. The negative association between the alpha-diversity and beta-diversity of the bacterial community suggested that the change rule of the bacterial community was consistent with the Anna Karenina effects.

Using the high-throughput sequencing (HTS) method, the in situ eukaryotic diets of the small cladocerans Penilia avirostris and Pseudevadne tergestina and the calanoid copepod Parvocalanus crassirostris during spring and summer in Daya Bay, South China Sea, were analyzed and their dietary preference and potential niche overlap were described and compared. Approximately 195 operational taxonomic units belonging to metazoans, phytoplankton, protists, and fungi were detected in the gut contents of the 3 species. Overall, animal and phytoplankton prey contributed evenly to the sequences of gut contents of P. avirostris, with diatoms and cnidarians being the most important prey, whereas arthropods were the major prey resource for P. tergestina, with an extremely high percentage (86.2%). P. crassirostris contained a high percentage of phytoplankton prey, with dinoflagellates and diatoms as the major prey (24.3 and 12.9%, respectively). Both P. avirostris and P. crassirostris consumed a higher percentage of phytoplankton with the seasonal transition.

Here we employ a microfluidic chip to represent porous subsurface environments and show that cooperative microbial interactions between free-living and biofilm-forming bacteria trigger active spatial segregation to promote their respective dominance in segregated microhabitats. During initial colonization, free-living and biofilm-forming microbes are segregated from the mixed planktonic inoculum to occupy the ambient fluid and grain surface. Contrary to spatial exclusion through competition, the active spatial segregation is induced by cooperative interactions which improves the fitness of both biofilm and planktonic populations. We further show that free-living Arthrobacter induces the surface colonization by scavenging the biofilm inhibitor, D-amino acids and receives benefits from the public goods secreted by the biofilm-forming strains. Collectively, our results reveal how cooperative microbial interactions may contribute to microbial coexistence in segregated microhabitats and drive subsurface biofilm community succession.

The diversity of vertically stratified microbial communities and the factors controlling the community assemblage pro-cess in the water column above the Haima cold seep were investigated in this study. The prokaryotic community di-versities varied distinctly with vertical changes in hydrochemistry. Cyanobacteria dominated the light-transmitting layers and Proteobacteria dominated the deeper layers. With respect to microbial community assemblages and co -occurrence networks, stochastic processes were particularly important in shaping prokaryotic communities.

Specifically, in bacterial networks, both positive and negative complexity were significantly associated with mean phylogenetic distance, whereas in archaeal networks, only negative complexity correlated with mean phylogenetic distance. Even after accounting for the effects of environmental factors, we observed that phylogenetic relatedness still explained variations in the complexities of bacterial and archaeal associations.

Soil bacterial and fungal communities were profiled using the 16S rRNA and ITS2 gene sequencing, respectively. Under low light, individual PSFs were positively related to shade tolerance, while the least shade-tolerant species produced the most positive PSFs under high light. Pairwise PSFs between species with contrasting shade tolerance were strongly positive under high light but negative under low light, thereby promoting the dominance of less shade-tolerant species in forest gaps and species coexistence under closed canopy, respectively. Under high light, PSFs were related to soil microbial composition and diversity, with the relative abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi being the primary driver of PSFs. Under low light, none of soil microbial properties were significantly related to PSFs.

Primarily, the complexity in predicting the response of organisms to environmental fluctuations is in part because species' responses to abiotic factors are non-linear, even in stable conditions. Temperature exerts a major control over phytoplankton growth and physiology, yet the influence of thermal fluctuations on growth and competition dynamics is largely unknown. To investigate the limits of coexistence in variable environments, stable mixed cultures with constant species abundance ratios of the marine diatoms, Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Thalassiosira pseudonana, were exposed to different temperature fluctuation regimes (n = 17) under high and low nitrogen (N) conditions. Here we demonstrate that phytoplankton exhibit substantial resilience to temperature variability. The time required to observe a shift in the species abundance ratio decreased with increasing fluctuations, but coexistence of the two model species under high N conditions was disrupted only when amplitudes of temperature fluctuation were high (+/- 8.2 degrees C). N limitation caused the thermal amplitude for disruption of species coexistence to become lower (+/- 5.9 degrees C). Furthermore, once stable conditions were reinstated, the two species differed in their ability to recover from temperature fluctuations. Our findings suggest that despite the expectation of unequal effect of fluctuations on different competitors, cycles in environmental conditions may reduce the rate of species replacement when amplitudes remain below a certain threshold. Beyond these thresholds, competitive exclusion could, however, be accelerated, suggesting that aquatic heatwaves and N availability status are likely to lead to abrupt and unpredictable restructuring of phytoplankton community composition .","2023",NA,"10.1002/ece3.9851","WOS:000954435600001"

However, the seasonal variations in microbial community characteristics, particularly phylogenetic group-based community assembly and species coexistence, have not been extensively investigated. Here, we systematically explored the microbiome characteristics and assembly mechanisms of urban rivers in different seasons using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and multivariate statistical methods. The results indicated that the microbial community presented significant temporal heterogeneity in different seasons, and the diversity decreased from spring to winter. The phylogenetic group-based microbial community assembly was governed by dispersal limitation and drift in spring, summer, and autumn but was structured by homogeneous selection in winter. Moreover, the main functions of nitrification, denitrification, and methanol oxidation were susceptible to dispersal limitation and drift processes, whereas sulfate respiration and aromatic compound degradation were controlled by dispersal limitation and homogeneous selection. Network analyses indicated that network complexity decreased and then increased with seasonal changes, while network stability showed the opposite trend, suggesting that higher complexity and diversity reduced community stability. Temperature was determined to be the primary driver of microbial community structure and assembly processes in different seasons based on canonical correspondence analysis and linear regression analysis. In conclusion, seasonal variation drives the dynamics of microbial community assembly and species coexistence patterns in urban rivers.

Such competitive exclusion mechanisms potentially underly microbiome dynamics, causing breakdowns of communities composed of species with similar genetic backgrounds of resource utilization. Although genes responsible for competitive exclusion among a small number of species have been investigated in pioneering studies, it remains a major challenge to integrate genomics and ecology for understanding stable coexistence in species-rich communities. Here, we examine whether community-scale analyses of functional gene redundancy can provide a useful platform for interpreting and predicting collapse of bacterial communities. Through 110-day time-series of experimental microbiome dynamics, we analyzed the metagenome-assembled genomes of co-occurring bacterial species. We then inferred ecological niche space based on the multivariate analysis of the genome compositions. The analysis allowed us to evaluate potential shifts in the level of niche overlap between species through time. We hypothesized that community-scale pressure of competitive exclusion could be evaluated by quantifying overlap of genetically determined resource-use profiles (metabolic pathway profiles) among coexisting species. We found that the degree of community compositional changes observed in the experimental microbiome was correlated with the magnitude of gene-repertoire overlaps among bacterial species, although the causation between the two variables deserves future extensive research.

"Fox, JW","The existence and strength of higher order interactions is sensitive to environmental context","ECOLOGY","One strategy for understanding the dynamics of any complex system, such as a community of competing species, is to study the dynamics of parts of the system in isolation. Ecological communities can be decomposed into single species, and pairs of interacting species. This reductionist strategy assumes that whole-community dynamics are predictable and explainable from knowledge of the dynamics of single species and pairs of species. This assumption will be violated if higher order interactions (HOIs) are strong. Theory predicts that HOIs should be common. But it is difficult to detect HOIs, and to infer their long-term consequences for species coexistence, solely from short-term data. I conducted a protist microcosm experiment to test for HOIs among competing bacterivorous ciliates, and test the sensitivity of HOIs to environmental context. I grew three competing ciliate species in all possible combinations at each of two resource enrichment levels, and used the population dynamic data from the one- and two-species treatments to parameterize a competition model at each enrichment level. I then compared the predictions of the parameterized model to the dynamics of the whole community (three-species treatment). I found that the existence, and thus strength, of HOIs was environment dependent. I found a strong HOI at low enrichment, which enabled the persistence of a species that would otherwise have been competitively excluded. At high enrichment, three-species dynamics could be predicted from a parameterized model of one- and two-species dynamics, provided that the model accounted for nonlinear intraspecific density dependence. The results provide one of the first rigorous demonstrations of the long-term consequences of HOIs for species coexistence, and demonstrate the context dependence of HOIs. HOIs create difficult challenges for predicting and explaining species coexistence in nature.","2023","SEP 2023","10.1002/ecy.4156","WOS:001066384700001"

Massive ice loss and warming in the poorly studied Arctic Chukchi Borderland are hypothesized to affect this coupling. The strength of pelagic-benthic coupling was compared between 2 years varying in climate settings, 2005 and 2016, based on delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotopes of food-web end-members and pelagic and deep-sea benthic consumers. Considerably higher isotopic niche overlap and generally shorter isotopic distance were found between pelagic and benthic food web components in 2005 than in 2016, suggesting weaker coupling in the latter, low-ice year. delta N-15 values indicated more refractory food consumed by benthos in 2016 and fresher food reaching the seafloor in 2005. Higher delta C-13 values of zooplankton indirectly suggested a higher contribution of ice algae in 2005 than 2016. The difference in pelagic-benthic coupling between these years is consistent with higher energy retention within the pelagic system, perhaps due to strong stratification in the Amerasian Basin in the recent decade. Weaker coupling to the benthos can be expected to continue with ice loss in the study area, perhaps reducing benthic biomass and remineralization capacity; monitoring of the area is needed to confirm this prediction.","2023",NA,"10.1038/s41598-023-33854-0","WOS:000984494600009"

Multi-tissue stable isotope analyses of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur were used to examine (1) ontogenetic and sex-specific variability in the reliance of resource pools; (2) variation in isotopic niche breadth within and among populations; and (3) seasonal variability in resource use within juvenile life stages. We found evidence for subtle ontogenetic shifts in resource use, with increased contributions of phytoplankton with ontogeny, but all age groups predominantly relied on sedimentary organic matter (SOM) pools. Sex-specific differences in resource use were observed with SOM serving as the predominant source assimilated in males, while females exhibited a higher dependence on phytoplankton resource pools, indicating foraging or spatial preferences may be different between sexes. Low trophic niche overlap between adult and juvenile horseshoe crabs was evident, likely arising from differences in migratory patterns and size constraints. Within juveniles, no seasonal differences in resource use were observed, indicating that dietary patterns may remain static across temporal scales, consistent with limited dispersal of that life stage. Spatial differences in resource use were, however, observed between adult crabs likely reflecting the migratory strategies of different populations.

Antibiotic treatment significantly impacts the human gut microbiota, but quantitative understanding of how antibiotics affect community diversity is lacking. Here, we build on classical ecological models of resource competition to investigate community responses to species-specific death rates, as induced by antibiotic activity or other growth-inhibiting factors such as bacteriophages. Our analyses highlight the complex dependence of species coexistence that can arise from the interplay of resource competition and antibiotic activity, independent of other biological mechanisms. In particular, we identify resource competition structures that cause richness to depend on the order of sequential application of antibiotics (non-transitivity), and the emergence of synergistic and antagonistic effects under simultaneous application of multiple antibiotics (non-additivity). These complex behaviors can be prevalent, especially when generalist consumers are targeted. Communities can be prone to either synergism or antagonism, but typically not both, and antagonism is more common. Furthermore, we identify a striking overlap in competition structures that lead to non-transitivity during antibiotic sequences and those that lead to non-additivity during antibiotic combination.

The primary carbon sources for the 4 shark species, determined via stable isotope mixing models, were consistently phytoplankton (mean +/- SD: 65.8 +/- 4.8%) and microphytobenthos (18.6 +/- 5.4%), regardless of tissue type. However, interspecific isotopic niche overlap between any 2 species ranged widely (0-92%). The niche space occupied exclusively by one species also varied considerably but was lowest for blacktips (<20%) and highest for bonnetheads (>90%). Isotopic niche size estimated using short-term tissues, was substantially larger for 3 of the 4 species (Atlantic sharpnose, 41% increase; blacknose, 140%; blacktips, 159%) than long-term tissues.

Eurasia harbours invaded and native areas of both pathogens and the natural habitats where they co-exist, making it an ideal region to examine their environmental niche correlations. Our understanding of how climate change will affect their distribution is broadened by the differences in climate correlates and niche characteristics between Bd and Bsal in Asia and Europe. This knowledge has potential conservation implications, informing future spread of the disease in different regions.ResultsWe quantified the environmental niche overlap between Bd and Bsal in Eurasia using niche analyses. Results revealed partial overlap in the niche with a unique 4% of non-overlapping values for Bsal, suggesting segregation along certain climate axes. Bd tolerates higher temperature fluctuations, while Bsal requires more stable, lower temperature and wetter conditions. Projections of their Realized Climatic Niches (RCNs) to future conditions show a larger expansion of suitable ranges (SRs) for Bd compared to Bsal in both Asia and Europe, with their centroids shifting in different directions.

Microbial populations have evolved diverse strategies to circumvent competitive interactions and facilitate coexistence. Here, we show that nutrient use of soilborne Streptomyces is temporally partitioned during experimental resource pulses, leading to reduced niche overlap, and potential coexistence. Streptomyces grew rapidly on the majority of distinct 95 carbon sources but varied in which individual resources were utilized in the first 24 h. Only a handful of carbon sources (19 out of 95) were consistently utilized (>95% of isolates) most rapidly in the first 24 h. These consistently utilized carbon sources also generated the majority of biomass accumulated by isolates. Our results shed new light on a novel mechanism microbes may employ to alleviate competitive interactions by temporally partitioning the consumption of carbon resources. As competitive interactions have been proposed to drive the suppression of disease-causing microbes in agronomic soils, our findings may hold widespread implications for soil management for plant health.","2023","SEP 2023","10.1111/1462-2920.16498","WOS:001069960500001"

However, we still generally lack the mechanistic knowledge of what determines the success of probiotic application, hampering the development of reliable disease suppression strategies. We conducted a three-season consecutive microcosm experiment in which we amended banana Fusarium wilt disease-conducive soil with Trichoderma-amended biofertilizer or lacking this inoculum. High-throughput sequencing was complemented with cultivation-based methods to follow changes in fungal microbiome and explore potential links with plant health. Trichoderma application increased banana biomass by decreasing disease incidence by up to 72%, and this effect was attributed to changes in fungal microbiome, including the reduction in Fusarium oxysporum density and enrichment of pathogen-suppressing fungi (Humicola). These changes were accompanied by an expansion in microbial carbon resource utilization potential, features that contribute to disease suppression. We further demonstrated the disease suppression actions of Trichoderma-Humicola consortia, and results suggest niche overlap with pathogen and induction of plant systemic resistance may be mechanisms driving the observed biocontrol effects. Together, we demonstrate that fungal inoculants can modify the composition and functioning of the resident soil fungal microbiome to suppress soilborne disease.","2023","FEB 2023","10.1111/nph.18793","WOS:000939015900001"

We used high-throughput sequencing to examine the assembly of rare and abundant subcommunities in a heavily polluted urban river: the Beiyun River in Beijing, China. Although deterministic processes overrode stochastic processes in shaping local rare and abundant subcommunities, there were distinctly different assembly mechanisms of rare and abundant subcommunities. Rare subcommunity assembly was governed more by interspecific interactions, and environmental selection and dispersal limitation explained only a small fraction of the variation. However, both factors seemed to govern the assembly of abundant subcommunities. Our results implied that microbial co-occurrence associations tended to be higher when rare subcommunities were less driven by community assembly, and that these associations tended to be lower when abundant subcommunities were more driven by community assembly. A balance between the community assembly and species coexistence was exhibited at the subcommunity level. Importantly, we tried to disentangle the assembly process of abundant subcommunities into introduction and colonization processes characterized by the presence/absence and relative abundance datasets. Interestingly, metals explained the highest percentage of spatial variation in the species introduction process. By affecting nutrient availability, metals also shaped the abundant subcommunity in the species colonization process, but this did not surpass nutrient availability. Therefore, disentangling the introduction and colonization processes enhances our understanding of the assembly mechanisms of microbial communities in heavily polluted running water ecosystems at fine geographical scales.","2023","JAN 2023","10.1016/j.envint.2023.107747","WOS:000924335200001"

In an experimental setting, the composition of ecological communities can be manipulated directly. Starting from a pool of n species, it is possible to co-culture species in different combinations, ranging from monocultures, to pairs, and all the way up to the full species pool. Leveraging datasets with this experimental design, we advance methods to infer species interactions using density measurements taken at a single time point across a variety of distinct community compositions.2. First, we introduce a fast and robust algorithm to estimate parameters for simple statistical models describing these data, which can be combined with likelihood maximization approaches. Second, we derive from consumer- resource dynamics a family of statistical models with few parameters, which can be applied to study systems where only a small fraction of the potential community compositions have been observed. Third, we show how a Weighted Least Squares framework can be used to account for the fact that species abundances often display a strong relationship between means and variances.3. To illustrate our approach, we analyse datasets spanning plant, bacteria and phytoplankton communities, as well as simulations, consistently recovering a good fit to the data and demonstrating the ability of our methods to predict equilibrium densities in out - of-sample communities.4. By combining more robust model structures and fitting procedures along with a more flexible error model, we greatly extend the applicability of recently proposed methods to model community composition from experimental data, opening the door for the analysis of larger pools of species using sparser and noisier datasets than was previously possible.","2023","NOV 2022","10.1111/2041-210X.14028","WOS:000912495500001"

Fungicides are commonly used to control foliar diseases and increase grain yield, but have limited efficacy against F. verticillioides and may even stimulate the fungus to produce mycotoxins. Biocontrol can reduce F. verticillioides populations and fumonisin, but little is known about the resulting microbial interactions on the phylloplane and their relationship with F. verticillioides. This study aimed at evaluating the impact of different foliar treatments on the cultivable phylloplane community of fungi and bacteria and their potential in controlling F. verticillioides in maize. Results showed that two sprays of Bacillus subtilis BIOUFLA2 increased the percentage of native phylloplane antagonist bacteria and fungi against F. verticillioides by 25.0% and 27.3%, respectively, compared with the water control. However, two sprays with a triazole + strobilurin fungicide at different phenological stages in maize reduced such antagonistic communities. From field trials, 34 bacteria and 13 fungi from the phylloplane were selected for their inhibitory activity against F. verticillioides, with most coming from the exclusive treatment with BIOUFLA2. The study also revealed that the biocontrol agent-recruited phylloplane indigenous lineages act through antibiosis, competition, and parasitism. Therefore, the adoption of biocontrol to limit F. verticillioides population build-up not only has a direct activity on the pathogen but also recruits fungal and bacterial antagonists that may act additively or synergistically with the applied biocontrol agent.","2023","OCT 2023","10.1111/jph.13226","WOS:001091615700001"

We quantified the microbial colonization and dynamic of niche structure to emphasize the home-field advantages for native microbial inoculants.A native SynCom of 21 bacterial strains, originating from three typical agricultural soils, conferred a special advantage in promoting maize growth under low-fertility conditions. The root : shoot ratio of fresh weight increased by 78-121% with SynCom but only 23-86% with PGPRs. This phenotype correlated with the potential robust colonization of SynCom and positive interactions with the resident community. Niche breadth analysis revealed that SynCom inoculation induced a neutral disturbance to the niche structure. However, even PGPRs failed to colonize the natural soil, they decreased niche breadth and increased niche overlap by 59.2-62.4%, exacerbating competition.These results suggest that the home-field advantage of native microbes may serve as a basis for engineering crop microbiomes to support food production in widely distributed poor soils.","2023","MAY 2023","10.1111/nph.18943","WOS:000982837800001"

Results showed that the mean trophic level of the NBoB ecosystem was 3.146. The ecotrophic efficiency of the ecosystem ranged from 0.510 to 0.995. Species such as Arius spp., Tenualosa ilisha and Harpadon nehereus showed higher ecotrophic efficiencies which suggested that those species were highly exploited. The total system throughput was 4163.712 t/km2/year. Further, Finn's cycling index was 14.39% of the total ecosystem throughput and the Finn's mean path length was 3.203. The ratio of total primary production to total respiration was 1.445 and the total transfer efficiency of the NBoB ecosystem was 16.43%. Those statistics suggested that the NBoB is a highly efficient detritus-based ecosystem which is possibly in its early stage of maturity. The mixed trophic impact analysis showed that the majority of the functional groups had negatively affected the trophic interactions of the NBoB ecosystem but the detritus, phytoplankton, benthos and non-penaeid shrimps had positively affected the trophic interactions. Use of trawl and bag nets had considerable negative impacts on the various functional groups of the NBoB ecosystem. In the NBoB ecosystem elasmobranchs was the keystone group. Upeneus spp. and Polynemidae, and Caranx spp. and Carangidae had considerable niche overlaps in the NBoB ecosystem.

We showed that plant root endospheric mycobiota were sensitive to corridor effects when the corridors were set up at a small spatial scale. The endospheric mycobiota of connected plants had higher species richness, lower beta-diversity, and more deterministic assembly than the mycobiota of isolated plants.

We found that the DDRs might be weakened by anthropogenic disturbances, which were not observed in tilled soils, while a decreasing trend was observed along the soil horizon in untilled soils. The relative importance of environmental factors and geographic distance varied with soil tillage. Specifically, bacterial communities in tilled soils were driven by non-spatially autocorrelated environmental factors, while untilled soils were more susceptible to geographic distance. In addition, the heterogeneity of soil properties, as well as the differences in soil bacterial niche width and niche overlap, determined the assembly processes of the bacterial community, resulting in opposite trends along the soil layers in tilled and untilled soils.

Microorganisms thriving in AMD habitats have evolved with distinct mechanisms in response to multiple stresses. Compared with microbial prokaryotes, our understanding regarding eukaryotic occurrence and role in AMD habitats remain limited. Here we examined microbial diversity and co-occurrence pattern within all domains of life in five lakes with varying degrees of AMD contamination ranging from extremely acidic to neutral. We demonstrated that AMD pollution reduced both eukaryotic and prokaryotic diversity in the lakes. In lakes with serious AMD pollution, chemoautotrophs including Ferrovum, Acidithiobacillus, and Leptospirillum showed significantly higher abundance, whereas with the macroscopic growths of photosynthetic microalgae (e.g., Coccomyxa and Chlamydomonas), heterotrophic or mixotrophic prokaryotes (e.g., Acidiphilium, Thiomonas, and Alicyclobacillus) increased in less polluted lakes. In the further improved ecosystems, Ochromonas, Rotifer, Ciliophora and other microeukaryotes appeared. Combined with a public dataset focusing on the microbes along an AMD-contaminated stream, we further demonstrated that acidity-dominated environmental selection served as the primary driver of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic community assemblies, and to a greater extent for eukaryotes. Furthermore, specific prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa (e.g., Proteobacteria and Chlorophyta) exhibited wide taxonomic and functional associations in these AMD-polluted waters. These findings expand our knowledge on the eukaryotic diversity in AMD habitats, and provide insights into the ecological processes underlying microbial communities in response to AMD contamination.","2023","SEP 2022","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158954","WOS:000870101000015"

In addition, functional differences between interacting species should modulate their response ability to other environmental factors. Thus, it should be expected that the effects of the BSC on plants will be significantly determined by the own functional diversity in the community. To understand the multiple effects of BSC and the extent to which the functional diversity of interacting plant species can modulate their effects on the development of coexisting species, we applied an experimental approach by manipulating the initial functional diversity of the entire annual plant community and BSC conditions in a common garden trial. We crossed three sorts of assemblages built on the basis of plant stature (combinations of only large, or only small, or diverse sized plant species in pots) with three lichen-dominated BSC disturbance scenarios (intact, or tiny mechanically disaggregated, or absent portions of BSC). BSC strongly affected the establishment and development of gypsophilous annual plants in a complex, multifaceted manner, which shifted throughout the plant life cycle. We demonstrated that lichen-dominated BSC could act as a major physical barrier to the establishment of annual plants at a heterogeneous fine spatial scale. Such a restrictive effect was particularly marked in the presence of intact BSC. However, after annual plants overcame the restrictions imposed by BSC, the same biotic layer facilitated plant growth and fitness, regardless of its physical integrity, resulting in larger plants producing more fruits. Importantly, our results suggest that the functional diversity structure of the community may also drive growth and fitness of coexisting species by activating alternative coexistence mechanisms such as niche partitioning or competition symmetry. This study highlights the importance of plant neighbourhood features for the performance of interacting species, and confirms a novel, experimental way to explore the effects of community diversity on plants for the interpretation of assembly mechanisms.

Here, satisfactory wastewater treatment efficiency was observed in a microalgae-bacteria consortia (MBC) over a wide temperature range because of the predominance of microalgae. Microalgae contributed more toward wastewater treatment at low temperature because of the unsatisfactory performance of the accompanying bacteria, which experienced cold stress (e.g., bacterial abundance below 3000 sequences) and executed defensive strategies (e.g., enrichment of cold-shock proteins). A low abundance of amoA-C and hao indicated that conventional nitrogen removal was replaced through the involvement of microalgae. Diverse heterotrophic bacteria for nitrogen removal were identified at medium and high temperatures, implying this microbial niche treatment contained diverse flexible consortia with temperature variation. Additionally, pathogenic bacteria were eliminated through microalgal photosynthesis. After fitting the neutral community model and calculating the ecological niche, microalgae achieved a maximum niche breadth of 5.21 and the lowest niche overlap of 0.38, while the accompanying bacterial community in the consortia were shaped through deterministic processes. Finally, the maximum energy yield of 87.4 kJ L-1 and lipid production of 1.9 g L-1 were achieved at medium temperature.

We tested this by measuring plant-pollinator interactions and virus infections (DWV-A, DWV-B and ABPV) across pollinator communities in agricultural landscapes over a year. AES had a direct effect on DWV-B, reducing prevalence and load in honeybees, with a tentative general dilution effect on load in early summer. DWV-A prevalence was reduced both under AES and with increasing niche overlap between competent hosts, likely via a dilution effect. By contrast, AES had no impact on ABPV, its prevalence driven by the proportion of bumblebees in the community. Epidemiological differences were also reflected in the virus phylogenies, with DWV-B showing recent rapid expansion, while DWV-A and ABPV showed slower growth rates and geographical population structure. Phylogenies indicate that all three viruses freely circulate across their host populations.

Further the associative aspects between the assemblage members and between them and habitat attributes were accounted for by analyzing the niche overlap based on Pearson correlation coefficients. Using variation parti-tioning and null models, we found that the generic diversity of the assemblage was more strongly determined by non-registered lateral experimental factors (stochastic control). By contrast, the deterministic control-less strong than the stochastic counterpart-was exerted both in synchronization with the changes in habitat char-acteristics and/or with a time delay. The network analysis showed that, under favorable habitat conditions in July, September and October, reduced network modularity and enhanced connectivity were favored, which probably led to a niche-based deterministic selection that outperformed stochasticity.

Hence, a systematic understanding of the coexistence pattern of rhizo-sphere microorganisms under stress is essential for the precise development and utilization of synthetic microbial communities and the achievement of efficient ecological control. Here, we integrated current analytical methods and introduced several new experimental methods to elucidate rhizosphere microbial coexistence patterns. Some advancements (e.g., network analysis, coculture experiments, and synthetic communities) that can be applied to plant stress resistance are also updated. This review aims to summarize the key role and potential application prospects of microbial coexistence in the resistance of plants to environmental stresses. Our suggestions, enhancing plant resistance with coexisting microbes, would allow us to gain further knowledge on plant-microbial and microbial-microbial functions, and facilitate translation to more effective measures.","2023","JAN 2023","10.1016/j.envres.2023.115298","WOS:000963161500001"

Petroleum hydrocarbon contamination is expected to affect microbial ecological characteristics and the ecological services they provide. In this study, the multifunctionalities of contaminated and uncontaminated soils in an aged petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated field and their correlation with soil microbial characteristics were analyzed to explore the effect of petroleum hydrocarbons on soil microbes. MethodsSoil physicochemical parameters were determined to calculate soil multifunctionalities. In addition, 16S high-throughput sequencing technology and bioinformation analysis were used to explore microbial characteristics. ResultsThe results indicated that high concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons (565-3,613 mg & BULL;kg(-1), high contamination) reduced soil multifunctionality, while low concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons (13-408 mg & BULL;kg(-1), light contamination) might increase soil multifunctionality. In addition, light petroleum hydrocarbon contamination increased the richness and evenness of microbial community (p < 0.01), enhanced the microbial interactions and widened the niche breadth of keystone genus, while high petroleum hydrocarbon contamination reduced the richness of the microbial community (p < 0.05), simplified the microbial co-occurrence network, and increased the niche overlap of keystone genus. ConclusionOur study demonstrates that light petroleum hydrocarbon contamination has a certain improvement effect on soil multifunctionalities and microbial characteristics. While high contamination shows an inhibitory effect on soil multifunctionalities and microbial characteristics, which has significance for the protection and management of petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated soil.","2023",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2023.1188229","WOS:001016019000001"

The dichotomies are usually qualitative and/or study-specific, sometimes precluding clear-cut results interpretation. We can unravel microbial dichotomies as life history strategies by combining ecology theory with Monod curves, a laboratory mathematical tool of bacterial physiology that relates the specific growth rate of a microbe with the concentration of a limiting nutrient. Fitting of Monod curves provides quantities that directly correspond to key parameters in ecological theories addressing species coexistence and diversity, such as r/K selection theory, resource competition and community structure theory and the CSR triangle of life strategies. The resulting model allows us to reconcile the copiotrophic/oligotrophic and fast/slow-growing dichotomies as different subsamples of a life history strategy triangle that also includes r/K strategists. We also used the number of known carbon sources together with community structure theory to partially explain the diversity of heterotrophic microbes observed in metagenomics experiments. In sum, we propose a theoretical framework for the study of natural microbial communities that unifies several existing proposals. Its application would require the integration of metagenomics, metametabolomics, Monod curves and carbon source data.","2023","SEP 2023","10.1111/1462-2920.16495","WOS:001060144200001"

Chilean temperate rainforests, located in two mountain systems (Andes and Coast), offer a model system with contrasting geological histories and forest mycorrhizal dominance: Nothofagus spp. forests (dominated by ectomycorrhizal (EM) trees), Valdivian forests and coniferous forests (both dominated by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) trees). This study aimed to test the effects of mountain system, forest mycorrhizal dominance, and edaphic conditions on soil fungal communities of southern Chile's temperate rainforests. Here, we describe soil fungal communities using ITS2 Illumina sequencing and implemented standard soil chemical analyses. The Andes and Coast mountain systems differed in terms of community composition of total, saprotrophic, EM, and plant pathogenic fungi. Forest mycorrhizal dominance was related to the fungal community composition of total, saprotrophic, and EM fungi. Among soil conditions, only pH affected the total fungi community composition (also affecting EM and plant pathogens), while redox potential was related to saprotrophic (also affected by available P) and EM fungal communities. The composition of plant pathogenic fungal communities was also related to soil C and N. EM fungal richness/abundance was higher in Andean EM tree-dominated forests, while saprotrophic fungi richness and abundance were higher in AM tree-dominated forests.

We demonstrated that the richness and diversity of the pathogenic communities were primarily controlled by soil depth, while the structure and composition of pathogenic communities varied pronouncedly with seasonal changes, which were driven by the alterations in both physiochemical parameters and organic contaminants over time. Network analysis revealed that the overwhelmingly positive interactions, identified multiple keystone species, and a well organized modular structure maintained the stability and functionality of the pathogenic communities under environmental pressures. Additionally, the null-model analysis showed that deterministic processes dominated the pathogenic community assembly across soil profiles.

This study comprehensively investigated the global assembly mechanisms of microbial communities and effects of community-internal influencing factors using the Earth Microbiome Project (EMP) data set. We found that deterministic and stochastic processes contribute approximately equally to global microbial community assembly, and, specifically, deterministic processes generally play a major role in free-living and plant-associated (but not plant corpus) environments, while stochastic processes are the major contributor in animal-associated environments. In contrast with the assembly of microorganisms, the assembly of functional genes, predicted from PICRUSt, is mainly attributed to deterministic processes in all microbial communities. The sink and source microbial communities are normally assembled using similar mechanisms, and the core microorganisms are specific to different environment types. On a global scale, deterministic processes are positively related to the community alpha diversity, microbial interaction degree and bacterial predatory-specific gene abundance. Our analysis provides a panoramic picture and regularities of global and environment-typical microbial community assemblies. IMPORTANCE With the development of sequencing technologies, the research topic of microbial ecology has evolved from the analysis of community composition to community assembly, including the relative contribution of deterministic and stochastic processes for the formation and maintenance of community diversity. Many studies have reported the microbial assembly mechanisms in various habitats, but the assembly regularities of global microbial communities remain unknown. In this study, we analyzed the EMP data set using a combined pipeline to explore the assembly mechanisms of global microbial communities, microbial sources to construct communities, core microbes in different environment types, and community-internal factors influencing assembly.

Theoretically, plants can modify soil biotic communities (e.g. fungal and bacterial communities) sequentially via rhizo-inputs in the growing season and via litter decomposition in the non-growing season, and in this way affect the performance of plant individuals that establish in the same soil in the following growing season. However, how plants affect soil microbes via sequential rhizosphere and litter inputs and how these soil microbial legacies feedback to subsequent plants remains unclear. Here, we first explored the sequential effects of living individuals and their leaf litter on soil fungal communities, using 42 common alien and native species in China, and then estimated their PSF effects on three common test species. Our results show that living plants growing in field soil developed distinct rhizosphere fungal communities within one season. After the removal of conditioning plants, the fungal communities in these conditioned soils changed more dramatically in the absence than in the presence of leaf litter, suggesting that leaf litter inputs prolonged the species-specific legacies that conspecific living individuals exerted in the soil. Moreover, leaf litter induced general negative effects on all test species in the second growing season. Conditioning plant origin (native vs. alien) and life cycle (annual vs. perennial), respectively, had a slight or no impact on fungal community composition, and conditioning plant origin did not affect PSF responses of the test species. Synthesis: These findings show that leaf litter prolongs soil fungal legacies of conspecific living individuals, which can lead to carryover effects on heterospecific plant growth in the next season. Our findings highlight the importance of leaf litter for plant-soil interactions and thereby stress the potential importance of plant litter as a driver of plant community dynamics.","2023","JUN 2023","10.1111/1365-2745.14157","WOS:001016054100001"

The research to date on microbes under simulated space factors has pri-marily been carried out on single bacterial species under the individual effects of microgravity or low-dose ra-diation. However, microgravity (MG) and low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR) coexist in the actual spacecraft environment, and microorganisms coexist as communities in the spacecraft environment. Thus, the microbial response to the real changes present during space habitation has not been adequately explored. To address this knowledge gap, we compared the dynamics of community composition and antibiotic resistance of synthetic bacterial communities under simulated microgravit, low-dose ionizing radiation, and the conditions combined, as it occurs in spacecraft. To ensure representative bacteria were selected, we co-cultured of 12 bacterial strains isolated from spacecraft cleanrooms. We found that the weakened competition between communities increased the possibility of species coexistence, community diversity, and homogeneity. The number of Bacilli increased significantly, while different species under the combined conditions showed various changes in abundance compared to those under the individual conditions. The resistance of the synthetic community to penicillins increased significantly under low doses of ionizing radiation but did not change significantly under simulated microgravity or the combined conditions.

In this study, metagenomic genes encoding microbial CAZymes and sugar transporter systems were predicted to assess the microbial glycan niches and functional potentials of glycan utilization in the inner shelf of the Pearl River Estuary (PRE). The CAZymes gene compositions were significantly different between in free-living (0.2-3 & mu;m, FL) and particle-associated (>3 & mu;m, PA) bacteria of the water column and between water and surface sediments, reflecting glycan niche separation on size fraction and selective degradation in depth. Proteobacteria and Bacteroidota had the highest abundance and glycan niche width of CAZymes genes, respectively. At the genus level, Alteromonas (Gammaproteobacteria) exhibited the greatest abundance and glycan niche width of CAZymes genes and were marked by a high abundance of periplasmic transporter protein TonB and members of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS). The increasing contribution of genes encoding CAZymes and transporters for Alteromonas in bottom water contrasted to surface water and their metabolism are tightly related with particulate carbohydrates (pectin, alginate, starch, lignin-cellulose, chitin, and peptidoglycan) rather than on the utilization of ambient-water DOC. Candidatus Pelagibacter (Alphaproteobacteria) had a narrow glycan niche and was primarily preferred for nitrogen-containing carbohydrates, while their abundant sugar ABC (ATP binding cassette) transporter supported the scavenging mode for carbohydrate assimilation. Planctomycetota, Verrucomicrobiota, and Bacteroidota had similar potential glycan niches in the consumption of the main component of transparent exopolymer particles (sulfated fucose and rhamnose containing polysaccharide and sulfated-N-glycan), developing considerable niche overlap among these taxa. The most abundant CAZymes and transporter genes as well as the widest glycan niche in the abundant bacterial taxa implied their potential key roles on the organic carbon utilization, and the high degree of glycan niches separation and polysaccharide composition importantly influenced bacterial communities in the coastal waters of PRE.

Plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) are one of the major drivers of species coexistence in highly dynamic and low-diversity communities, such as early successional stands or agricultural systems. However, in stable and species-rich communities, PSFs are much more complex because of numerous species interactions. In this study, we aimed to reveal if PSFs of a dominant species can be detected within a diverse plant community and to what extent they can be influenced by the effects of co-occurring species.2. We investigated PSFs between a dominant grass, Festuca rubra, and three other species from a species-rich mountain grassland, taking advantage of the 18-year field removal experiment. We tested whether such a long-term presence/absence of Festuca can shape the feedback of the grassland community and whether these effects prevail in the lower soil layer, where Festuca roots are relatively more abundant, compared to the upper soil layer. We evaluated how experimentally induced soil legacies of Festuca in a pot experiment are modified by subsequently grown plants, both at the level of plant responses and changes in abiotic and biotic soil properties.3. At the level of the entire community, the soil legacies of the dominant Festuca were not detectable. However, the responses of the plants differed between the soil samples from the upper and lower soil layer. The pot experiment showed that the soil legacies of subsequently growing plants interact, influencing soil properties as well as plant responses to these altered soils. Generally, we found a stronger signal of the most recent conditioning, although the effect of the first conditioning plant was still detectable in many of the measured variables. Plant biomass in the feedback phase was mainly linked to the levels of plant-available soil nitrogen, although it was also affected by the composition of microbial communities.4. Synthesis. We showed that plant-induced soil legacies can be altered by legacies of co-occurring species, complicating plant-soil feedbacks in diverse communities.

"Senthilnathan, A; D'Andrea, R","Niche theory for positive plant-soil feedbacks","ECOLOGY","Interactions between plants and the soil are an important ecological process in terrestrial ecosystems as they affect plant community structure: when and where we find different plant species. Those interactions are typically thought of as one-directional: local soil conditions filter through dispersing species to produce a community of locally adapted plants. However, plants can modify local physicochemical soil conditions via their roots and associations with soil microbes. These may in turn affect the local fitness of other plants, making plant-soil interactions bidirectional. In order to understand how they differ from other ecological processes that structure plant communities, we need a theory connecting these individual-level plant-soil feedbacks to community-level patterns. Here, we build this theory with a mathematical model of plant community dynamics in which soil conditioning is explicitly modeled over time and depends on the density of the plants. We analyze this model to describe the long-term composition and spatial distribution of the plant community. Our main result is that positive plant-soil feedbacks will create clustering of species with similar soil preferences. The composition of these clusters is further influenced by niche width and conditioning strength. In contrast with competitive dynamics driven by niche overlap, only species belonging to the same cluster can maintain high relative abundance in the community. Spatial heterogeneity in the form of an environmental gradient generates patches, each representing a single cluster. However, such patchiness is disfavored when species differ in dispersal ability. We show that stronger dispersers cannot take over the habitat as long as an exogenous driver favors soil conditions that benefit the other species. If exogenous drivers supersede soil conditioning by plants, we retrieve classic habitat filtering, where species are selected based on their suitability to the local environment. Overall, we provide a novel mathematical model for positive plant-soil feedback that we use to describe the spatial patterns of plant abundance and traits related to soil preference and conditioning ability.","2023","FEB 2023","10.1002/ecy.3993","WOS:000940433300001"

Staphylococcus xylosus Sx8 and Staphylococcus equorum Se31 have been previously proposed as biocontrol agents (BCAs) to prevent the OTA contamination, although their antifungal mode of action has not been established yet. Thus, the aim of this work was to elucidate their mode of action against P. nordicum in a dry-cured ham model system. For this, the effect of live cells, dead cells, and cell-free broth; the nutritional utilisation pattern, niche overlap index (NOI), interactions by dual-culture assays, antifungal effect of volatile compounds, OTA detoxification, and effect on fungal proteome were determined. No fungal growth was observed after 14 days of co-culture with live cells of each staphylococcus at 15 or 20 & DEG;C. However, such inhibition was not observed with either dead cells or extracellular extracts. The number of carbon sources utilised by P. nordicum was higher than those used by both cocci at 20 & DEG;C, whilst the opposite occurred at 15 & DEG;C. According to NOI, nutritional dominance depends on temperature, at 20 & DEG;C P. nordicum dominated the niche, but at 15 & DEG;C the mould is dominated by the BCAs. The volatile pattern generated by each coccus did not show antifungal effect, and both staphylococci failed to degrade or adsorb OTA. However, in the interaction assay, S. xylosus and S. equorum were able to decrease the fungal growth and its OTA production. In addition, proteomic analyses showed changes in the abundance of proteins related to the cell wall integrity (CWI), carbohydrate metabolism and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites such as OTA. In conclusion, overall, the antagonistic effects of the two studied cocci against P. nordicum are greater at 15 & DEG;C than at 20 & DEG;C, being linked to competition for space and nutrients, triggering alterations in CWI pathway, OTA biosynthesis, and carbohydrate metabolism.","2023","JUL 2023","10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2023.110342","WOS:001049656100001"

Nitrate addition significantly accelerated AnAOB enrichment startup, particularly during nitrite accumulation phase. The total start-up time was shortened by 55-71 days, compared to the reactor without nitrate. In R1 (nitrite/nitrate=10:0), anammox contributed the highest nitrogen removal percentage (91%), while R2 (nitrite/nitrate=7:3), with nitrate added, exhibited the highest anammox activity (53.84 mg NH4+-N/g VSS/day) in the steady-state phase. As nitrate proportions increased (R3-R5), anammox activity gradually declined due to limited available COD required for the conversion of NO3 - to NO2- . Furthermore, it was found that nitrate-added improved the sludge settleability, with lower SVI30. 16S rRNA gene revealed that Ca. Brocadia was the predominant AnAOB in R1, R2 and R3, where nitrite was the primary NOx--N species (>= 50%) in the influent. While in the reactor with low concentration of nitrite (R4: nitrite/nitrate=3:7), Ca. Kuenenia was the dominant AnAOB. This study successfully established a complex and balanced ecosystem with multi-species coexistence, where AnAOB served as the primary functional group on nitrogen removal, supported by denitrification bacteria and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) bacteria. This study proposes a rapid start-up strategy for the anammox process, which overcomes the bottleneck of long start-up time and helps to promote the application of anammox in wastewater treatment.","2023","NOV 2023","10.1016/j.jece.2023.111434","WOS:001123615800001"

Understanding how these systems arise from different components and how the dynamics of microbial interactions allow for species coexistence are fundamental questions in ecology. To address these questions, we built a three-species synthetic community, called BARS (Bacillota A + S + R). Each species in this community exhibits one of three ecological roles: Antagonistic, Sensitive, or Resistant, assigned in the context of a sediment community. We show that the BARS community reproduces features of complex communities and exhibits higher-order interaction (HOI) dynamics. In paired interactions, the majority of the S species (Sutcliffiella horikoshii 20a) population dies within 5 min when paired with the A species (Bacillus pumilus 145). However, an emergent property appears upon adding the third interactor, as antagonism of species A over S is not observed in the presence of the R species (Bacillus cereus 111). For the paired interaction, within the first 5 min, the surviving population of the S species acquires tolerance to species A, and species A ceases antagonism. This qualitative change reflects endogenous dynamics leading to the expression for tolerance to an antagonistic substance. The stability reached in the triple interaction exhibits a nonlinear response, highly sensitive to the density of the R species. In summary, our HOI model allows the study of the assembly dynamics of a three-species community and evaluating the immediate outcome within a 30 min frame. The BARS has features of a complex system where the paired interactions do not predict the community dynamics. The model is amenable to mechanistic dissection and to modeling how the parts integrate to achieve collective properties.","2023",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2023.1057883","WOS:001006343000001"

For sympatric Arisaema species, interspecific gene flow is expected to be effectively prevented by pre-pollination barriers, particularly strong pollinator isolation mediated by fungus gnats. However, due to the lack of quantitative studies combining multiple pre- and post-pollination barriers, it is not known whether pre-pollination isolation is complete, and whether post-pollination barriers also contribute to reproductive isolation among some Arisaema species. In this study, we quantified the individual strengths and absolute contributions of four pre- and post-pollination barriers (phenological isolation, pollinator isolation, hybrid fruit formation, and hybrid seed formation) among three sympatric Arisaema species (A. bockii, A. lobatum, and A. erubescens). Although phenological isolation and pollinator isolation reduced the frequencies of interspecific pollen transfer among these species, the partial overlap of flowering times and pollinator assemblages resulted in incomplete pre-pollination isolation. Post-pollination barriers also contributed to reproductive isolation at the hybrid fruit and seed formation stages. We propose that, although pre-pollination barriers are expected to contribute more to total isolation than post-pollination barriers in Arisaema, pre-pollination barriers may not completely prevent interspecific pollen transfer among some Arisaema species. Post-pollination barriers, which are generally ignored, may also have contributed significantly to reproductive isolation in Arisaema.","2023",NA,"10.1002/ece3.10696","WOS:001095304700001"

However, we lack an understanding of the processes that drive plant diversity and community assembly at different spatial scales. Here, we applied beta-diversity partitioning to test how biotic and abiotic factors are associated with seedling beta-diversity in a tropical montane forest in southern Ecuador. We recorded seedling communities on 81 subplots in nine plots located at three elevations along a 2000 m elevational gradient. We measured biotic pressures (i.e. herbivory and fungal pathogen attacks) and environmental conditions (i.e. soil moisture and canopy closure) in all subplots and related them to species turnover and richness differences in seedling communities within and between elevations. We found that species turnover increased with differences in biotic dissimilarity within elevations, while differences in species richness within elevations increased with increasing environmental dissimilarity. Between elevations, species turnover increased with increasing environmental dissimilarity. Our findings show that species turnover and changes in species richness are related differently to abiotic and biotic factors, and that the importance of these factors for shaping seedling diversity is scale-dependent. Our study contributes to better understand the processes driving seedling beta-diversity and the assembly of plant communities in highly diverse tropical montane forests.","2023","MAY 2023","10.1111/ecog.06538","WOS:000979911000001"

The bioremediation efficiency of this approach is largely determined by the successful colonization of fastidious OHRB, which is highly dependent on the presence of proper growth niches and microbial interactions. In this study, based on two ecological principles (i.e., Priority Effects and Coexistence Theory), three strategies were developed to enhance niche colonization of OHRB, which were tested both in laboratory experiments and field applications: (i) preinoculation of a niche-preparing culture (NPC, being mainly constituted of fermenting bacteria and methanogens); (ii) staggered fermentation; and (iii) increased inoculation of CE40 (a Dehalococcoides-containing tetrachloroethene-to-ethene dechlorinating enrichment culture). Batch experimental results show significantly higher dechlorination efficiencies, as well as lower concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and methane, in experimental sets with staggered fermentation and niche-preconditioning with NPC for 4 days (CE40_NPC-4) relative to control sets. Accordingly, a comparatively higher abundance of Dehalococcoides as major OHRB, together with a lower abundance of fermenting bacteria and methanogens, was observed in CE40_NPC-4 with staggered fermentation, which indicated the balanced syntrophic and competitive interactions between OHRB and other populations for the efficient dechlorination. Further experiments with microbial source tracking analyses suggested enhanced colonization of OHRB by increasing the inoculation ratio of CE40. The optimized conditions for enhanced colonization of OHRB were successfully employed for field bioremediation of trichloroethene (TCE, 0.3-1.4 mM)- and vinyl chloride (VC, similar to 0.04 mM)-contaminated sites, resulting in 96.6% TCE and 99.7% VC dechlorination to ethene within 5 and 3 months, respectively. This study provides ecological principles-guided strategies for efficient bioremediation of chloroethene-contaminated sites, which may be also employed for removal of other emerging organohalide pollutants.","2023","OCT 2023","10.1021/acs.est.3c05932","WOS:001096728100001"
"Sireci, M; Muñoz, MA; Grilli, J","Environmental fluctuations explain the universal decay of species-abundance correlations with phylogenetic distance","PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA","Multiple ecological forces act together to shape the composition of microbial communities. Phyloecology approaches-which combine phylogenetic relationships between species with community ecology-have the potential to disentangle such forces but are often hard to connect with quantitative predictions from theoretical models. On the other hand, macroecology, which focuses on statistical patterns of abundance and diversity, provides natural connections with theoretical models but often neglects interspecific correlations and interactions. Here, we propose a unified framework combining both such approaches to analyze microbial communities. In particular, by using both cross-sectional and longitudinal metagenomic data for species abundances, we reveal the existence of an empirical macroecological law establishing that correlations in species-abundance fluctuations across communities decay from positive to null values as a function of phylogenetic dissimilarity in a consistent manner across ecologically distinct microbiomes. We formulate three variants of a mechanistic model-each relying on alternative ecological forces-that lead to radically different predictions. From these analyses, we conclude that the empirically observed macroecological pattern can be quantitatively explained as a result of shared population-independent fluctuating resources, i.e., environmental filtering and not as a consequence of, e.g., species competition. Finally, we show that the macroecological law is also valid for temporal data of a single community and that the properties of delayed temporal correlations can be reproduced as well by the model with environmental filtering.","2023",NA,"10.1073/pnas.2217144120","WOS:001119304600006"

Thus, REs challenge the basic understanding of how plants adapt to the environment and co-exist with other species. Yet, how REs vary among species in response to species-specific bulk soil nutrient cycling is not well-known. Here, we studied how plant-controlled microbial decomposition activities in rhizosphere soils respond to those in their corresponding bulk soils and whether these relations depend on species-specific nutrient cycling in the bulk soils. We targeted 55 woody species of different clades and mycorrhizal types in three contrasting biomes, namely a temperate forest, a subtropical forest, and a tropical forest. We found that microbial decomposition activities in rhizosphere soils responded linearly to those in their corresponding bulk soils at the species level. Thereafter, we found that REs (parameters in rhizosphere soils minus those in corresponding bulk soils) of microbial decomposition activities had negative linear correlations with microbial decomposition activities in corresponding bulk soils. A multiple factor analysis revealed that soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and soil water content favored bulk soil decomposition activities in all three biomes, showing that the magnitude of REs varied along a fast-slow nutrient cycling spectrum in bulk soils. The species of fast nutrient cycling in their bulk soils tended to have smaller or even negative REs. Therefore, woody plants commonly utilize both positive and negative REs as a nutrient-acquisition strategy. Based on the trade-offs between REs and other nutrient-acquisition strategies, we proposed a push and pull conceptual model which can bring plant nutrient-acquisition cost and plant carbon economics spectrum together in the future. This model will facilitate not only the carbon and nutrient cycling but also the mechanisms of species co-existence in forest ecosystems.","2023","FEB 2023","10.1002/ecy.3981","WOS:000931653300001"
"Dallstream, C; Weemstra, M; Soper, FM","A framework for fine-root trait syndromes: syndrome coexistence may support phosphorus partitioning in tropical forests","OIKOS","Fine roots balance multiple essential plant functions that ultimately fuel plant productivity. The coordination of root functional traits is multidimensional, meaning that some traits are correlated while others can vary independently. This leads to a large variety of adaptive trait combinations and thus functional diversity in plant belowground morphology, anatomy, physiology and symbioses with soil biota. Within forest communities, co-occurrence of such belowground trait combinations may be especially prevalent in tropical forests, not only due to their immense biodiversity but also because their soils are frequently weathered and limited in phosphorus. Phosphorus occurs in different forms (that differ in their mobility and accessibility) that may select for different trait combinations on relatively small spatial scales. While evidence accumulates of the myriad viable nutrient acquisition strategies on poor tropical soils, they are not well conceptualized. In this study, we outline criteria for the identification and investigation of fine-root trait syndromes. We then apply these criteria to a case study of tropical tree species adapted to phosphorus-poor soil and synthesize a range of traits. Five potentially coexisting syndromes are presented that are distinguished by root morphology, mycorrhizal association type, their interactions and implications for fine-root functioning. We connect the functional variation of these species-level syndromes in tropical communities to an established phosphorus partitioning hypothesis. The co-occurrence of fine-root trait syndromes could have implications for root sampling design, species coexistence, community structure and biogeochemical cycling.","2023","MAR 2022","10.1111/oik.08908","WOS:000762655000001"

The model accounts for species mobility via Fickian diffusion, as well as interspecies interactions describing the cyclic competition scheme. The system admits both single-species equilibria (saddles) and a three -species coexistence equilibrium state. We focus on the regime where coexistence is unstable. When there is no spatial dependence, the solution of the corresponding ordinary differential equation (ODE) system admits an attracting heteroclinic cycle consisting of orbits connecting the three single-species saddles in the RPS sequence, to which most solutions with physical initial conditions asymptote. When there is spatial dependence (partial differential equation system), we consider mixed initial conditions (all species cohabit the same spatial region), as well as patch initial conditions, where each species is isolated from the other two, and show that, when interspecies competition is not strong, spatiotemporal chaotic behavior generally occurs. We propose a mechanism for the development of chaos---patch splitting-whereby sufficiently large patches are repeatedly split by the diffusion of competitors into the patch. However, when there is strong interspecies competition, ordered spatiotemporal patterns can occur. We consider both 1D patterns, corresponding to a community confined to a thin, circular annulus, and 2D geometries, simulating a petri dish. We show that, in 1 dimension, traveling arrays of single-species patches, as well as modulated traveling waves, consisting of patches which periodically expand and contract (breather modes), exist. In 2 dimensions, spirals, as well as localized patches chasing each other in the RPS sequence, can occur.

Soil saprobic fungi have important roles in carbon and nutrient cycling in soils, and they are clearly affected by heat events. When tested individually, saprobic soil fungi showed a variety of growth responses to a series of two heat events. However, in nature, these fungi rarely grow alone. Coexistence theory predicts that diversity in the response to stressors can influence the outcome of species interactions and growth. This means that the co-cultivation of different fungi may affect their growth response to heat events. To test if recurring heat events affect fungal growth in small synthetic communities, we evaluated fungi previously known to respond to recurring heat events in experimental small communities composed of two and three species. For the fungi growing in pairs, surprisingly, most of the responses could not be predicted by how the isolates responded individually. In some cases, facilitation or increased competition was observed. For the three fungi growing together, results were also not predicted by the individual or pair responses. Both the heat events and the small communities influenced the growth of the fungi and growth properties emerged from the interactions among isolates and the heat stress. We show that not only do environmental conditions influence fungal interactions and growth rates but also that the co-cultivation of different fungi affects the fungal response to recurring heat events. These results indicate that more complex experimental designs are needed to better understand the effects of recurring heat events and climate change on soil fungi.","2023",NA,"10.3389/fevo.2022.1028136","WOS:000936129300001"
"George, AB; Korolev, KS","Ecological landscapes guide the assembly of optimal microbial communities","PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY","Author summaryResearch shows that microbial communities comprised of specific species combinations can cure disease, improve agricultural output, or synthesize valuable chemicals. But finding the species combinations that generate high-performing communities is challenging because there are too many species combinations to test exhaustively. So, scientists use heuristic strategies that test only a few species combinations to search for high-performing communities. However, these heuristic strategies often fail to find the best species combinations, and we still do not understand when they fail. Here, we develop a framework to analyze these heuristic strategies, building on the concept of fitness landscapes studied in evolution and computer science. We apply this framework to data from simulated microbial community models to identify biological properties that affect the success of heuristic search strategies, such as the extent to which microbes compete for the same metabolites. Further, we establish statistical measures of the landscape structure that can help estimate search success from preliminary data. We validate our findings using experimental data from communities of soil microbes. Together, our results develop a conceptual framework to analyze and develop heuristic search strategies and identify guiding principles to help scientists choose species and environmental conditions that make finding high-performing microbial communities easier. Assembling optimal microbial communities is key for various applications in biofuel production, agriculture, and human health. Finding the optimal community is challenging because the number of possible communities grows exponentially with the number of species, and so an exhaustive search cannot be performed even for a dozen species. A heuristic search that improves community function by adding or removing one species at a time is more practical, but it is unknown whether this strategy can discover an optimal or nearly optimal community. Using consumer-resource models with and without cross-feeding, we investigate how the efficacy of search depends on the distribution of resources, niche overlap, cross-feeding, and other aspects of community ecology. We show that search efficacy is determined by the ruggedness of the appropriately-defined ecological landscape. We identify specific ruggedness measures that are both predictive of search performance and robust to noise and low sampling density. The feasibility of our approach is demonstrated using experimental data from a soil microbial community. Overall, our results establish the conditions necessary for the success of the heuristic search and provide concrete design principles for building high-performing microbial consortia.","2023",NA,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010570","WOS:000937153000001"

However, the mechanisms associated with maintenance of the diversity of nirK bacterial commu-nities in agro-ecosystems are unclear. In particular, the ecological roles of generalists and specialists in nirK bacterial communities under different soil organic carbon (SOC) levels have not been characterized. In this study, we divided 102 soil samples (0-20 and 20-40 cm) from 62 apple orchards in China's main apple producing areas (Shaanxi and Shandong provinces) into four groups according to the SOC content and soil depth, i.e., high organic carbon soils in the 0-20 cm depth, low organic carbon soils in the 0-20 cm depth, high organic carbon soils in the 20-40 cm depth, and low organic carbon soils in the 20-40 cm depth. In the nirK bacterial com-munity, 4187 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (-51.32 %) were classified as specialists and 1781 OTUs (-21.83 %) as generalists. The alpha-diversity of generalists was higher in the high SOC soils than the low SOC soils, which was consistent with the alpha-diversity of the whole nirK bacterial community. However, the observed number of specialist species was lower in high SOC soils than low SOC soils. Analysis based on the Spearman's correlation coefficients also showed that the alpha-diversity and relative abundances of generalists and specialists responded differently to environmental factors. Both deterministic and stochastic processes contributed to the assembly of generalists and specialists. Among the deterministic processes, variable selection was important for the assembly of the generalist community, whereas homogeneous selection was important for the assembly of the specialist community. The niche breadth of generalists was higher than that of specialists, whereas the niche overlap of specialists was higher than that of generalists. The niche breadth of generalists was higher in high SOC soils than low SOC soils. In both networks, generalists had higher degrees than specialists, although the number of gen-eralists was much lower than that of specialists. Our findings demonstrate the contributions of generalists and specialists to the changes in the diversity of the nirK bacterial community at different SOC levels as well as providing new insights into the mechanisms responsible for maintaining the diversity of the nirK bacterial community.","2023","OCT 2022","10.1016/j.apsoil.2022.104713","WOS:000882360600005"

We mapped 0- to 50-cm Babassu and Urochloa root profiles at three distances representing contrasting relative dominance: within clusters (0.4-0.6 m from adult palm, Babassu-dominated), close (2.5-4.0 m), and far (>8.0-10.0 m, Urochloa-dominated). Total Babassu root share count was 76.0% within Babassu clusters, as opposed to Urochloa root share count (80.0%) far from clusters, confirming our experimental dominance gradient. Babassu and Urochloa root diameter composition differed strongly, whereas 44.6% of all Babassu roots were mid-diameter or coarse; 83.0% of all Urochloa roots were fine graminoid. Vertical root profiles likewise differed: Babassu coarse and mid-diameter roots concentrated within clusters at 20-50 cm depth, well protected against disturbance, though Babassu mid-diameter roots did extend up to 10 m, indicating active foraging at long distances. By contrast, Urochloa mid-diameter and coarse roots concentrated in the topsoil (70.4% in top 20 cm). Notably, 45.0% of all Urochloa fine roots but only 29.3% of deeper rooting Babassu concentrated in the top 0-10 cm.

Fine-root fine-scale variability was high, with high-density hotspots of both species in the topsoil. Babassu vertical root profiles were unaffected by the degree of interspecific competitive confrontation, whereas Urochloa fine roots were significantly shallower within than outside of Babassu clusters. Though differing Babassu and Urochloa vertical root profiles do support the notion of niche expansion caused by Babassu clusters within the vast Urochloa pastures throughout Amazonia, we also find a strong horizontal and vertical niche overlap with no indication of fine-scale root segregation, indicating direct competition between both species, possibly in a dynamic state of mutual invasability.

Here, we applied a top-down microbial community management approach by inhibiting SRB to elucidate their contributions to the microbial community during OM degradation. Based on the highly replicated microcosms (n = 20) of five different incubation stages, we found that many microbial community properties were influenced after inhibiting SRB, including the composition, structure, network, and community assembly processes. We also found a strong coexistence pattern between SRB and other abundant phylogenetic lineages via positive frequency-dependent selection. The relative abundances of the families Synergistaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, Dethiosulfatibacteraceae, Prolixibacteraceae, Marinilabiliaceae, and Marinifilaceae were simultaneously suppressed after inhibiting SRB during OM degradation. A close association between SRB and the order Marinilabiliales among coexisting taxa was most prominent. They contributed to preserved modules during network successions, were keystone nodes mediating the networked community, and contributed to homogeneous ecological selection. The molybdate tolerance test of the isolated strains of Marinilabiliales showed that inhibited SRB (not the inhibitor of SRB itself) triggered a decrease in the relative abundance of Marinilabiliales. We also found that inhibiting SRB resulted in reduced pH, which is unsuitable for the growth of most Marinilabiliales strains, while the addition of pH buffer (HEPES) in SRB-inhibited treatment microcosms restored the pH and the relative abundances of these bacteria. These data supported that SRB could modify niches to affect species coexistence.IMPORTANCE Our model offers insight into the ecological properties of SRB and identifies a previously undocumented dimension of OM degradation.

Among the proposed mechanisms, negative density dependence theory (NDD) predicts that seedling growth rate declines at high conspecific densities. However, local environmental conditions and seasonality may also modulate the strength of NDD. We used data from dry and wet seasons in West African semi-arid savannas to explore the importance of NDD and environmental heterogeneity in predicting seedling growth of Afzelia africana Sm, a threatened species with high economic and cutural values. First, we analysed variation of seedling growth in dry and wet seasons, and between vegetation types (tree and shrub savannas). Next, we assessed the effects of environmental heterogeneity (soil type, slope and elevation) and biotic factors (conspecific/heterospecific seedling and adult densities, leaf fungal infection, herbivory) on seedling growth in dry and wet seasons, while controlling for initial seedling size. We predicted that seedling growth would be higher in the wet than in the dry season, and in shrub savannas than in tree savannas due to variation in stand density and intensity of competitive biotic interactions. We also hypothesized that slope and negative density dependence would influence seedling growth and that, the density-dependent effects would vary with environmental heterogeneity and seasonality. Results showed two distinct patterns of seedling growth primarily driven by seasonality: a higher growth rate in the wet season due to water availability and a smaller growth rate during the dry season, possibly because seedlings develop adaptation to drought and fire at the expense of their growth. Growth rate was also higher on flat and gentle slope. Density-dependent effects on seedling growth were only observed with conspecific adults. Seasonality modulated the strength of the density-dependent effect, which was significantly negative in the wet season and nonsignificant in the dry season. This study suggests that A. africana early seedling growth is modulated by interacting effects of seasonality, terrain slope and adult conspecific density. Campaigns for reforestation with A. africana in the semi-arid areas will require increased attention on the seedlings during the long periods of drought.","2023","APR 2023","10.1016/j.gecco.2023.e02455","WOS:001041621700001"

Nitrogen addition and pathogen suppression modified species interaction strengths and intrinsic growth rates, leading to reduced multispecies fitness differences. However, contrary to expected, we also observed that they promote stabilising niche differences. Although these modifications did not substantially alter species richness, they predicted major changes in community composition. Indirect interactions between species explained these community changes in smaller assemblages (three and four species) but lost importance in favour of direct pairwise interactions when more species were involved (five and six). Altogether, our work shows that explicitly considering the number of interacting species is critical for better understanding the direct and indirect processes by which nitrogen enrichment and pathogen communities shape coexistence in grasslands.","2023","JAN 2023","10.1111/nph.18689","WOS:000906985500001"

Effects of AMF on coexistence were determined by parametrizing pair-wise Lotka-Volterra plant competition models. Responses of the six plant species to AMF were determined by comparing the shoot biomass of single plants grown in the absence of any competition with AMF to the shoot biomass without AMF. The inoculation with AMF reduced the fitness differences between competitors, but the degree of AMF-mediated coexistence depended on the identity of the competing plant species. A greater AMF response difference between competing plant species reduced niche overlap and increased coexistence. These results show that while AMF generally reduce fitness differences, the equalizing effect of AMF is not always strong enough to overcome a competitive imbalance due to niche overlap and thus does not always lead to coexistence. Instead, it is the intrinsic growth response of different plant species to AMF, which can predict reduced niche overlap that in turn leads to coexistence. This implies that mycorrhizal dependence is a plant strategy to reduce niche overlap with competitors, thus allowing for greater coexistence.","2023",NA,"10.1093/jpe/rtac081","WOS:000935768600003"

To compare multiple mechanisms, we modeled a two-trophic planktonic food web based on mechanistic species interactions and empirically measured species traits. We simulated thousands of possible communities under realistic and altered interaction strengths to assess the relative importance of three potential drivers of phytoplankton and zooplankton species richness: resource-mediated coexistence mechanisms, predator-prey interactions, and trait trade-offs. Next, we computed niche and fitness differences of competing zooplankton to obtain a deeper understanding of how these mechanisms determine species richness. We found that predator-prey interactions were the most important driver of phytoplankton and zooplankton species richness and that large zooplankton fitness differences were associated with low species richness, but zooplankton niche differences were not associated with species richness. However, for many communities we could not apply modern coexistence theory to compute niche and fitness differences of zooplankton because of conceptual issues with the invasion growth rates arising from trophic interactions. We therefore need to expand modern coexistence theory to fully investigate multitrophic-level communities.","2023","JUL 2023","10.1086/724660","WOS:000991717400001"

A major question is how broadly distributed generalist taxa, and limitedly distributed specialist taxa, vary across a latitudinal gradient in freshwater ecosystems. We predict that: (a) generalists and specialists exhibit latitudinal diversity gradient with different patterns; (b) their community assemblies are mainly driven by stochastic processes; and (c) generalists coexist through niche differences, while specialists coexist through fitness differences. Location: Sixty lakes and reservoirs in China, ranging from 18 degrees N to 50 degrees N. ime Period: July-August in 2012 and 2018. Taxa Studied: Bacterioplankton. Methods: We clustered zero-radius operational taxonomic unit (zOTU) (subspecies-like level) into operational taxonomic unit (OTU) (species-like level) and calculated the intra-specific variation and spatial asynchrony of OTU. We examined the relative effects of environment versus space (latitude) on bacterial community and quantified the community assembly processes of generalists and specialists, respectively. The binary-state speciation and extinction (BiSSE) model has been used to estimate the evolutionary characteristics. The abundances of the top zOTUs within each OTU were identified to reveal their niche preferences (distribution patterns at different sites). Results: We found that bacterial generalists had a higher intra-specific variation, greater asynchrony and wider niche width than the specialists. With increasing latitude, bacterial diversity decreased with abundance variations in generalists and occurrence variations in specialists, respectively. Diversification in stochastic processes was the main driving factor in both groups, though deterministic processes showed greater effects on specialists than generalists in local communities. Bacterial generalists coexisted through niche differences, whereas specialists coexisted through average fitness differences. Main Conclusions: We demonstrated distinct latitudinal distribution patterns of bacterial generalists and specialists. These results highlight differences in biogeography of microbial generalist and specialist taxa mediated by intra-specific variation and emphasize their distinctly vital roles mediated by differing mechanisms in freshwater ecosystems.","2023","SEP 2023","10.1111/geb.13751","WOS:001069980400001"
"Ke, PJ; Wan, J","A general approach for quantifying microbial effects on plant competition","PLANT AND SOIL","Purpose A growing perspective in plant ecology highlights the ways that microbial interactions can promote or hinder plant coexistence. Towards this aim, recently-proposed approaches provide ways to empirically quantify how microbes affect the outcome of competition between plants. One such approach experimentally measures competition coefficients by comparing biomass performance of plants growing individually or with competitors, then quantifies microbial effects by comparing with a sterilization treatment. Nonetheless, the complexity of plant-microbe interactions presents general challenges when linking observations of microbial effects to underlying models. Methods Building on insights from modern coexistence theory, we propose a comprehensive density gradient design to quantify the combined impact of plant-plant competition and plant-soil microbe interactions on plant coexistence patterns. Results We show how the implementation of a density gradient design can help quantify potential nonlinearities and facilitative interactions in plant-soil microbe interactions, which are properties once thought to hinder the quantification of the microbial impact of plant competitive outcome. We provide guidelines for setting up the experiment and accurately interpreting the results. Conclusion We argue that future studies should aim to parameterize suitable demographic models to characterize the contribution of soil microbes to plant coexistence.","2023","OCT 2022","10.1007/s11104-022-05744-3","WOS:000873349900002"

Previous NDD related studies usually correlated seedling survival to the density of host-specific pests or pathogens along the physical distance to conspecific neighbors, and molecular defense responses of focal seedlings to natural enemies were seldom concerned. By employing a community functional genomic strategy, we extracted copy numbers of homologous genes in defense responses from transcriptomic data of 99 tree species and their inherent impacts on seedling survival were evaluated using linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) and general linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs). The copy number of fungus-defense, insect-defense, and virus-defense genes showed significant negative correlations with survival rates of the seedling community and the copy number of insect-defense genes significantly and negatively correlated with survival rates of top-twenty common species. Seedlings tended to have high survival rates when surrounded by seedling neighbors with similar insectdefense CNV matrices and adult neighbors with distinct bacterium-defense and virus-defense CNV matrices.We conclude that both gene copy number and dissimilarities to adult and seedling neighbors in defense response to natural enemies contributed to seedling survival, indicating the critical contributions of molecular defense responses of plants to species coexistence and diversity maintenance in subtropical forests.","2023","JUN 2023","10.1016/j.foreco.2023.121191","WOS:001032328200001"

In yeast, researchers have investigated these effects for knock-out or other large-effect mutations, but have not accounted for differences at the mating-type locus. We set out to compare fitness differences among strains that differ in ploidy and/or zygosity using a panel of spontaneously arising mutations acquired in haploid yeast from a previous study. To ensure no genetic differences, even at the mating-type locus, we embarked on a series of transformations, which first sterilized and then temporarily introduced plasmid-borne mating types. Despite these attempts to equalize the haplotypes, fitness variation introduced during transformation swamped the differences among the original mutation-accumulation lines. While colony size looked normal, we observed a bi-modality in the maximum growth rate of our transformed yeast and determined that many of the slow growing lines were respiratory deficient (petite). Not previously reported, we found that yeast that were TID1/RDH54 knockouts were less likely to become petite. Even for lines with the same petite status, however, we found no correlation in fitness between the two replicate transformations performed. These results pose a challenge for any study using transformation to measure the fitness effect of genetic differences among strains. By attempting to hold haplotypes constant, we introduced more mutations that overwhelmed our ability to measure fitness differences between the genetic states. In this study, we transformed over one hundred different lines of yeast, using two independent transformations, and found that this common laboratory procedure can cause large changes to the microbe studied. Our study provides a cautionary tale of the need to use multiple transformants in fitness assays.","2023",NA,"10.7717/peerj.16547","WOS:001123165400001"

It remains unclear whether Zika virus evolved to become more transmissible directly before or during the epidemic. To investigate whether Zika evolved to become more transmissible, we engineered a library of recombinant viruses that represent twelve major Zika virus lineages that circulated throughout the Americas. We measured the replicative fitness of each of these lineages by infecting live mosquitoes and human cells that are relevant for disease or transmission. We found that two of the lineages, one that dominated Central America and another that existed mostly in the Caribbean, appear to replicate more efficiently in human cells. While the fitness changes do not appear to have significant effects on the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic, our analysis suggests Zika virus evolved at least twice during this outbreak. Monitoring the phenotypic evolution during the course of an outbreak can help control spread and mitigate disease. We believe this framework can be applied to study phenotypic evolution during future epidemics caused by emerging RNA viruses. RNA viruses have short generation times and high mutation rates, allowing them to undergo rapid molecular evolution during epidemics. However, the extent of RNA virus phenotypic evolution within epidemics and the resulting effects on fitness and virulence remain mostly unknown. Here, we screened the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic in the Americas for lineage-specific fitness differences. We engineered a library of recombinant viruses representing twelve major Zika virus lineages and used them to measure replicative fitness within disease-relevant human primary cells and live mosquitoes. We found that two of these lineages conferred significant in vitro replicative fitness changes among human primary cells, but we did not find fitness changes in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Additionally, we found evidence for elevated levels of positive selection among five amino acid sites that define major Zika virus lineages. While our work suggests that Zika virus may have acquired several phenotypic changes during a short time scale, these changes were relatively moderate and do not appear to have enhanced transmission during the epidemic.","2023",NA,"10.1371/journal.pntd.0011055","WOS:000966649800001"

Although theory predicts that fluctuations in environments can facilitate diversity maintenance, the effects of fluctuating temperature on species diversity have rarely been investigated in species-rich microbial communities. Here, we examined whether fluctuating temperature had positive effects on species diversity relative to constant temperatures in soil bacterial communities, and investigated the effects of fluctuating temperature on bacterial performances (changes in relative abundance). We performed a temperature manipulation experiment with soils collected from temperate and subtropical zones, where the soils were subjected to constant high, low or fluctuating temperatures. We found that fluctuating temperatures showed significant positive effects on species diversity. The time-averaged effect of fluctuating temperatures (i.e., averaging out the differences between species in their environment-dependent performances) appeared to delay species loss in both the temperate and the subtropical communities. In addition, we found that the performances of temperature-responsive species at fluctuating temperatures significantly deviated from their time-weighted average performances at constant high and low temperatures, which was defined as fluctuation-dependent effects in our study. Intriguingly, fluctuation-dependent effects beyond time-averaged effect led to an opposite trend: differences in temperature-responsive species' performances decreased in the temperate communities, but increased in the subtropical communities. Our findings provide new insights into diversity maintenance in soil bacterial communities, and imply that the effects of fluctuating temperature on species diversity in soil bacterial community might vary across latitude.","2023","APR 2023","10.1111/mec.16937","WOS:000961356100001"

"Rothschild, J; Ma, TY; Milstein, JN; Zilman, A","Spatial exclusion leads to tug-of-war ecological dynamics between competing species within microchannels","PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY","Competition is ubiquitous in microbial communities, shaping both their spatial and temporal structure and composition. Classical minimal models of competition, such as the Moran model, have been employed in ecology and evolutionary biology to understand the role of fixation and invasion in the maintenance of population diversity. Informed by recent experimental studies of cellular competition in confined spaces, we extend the Moran model to incorporate mechanical interactions between cells that divide within the limited space of a one-dimensional open microchannel. The model characterizes the skewed collective growth of the cells dividing within the channel, causing cells to be expelled at the channel ends. The results of this spatial exclusion model differ significantly from those of its classical well-mixed counterpart. The mean time to fixation of a species is greatly accelerated, scaling logarithmically, rather than algebraically, with the system size, and fixation/extinction probability sharply depends on the species' initial fractional abundance. By contrast, successful takeovers by invasive species, whether through mutation or immigration, are substantially less likely than in the Moran model. We also find that the spatial exclusion tends to attenuate the effects of fitness differences on the fixation times and probabilities. We find that these effects arise from the combination of the quasi-neutral tug-of-war diffusion dynamics of the inter-species boundary around an unstable equipoise point and the quasi-deterministic avalanche dynamics away from the fixed point. These results, which can be tested in microfluidic monolayer devices, have implications for the maintenance of species diversity in dense bacterial and cellular ecosystems where spatial exclusion is central to the competition, such as in organized biofilms or intestinal crypts. Competition for territory between different species has far reaching consequences for the diversity and fate of bacterial and other ecological communities. In this study, we theoretically and computationally study the competitive dynamics of two bacterial populations competing for space in one-dimensional confined environments, extending classical models that serve as paradigms for competitive dynamics but do not explicitly include spatial exclusion. We find that spatial effects can drastically change the population outcomes by changing the probabilities that one species excludes the other from the environment the mean times to such exclusion. In comparison to the predictions of population models that neglect spatial aspects of the competition, species with higher relative fitness differences are less heavily favoured to outcompete their rival species. Spatial exclusion also changes the system stability with respect to invasion: there is a reduction in the effectiveness of invader's ability to take over the population. Our results show that spatial exclusion has rich and repercussions on species dominance and the long-time composition of populations. These must be considered when trying to understand complex bacterial ecosystems such as biofilms and intestinal flora.","2023",NA,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010868","WOS:001113296800003"

While many factors may contribute to their rarity, we lack methods for estimating the extent to which they constrain the appearance of a prokaryotic endosymbiosis. Here, we address this knowledge gap by examining the role of metabolic compatibility between a prokaryotic host and endosymbiont. We use genome-scale metabolic flux models from three different collections (AGORA, KBase, and CarveMe) to assess the viability, fitness, and evolvability of potential prokaryotic endosymbioses. We find that while more than half of host-endosymbiont pairings are metabolically viable, the resulting endosymbioses have reduced growth rates compared to their ancestral metabolisms and are unlikely to gain mutations to overcome these fitness differences. In spite of these challenges, we do find that they may be more robust in the face of environmental perturbations at least in comparison with the ancestral host metabolism lineages.

Host-pathogen-like interactions drive the community into a spatiotemporally chaotic state characterized by continual, spatially-local, blooms and busts. Upon the slow serial introduction of new strains, the community diversifies indefinitely, accommodating an arbitrarily large number of strains in spite of the absence of stabilizing niche interactions. The diversifying phase persists - albeit with gradually slowing diversification - in the presence of general, nonspecific, fitness differences between strains, which break the assumption of tradeoffs inherent in much previous work. Building on a dynamical-mean field-theory analysis of the ecological dynamics, an approximate effective model captures the evolution of the diversity and distributions of key properties.

High-affinity antibodies to pathogens such as HIV, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2 are frequently reported to arise from B cells whose receptors, the precursors to antibodies, are encoded by particular immunoglobulin alleles. This raises the possibility that the presence of particular germline alleles in the B cell repertoire is a major determinant of the quality of the antibody response. Alternatively, initial differences in germline alleles' propensities to form high-affinity receptors might be overcome by chance events during affinity maturation. We first investigate these scenarios in simulations: when germline-encoded fitness differences are large relative to the rate and effect size variation of somatic mutations, the same germline alleles persistently dominate the response of different individuals. In contrast, if germline-encoded advantages can be easily overcome by subsequent mutations, allele usage becomes increasingly divergent over time, a pattern we then observe in mice experimentally infected with influenza virus. We investigated whether affinity maturation might nonetheless strongly select for particular amino acid motifs across diverse genetic backgrounds, but we found no evidence of convergence to similar CDR3 sequences or amino acid substitutions. These results suggest that although germline-encoded specificities can lead to similar immune responses between individuals, diverse evolutionary routes to high affinity limit the genetic predictability of responses to infection and vaccination.","2023",NA,"10.1371/journal.ppat.1011603","WOS:001126644300005"

The limitation of resources is expected to drive bacterial competition resulting in exclusion or coexistence based on fitness differences and resource overlap between individual colonisers. We studied the impact of resource competition by determining the effects of different bacterial colonisers on the growth of the model epiphyte Pantoea eucalypti 299R (Pe299R). Resource overlap was predicted based on genome-scale metabolic modelling. By combining results of metabolic modelling and pairwise competitions in the Arabidopsis thaliana phyllosphere and in vitro, we found that ten resources sufficed to explain fitness of Pe299R. An effect of both resource overlap and phylogenetic relationships was found on competition outcomes in vitro as well as in the phyllosphere. However, effects of resource competition were much weaker in the phyllosphere when compared to in vitro experiments. When investigating growth dynamics and reproductive success at the single-cell resolution, resource overlap and phylogenetic relationships are only weakly correlated with epiphytic Pe299R reproductive success, indicating that the leaf's spatial heterogeneity mitigates resource competition. Although the correlation is weak, the presence of competitors led to the development of Pe299R subpopulations that experienced different life histories and cell divisions. In some in planta competitions, Pe299R benefitted from the presence of epiphytes despite high resource overlap to the competitor strain suggesting other factors having stronger effects than resource competition.

Ectotherms are usually characterized by a hump-shaped relationship between fitness and temperature, a non-linear reaction norm that is referred to as thermal performance curve (TPC). To understand and predict impacts of global change, we need to know whether and how such TPCs evolve. Therefore, we performed a systematic literature search and a statistical meta-analysis focusing on experimental evolution and artificial selection studies. This focus allows us to directly quantify relative fitness responses to temperature selection by calculating fitness differences between TPCs from ancestral and derived populations after thermal selection. Out of 7561 publications screened, we found 47 studies corresponding to our search criteria representing taxa across the tree of life, from bacteria, to plants and vertebrates. We show that, independently of species identity, the studies we found report a positive response to temperature selection. Considering entire TPC shapes, adaptation to higher temperatures traded off with fitness at lower temperatures, leading to niche shifts. Effects were generally stronger in unicellular organisms. By contrast, we do not find statistical support for the often discussed Hotter is better hypothesis.

Modern coexistence theory (MCT) identifies coexistence mechanisms, one of which, storage effects, hinges on relationships between fluctuations in environmental and competitive pressures. However, such relationships are typically measured using covariance, which does not account for the possibility that environment and competition may be more related to each other when they are strong than when weak, or vice versa. Recent work showed that such 'asymmetric tail associations' (ATAs) are common between ecological variables, and are important for extinction risk, ecosystem stability, and other phenomena. We extend MCT, decomposing storage effects to show the influence of ATAs. Analysis of a simple model and an empirical example using diatoms illustrate that ATA influences can be comparable in magnitude to other mechanisms of coexistence and that ATAs can make the difference between species coexistence and competitive exclusion. ATA influences may be an important new mechanism of coexistence. Influences of asymmetries of association between environment and competition are taken into account for their effects on coexistence versus competitive exclusion of competing species.

Some functional groups that solely use CO2 for photosynthesis could receive competitive advantages from the predicted increase in CO2 compared to groups with efficient carbon acquisition strategies of HCO3-. The aim of this study was to identify carbon use strategies in the common macrophytes (macroalgae, charophytes, seagrass, and other angiosperms) that represent a broad range of functional traits to CO2 concentrations in the northeastern Baltic Sea. Mechanistic assessment of the carbon physiology of macrophytes was used to predict productivity and competitive interactions between different functional groups under future climate. Carbon use strategies in macrophytes were determined by analysing the carbon isotopes (& delta;C-13), pH drift experiments, and photosynthesis versus dissolved inorganic carbon. In addition, habitat mapping data was used to interpret the potential implications of the elevated CO2 to this coastal ecosystem. The results suggested that the primary productivity of macrophytes is often limited by carbon availability, and the increasing CO2 concentrations in the brackish Baltic Sea are expected to enhance photosynthetic production. While all species tested showed evidence of carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs), differential levels of CCM activity indicate varying levels of competitive fitness in a future high-CO2 environment. Overall, macrophytes which inhabit the shallowest and deepest parts of the vegetated zone are expected to experience physiological benefits under future CO2 conditions, while intermediate communities dominated by the perennial brown alga Fucus vesiculosus may experience loss of fitness. These fitness differences have implications for competitive interaction and species range under future climate.","2023","AUG 2023","10.1007/s10811-023-03047-3","WOS:001046952400003"

Here we establish a common garden approach to study causal ecological interactions between a xenogeneic conditional lethal sacB gene and the community of transposable insertion sequences (ISs) in a multipartite prokaryote genome. Xenogeneic sacB of low, medium, or high GC content was individually inserted into three replicons of a model bacterium Sinorhizobium fredii, and exhibited replicon- and GC-dependent variation in genetic stability. This variation was largely attributable to multidimensional niche differentiation for IS community members. The transposition efficiency of major active ISs depended on the nucleoid-associated xenogeneic silencer MucR. Experimentally eliminating insertion activity of specific ISs by deleting MucR strongly demonstrated a dominant role of niche differentiation among ISs. This intracellular common garden approach in the experimental evolution context allows not only for evaluating genetic stability of natural and synthetic xenogeneic genes of different sequence signatures in host cells but also for tracking and testing causal relationships in unifying ecological principles in genome ecology.","2023","NOV 2022","10.1038/s41396-022-01344-2","WOS:000888688700001"

Putatively autotrophic methanogenic archaea have been identified in the subsurface waters of the Samail Ophiolite, Sultanate of Oman, though the strategies to overcome hyperalkaline pH and dissolved inorganic carbon limitation remain to be fully understood. Here, we recovered metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) and applied a metapangenomic approach to three different Methanobacterium populations to assess habitat-specific functional gene distribution. A Type I population was identified in the fluids with neutral pH, while a Type II and Mixed population were identified in the most hyperalkaline fluids (pH 11.63). The core genome of all Methanobacterium populations highlighted potential DNA scavenging techniques to overcome phosphate or nitrogen limitation induced by environmental conditions. With particular emphasis on the Mixed and Type II population found in the most hyperalkaline fluids, the accessory genomes unique to each population reflected adaptation mechanisms suggesting lifestyles that minimize niche overlap. In addition to previously reported metabolic capability to utilize formate as an electron donor and generate intracellular CO2, the Type II population possessed genes relevant to defense against antimicrobials and assimilating potential osmoprotectants to provide cellular stability. The accessory genome of the Mixed population was enriched in genes for multiple glycosyltransferases suggesting reduced energetic costs by adhering to mineral surfaces or to other microorganisms, and fostering a non-motile lifestyle. These results highlight the niche differentiation of distinct Methanobacterium populations to circumvent the challenges of serpentinization impacted fluids through coexistence strategies, supporting our ability to understand controls on methanogenic lifestyles and adaptations within the serpentinizing subsurface fluids of the Samail Ophiolite.","2023",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2023.1205558","WOS:001026228900001"

At the early stage of degradation in the alpine meadow, aboveground net primary productivity decreased, while belowground net primary productivity increased. As a result, the total net primary productivity was unchanged at the early stage of degradation. Both aboveground and belowground net primary productivity significantly decreased at the late stage of degradation compared with the non-degraded meadows. Plants and microorganisms mainly absorbed inorganic N and preferred NH4+ at the non-degraded meadows where available soil N (the total concentration of exchangeable NH4+, NO3-, and dissolved organic N) was maintained at a high level of 60.9 mu g N g(-1) dry soil, indicating an N-use chemical niche overlap. Plants and microorganisms showed a niche differentiation at the early stage of degradation where available soil N decreased to a medium level of 44.6 mu g N g(-1) dry soil; plants preferred NO3-, while microorganisms took up more NH4+. In contrast, microorganisms increased their uptake of organic N, while plants assimilated more inorganic N, indicating that plants and microorganisms showed a niche differentiation where available soil N decreased to a low level of 26.6 mu g N g(-1) dry soil at the late stage of degradation. The higher N uptake (30% increase of N uptake compared with non-degraded meadows) of dominant plant species and niche differentiation in using available soil N between plants and microorganisms are two mechanisms maintaining the total community net primary productivity, even when available soil N decreased at the early stage of degradation. Plants and microorganisms also showed a niche differentiation when available N declined further at the late stage of degradation. However, the N uptake by dominant plant species greatly declined at the late stage of degradation (76% reduction of N uptake compared with non-degraded meadows), which might explain the community net primary productivity reduction (78% lower compared with non-degraded meadows).","2023","NOV 2022","10.1007/s00374-022-01679-0","WOS:000880512200001"

However, the effects of nanoparticles on species interactions, and the role of species traits, such as body size, in modulating these effects, are not well-understood. We addressed this issue using competing freshwater phytoplankton species exposed to copper oxide nanoparticles. Increasing nanoparticle concentration resulted in decreased phytoplankton species growth rates and community productivity (both abundance and biomass). Importantly, we consistently found that nanoparticles had greater negative effects on species with smaller cell sizes, such that nanoparticle pollution weakened the competitive dominance of smaller species and promoted species diversity. Moreover, nanoparticles reduced the growth rate differences and competitive ability differences of competing species, while having little effect on species niche differences. Consequently, nanoparticle pollution reduced the selection effect on phytoplankton community abundance, but increased the selection effect on community biomass. Our results suggest cell size as a key functional trait to consider when predicting phytoplankton community structure and ecosystem functioning in the face of increasing nanopollution.

While fitness and antigenic structure are both important aspects of virus success, they are distinct characteristics and do not always change in a complementary manner. The 2019-2020 Northern Hemisphere influenza season saw the emergence of two H1N1 clades: A5a.1 and A5a.2. While several studies indicated that A5a.2 showed similar or even increased antigenic drift compared with A5a.1, the A5a.1 clade was still the predominant circulating clade that season. Clinical isolates of representative viruses from these clades were collected in Baltimore, Maryland during the 2019-2020 season and multiple assays were performed to compare both antigenic drift and viral fitness between clades. Neutralization assays performed on serum from healthcare workers pre- and post-vaccination during the 2019-2020 season show a comparable drop in neutralizing titers against both A5a.1 and A5a.2 viruses compared with the vaccine strain, indicating that A5a.1 did not have antigenic advantages over A5a.2 that would explain its predominance in this population. Plaque assays were performed to investigate fitness differences, and the A5a.2 virus produced significantly smaller plaques compared with viruses from A5a.1 or the parental A5a clade. To assess viral replication, low MOI growth curves were performed on both MDCK-SIAT and primary differentiated human nasal epithelial cell cultures. In both cell cultures, A5a.2 yielded significantly reduced viral titers at multiple timepoints post-infection compared with A5a.1 or A5a. Receptor binding was then investigated through glycan array experiments which showed a reduction in receptor binding diversity for A5a.2, with fewer glycans bound and a higher percentage of total binding attributable to the top three highest bound glycans. Together these data indicate that the A5a.2 clade had a reduction in viral fitness, including reductions in receptor binding, that may have contributed to the limited prevalence observed after emergence.","2023",NA,"10.1038/s41598-023-37122-z","WOS:001018745700026"

Newly discovered comammox Nitrospira and canonical nitrifiers (ammonia-oxidizing archaea and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria) collaboratively perform the oxidation of ammonia in ecosystems. However, the niche distribution of three ammonia oxidizers is controversial. In this study, we explored the distribution and diversity of comammox Nitrospira in riparian wetland ecosystems around Taihu Lake.Materials and methodsSoil samples were collected from five habitats: wheat field, vegetable field, peach orchard, tea orchard, and small camphor forest. The abundances and diversity of comammox Nitrospira amoA gene were measured.Results and discussionThe amoA gene abundance of comammox Nitrospira varied greatly, ranging from 1.83 x 10(5) to 8.35 x 10(7) copies/g. Temperature, total nitrogen, total carbon, and pH showed significant correlations with the amoA gene abundance of three ammonia oxidizers. High-throughput sequencing suggested that the community structure of comammox Nitrospira showed both spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Total carbon and pH could be the prime environmental factors causing the niche differentiation between comammox Nitrospira and canonical nitrifiers. Moisture content and NH4+ affected the community structure of comammox Nitrospira.ConclusionsThree ammonia oxidizers distributed widely in riparian wetland ecosystems around Taihu Lake. Canonical nitrifiers were more competitive than comammox Nitrospira in most soil samples. Meanwhile, comammox Nitrospira seemed to prefer inhabiting oligotrophic conditions.

Estimates of differentiation in relation to different niche types were only moderately correlated. However, coexisting taxon niches were consistently less differentiated than expected, based on a regional null model, indicating the importance of habitat filtering at that scale. Nonetheless, resource niches were relatively more differentiated than condition niches, which is consistent with the effect of a resource niche-based coexistence mechanism.

We investigated the influence of soil age, water availability (wet and dry), and plant species (native Microlaena stipoides and exotic Trifolium subterraneum) on anatomical root colonisation and DNA profiles of M-AMF and G-AMF under glasshouse conditions. We grew seedlings of each species in soils collected from the four stages of a soil chronosequence, where pH decreases from the youngest to oldest stages, and phosphorus (P) is low in the youngest and oldest, but high in the intermediate stages. We scored the percentage of root length colonised and used DNA metabarcoding to profile fungal richness and community composition associated with treatment combinations. Soil age, water availability, and plant species were important influencers of root colonisation, although no M-AMF were visible following staining of M. stipoides roots. Soil age and host plant influenced fungal richness and community composition. However, response to soil age, potential host species, and water availability differed between M-AMF and G-AMF. Root colonisation of T. subterraneum by M-AMF and G-AMF was inversely correlated with soil P level. Community composition of M-AMF and G-AMF was structured by soil age and, to a lesser extent, plant species. Richness of M-AMF and G-AMF was negatively, and positively, correlated with available P, respectively. These findings are experimental evidence of ecological niche differentiation of M-AMF and G-AMF and invite further exploration into interactive effects of abiotic and biotic factors on their communities along successional trajectories.","2023","MAY 2023","10.1007/s00572-023-01111-x","WOS:000984161100001"

Within these environments there are a multitude of tracers undergoing reactions (e.g., phytoplankton growth, chemical reactions). The distribution of these reactive tracers is strongly influenced by turbulent mixing. With a 50 member ensemble of two-dimensional Rayleigh-Taylor-induced turbulent mixing, we show that the dynamics of a reactive tracer growing according to Fisher's equation are poorly captured by the ensemble mean. A fluctuation-dependent sink introduced by Reynolds averaging Fisher's equation transfers tracer concentration from the mean to the fluctuations. We compare the dynamics of the reactive tracer with those of a passive tracer. The reaction increases the reactive tracer's concentration thereby increasing Fickian diffusion and allowing the reactive tracer to diffuse into turbulent structures that the passive tracer cannot reach. A positive feedback between turbulent mixing and fluctuation growth is identified. We show that eddy viscosity and diffusivity parameterizations fail to capture the bulk trends of the system and identify a need for negative eddy diffusivities.

Here, we applied genome-resolved metagenomics and phylogenomics to investigate the ecological significance of cellular motility for niche differentiation and the links between the genetic makeup of motile bacteria and rhizosphere colonization within a four-decade maize field experiment. Indeed, highly diverse sets of genes encoding cellular motility, including chemotaxis, flagellar assembly and motility proteins, and uti-lization of polymeric carbon were the important predictors of bacterial niche differentiation between bulk and rhizo-sphere soils. This is well exemplified by metagenome-assembled genomes encoding high motility capacity (hmc_MAGs). Their collective abundance was, on average, sixfold higher in rhizosphere soil than in bulk soil. All bulk-soil-derived MAGs showed low motility capacities (lmc). The hmc_MAGs were highly enriched in beneficial traits involved in carbohydrate utilization, assimilatory (nasA) and dissimilatory (nirBD) nitrate reduction, inorganic phos-phate solubilization (gcd), and organic phosphate mineralization (phoD). Belonging to the families Sphingomonadaceae, Burkholderiaceae and Steroidobacteraceae, the hmc_MAGs showed a ninefold greater enrichment in these traits than proteobacterial lmc_MAGs and a twofold greater enrichment than 264 genomes publicly available for the above three families, thereby substantiating that a specific rhizosphere effect acted on the microbes represented by the hmc_MAGs. The particular link between the genetic capacities for high cellular motility and increased carbohydrate depolymerization as the key determinant for plant-selected rhizosphere colonization was further substantiated by the analysis of public bulk-rhizosphere soil metagenomes retrieved from wheat and cucumber field sites.","2023","JUN 2023","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164221","WOS:001022426400001"

However, pests pose a significant challenge to the productivity and sustainability of these agricultural systems. The need to reduce the usage of chemical pesticides in agriculture has intensified due to growing public health and environmental concerns. Retaining generalized predators to biologically control pests is commonly considered as an alternative management strategy. Bats are widely acknowledged as highly effective pest suppression agents. However, little is known about how bats contribute to pest suppression services in smallholder farming systems and how different sympatric bat species divide their use of food resources. We employed DNA metabarcoding to determine the differential prey species consumed by seven bat species in Chinese smallholder farming systems to clarify pest suppression services and dietary niche differentiation. We detected 19 orders of arthropods, among which mosquitos (Diptera), moths (Lepidoptera), and beetles (Coleoptera) were the most predominant prey items. We also documented 75 major pests consumed by bats that can potentially damage agricultural areas or spread diseases. Moreover, there was a significant differentiation among the seven sympatric bat species. Finally, Spearman correlation analysis shows that morphological and echolocation traits may explain dietary niche differentiation. Our results suggest that bats play a critical role in pest suppression services in smallholder farming systems and further prove that the dietary niche was significant differentiation among bat species. These results implied that landscape heterogeneity in smallholder farming systems may increase arthropod diversity, in turn increase biological pest control by bats. Thus, our results also highlight the importance of conserving bat populations and their crucial ecosystem services in integrated pest management (IPM), which has significant implications for the potential protection of food security and human health.","2023","DEC 2023","10.1007/s10340-023-01721-6","WOS:001129291900001"

We found that phytoplankton biomass was lower in the plume than in upwelled water. Diatoms were the only dominant group in the upwelled water. In contrast, diatoms and Synechococcus were co-dominant in the plume, and the negative correlation between the proportions of these two groups indicated that they occupied distinct niches. The lower phytoplankton biomass in plume waters was due to nutrient limitation, and there was a transition from limitation by phosphorus to limitation by nitrogen in the plume along its path. This bottom-up control limited only diatoms, whereas Synechococcus was limited mainly by top-down control via microzooplankton grazing. This difference led to niche differentiation of the dominant phytoplankton groups in the plume-upwelling system.

Decreased E484A fitness levels were over-compensated for by N501Y and Q498R, identifying a putative Omicron founder background that exceeds the intrinsic and effective fitness of WT and matches that of E484K. Critically, the E484A/Q498R/N501Y mutant and E484K have equal fitness also in presence of pre-Omicron vaccinee serum, whereas the fitness gain by E484K is lost in the presence of serum raised against the E484K variant in hamsters.ConclusionsThe emergence of E484A and E484Q prior to widespread population immunity may have been limited by fitness costs. In populations already exposed to the early immune escape epitope E484K, the Omicron founder background may have provided a basis for alternative immune escape evolution via E484A. Studies of major antigenic epitope changes with and without their epistatic context help reconstruct the sequential adjustments of intrinsic fitness versus neutralization escape during the evolution of major SARS-CoV-2 variants in an increasingly immune human population.","2023",NA,"10.1186/s12985-023-02154-4","WOS:001097361000001"

Two phylogenetically distinct groups of methanotrophs, type I (gamma-proteobacteria) and type II (alpha-proteobacteria) methanotrophs, often co-exist in rice paddy soil and compete for CH4 biotransformation. Since these two methanotrophic groups also possess differential kinetics of CH4 oxidation and pathways of C assimilation, the consequence of their niche differentiation and metabolic differences in soil is expected to affect the CH4 oxidation rate and C conversion efficiency. Here, we examined the microbiology, chemistry, and CH4 metabolism in 24 geographically different paddy soils, covering four climate zones of eastern China. High-throughput sequencing of pmoA gene displayed a clear separation of in situ methanotrophic compositions between temperate (warm and mid-temperate) and warmer (subtropics and tropics) climate zones, likely driven by soil pH. Both methanotrophic groups were detected in soils but proportions of type I methanotrophs increased in temperate soils of higher pH (accounting for 76.1 +/- 12.4% and 44.1 +/- 14.8% in warm temperate and mid-temperate, respectively). Type II methanotrophs prevailed in warmer zones (accounting for 66.2 +/- 21.6% and 70.5 +/- 12.1% in tropics and subtropics, respectively) where soils were more acidic. Higher incorporation of 13C for synthesis in C14+C16 PLFAs (63.1-93.4% of total production of 13C-PLFAs) was found based on microcosm incubation, reflecting type I methanotrophs dominated the CH4 assimilation in paddy soils. Particularly, temperate soils with increased proportions of type I methanotrophs showed higher CH4 oxidation rate and C conversion efficiency. Collectively, this study depicts a continental-scale disparity of methanotrophic dynamics that tightly associates with consequence of niche differentiation of different types of methanotrophs and highlights the importance of microbiological control to maximize the rate and efficiency of methanotrophy.","2023","DEC 2023","10.1007/s00374-023-01773-x","WOS:001110961600001"

However, the specific contribution of their activity to nitrification processes has remained unclear. We aimed to disentangle the contribution of CMX, AOA and AOB to nitrification and to identify the environmental drivers of their niche differentiation at different levels of ammonium and oxygen in oligotrophic carbonate rock aquifers. CMX ammonia monooxygenase sub-unit A (amoA) genes accounted on average for 16 to 75% of the total groundwater amoA genes detected. Nitrification rates were positively correlated to CMX clade A associated phylotypes and AOB affiliated with Nitrosomonas ureae. Short-term incubations amended with the nitrification inhibitors allylthiourea and chlorate suggested that AOB contributed a large fraction to overall ammonia oxidation, while metaproteomics analysis confirmed an active role of CMX in both ammonia and nitrite oxidation. Ecophysiological niche differentiation of CMX clades A and B, AOB and AOA was linked to their requirements for ammonium, oxygen tolerance, and metabolic versatility. Our results demonstrate that despite numerical predominance of CMX, the first step of nitrification in oligotrophic groundwater appears to be primarily governed by AOB. Higher growth yields at lower ammonia turnover rates and energy derived from nitrite oxidation most likely enable CMX to maintain consistently high populations.","2023","JUL 2023","10.1038/s41396-023-01471-4","WOS:001025715600001"

Understanding the microbial mechanisms for this variation may lead to better modelling of NI efficacy and therefore on-farm adoption. This study addressed the response patterns of mineral nitrogen, nitrous oxide (N2O) emission, abundances of N-cycling functional guilds and soil microbiota characteristics, in relation to urea application with or without DCD or DMPP in two arable soils (an alkaline and an acid soil). The inhibition of nitrification rate and N2O emission by NI application occurred by suppressing ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) abundances and increasing the abundances of nosZI-N2O reducers; however, abundances of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) were also stimulated with NIs-added in these two arable soils. DMPP generally had stronger inhibition efficiency than DCD, and both NIs' addition decreased Nitrobacter, while increased Nitrospira abundance only in alkaline soil. N2O emissions were positively correlated with AOB and negatively correlated with nosZI in both soils and AOA only in acid soil. Moreover, N2O emissions were also positively correlated with nirK-type denitrifiers in alkaline soil, and Glade A comammox in acid soil. Amendment with DCD or DMPP altered soil microbiota community structure, but had minor effect on community composition. These results highlight a crucial role of the niche differentiation among canonical ammonia oxidizers (AOA/AOB), Nitrobacter and Nitrospira, as well as nosZI- and nosZII-N2O reducers in determining the varying efficacies of DCD and DMPP in different arable soils.","2023","APR 2022","10.1007/s00248-022-02006-8","WOS:000782536500001"

We synthesized an arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal community with three fungal species that differed in their capacity of foraging for orthophosphate (P) due to differences in soil exploration. We tested whether AM fungal species-specific hyphosphere bacterial assemblages recruited by hyphal exudates enabled differentiation among the fungi in the capacity of mobilizing soil organic P (P-o). We found that the less efficient space explorer, Gigaspora margarita, obtained less C-13 from the plant, whereas it had higher efficiencies in P-o mobilization and alkaline phosphatase (AlPase) production per unit C than the two efficient space explorers, Rhizophagusintraradices and Funneliformis mosseae. Each AM fungus was associated with a distinct alp gene harboring bacterial assemblage, and the alp gene abundance and P-o preference of the microbiome associated with the less efficient space explorer were higher than those of the two other species. We conclude that the traits of AM fungal associated bacterial consortia cause niche differentiation. The trade-off between foraging ability and the ability to recruit effective P-o mobilizing microbiomes is a mechanism that allows co-existence of AM fungal species in a single plant root and surrounding soil habitat.","2023","JAN 2023","10.1007/s11427-022-2261-1","WOS:000935244900001"

However, the molecular composition and distribution of DOM and its interactions with microbes in deepsea sediments remain poorly understood. Here, molecular composition of DOM and its relationship with microbes were analyzed in samples collected from two sediment cores (-40 cm below the sea floor), at depths of 1157 and 2253 m from the South China Sea. Results show that niche differentiation was observed on a fine scale in different sediment layers, with Proteobacteria and Nitrososphaeria dominating the shallow sediments (0-6 cm) and Chloroflexi and Bathyarchaeia prevailing in deeper sediments (6-40 cm), indicating correspondence of microbial community composition with both geographical isolation and the availability of organic matter. An intimate link between the DOM composition and microbial community further indicates that, microbial mineralization of fresh organic matter in the shallow layer potentially resulted in the accumulation of recalcitrant DOM (RDOM), while relatively low abundance of RDOM was linked to anaerobic microbial utilization in deeper sediment layers. In addition, higher RDOM abundance in the overlying water, as compared to that in the surface sediment, suggests that sediment might be a source of deep-sea RDOM. These results emphasize the close relation between the distribution of sediment DOM and different microbial community, laying a foundation for understanding the complex dynamics of RDOM in deep-sea sediment and water column.","2023","JUL 2023","10.1016/j.envint.2023.108080","WOS:001039660200001"

However, combined effects of nitrogen addition and biodiversity on interactions among the stoichiometry of plants, soils, and soil microbes (stoichiometric networks, PSMNs) have largely been overlooked, even though PSMNs are likely critical predictors of ecosystem structure and functions.MethodsTo quantify effects of nitrogen addition and plant species richness on stoichiometric relations among plants, soils, and soil microbes, a common garden experiment with two nitrogen addition levels (0 and 6 g N m(- 2) year(- 1)) and four plant species richness levels (1, 2, 4, and 8 species) was conducted in which those driving factors were manipulated.ResultsNitrogen addition had minor effects on most stoichiometries of plant-soil-microbes, but plant species richness showed significant association with most stoichiometries. With nitrogen addition, increases in soil ammonium nitrogen led to a decrease in PSMNs connectivity but an increase in modularity. Plant species richness was negatively associated with network connectivity but positively correlated with modular complexity because of changes in soil nutrient availability and increased niche differentiation.ConclusionsThe findings demonstrate mechanistic links of biodiversity with the stoichiometry of plant-soil-microbes and stoichiometric networks, suggesting that biodiversity loss and resources decrease under global changes may enable a looser complexity in whole ecosystem element structure as indicated by the stoichiometric network architecture.","2023","MAY 2023","10.1007/s11104-023-06060-0","WOS:000982396100002"
"Song, WH; Li, JJ","The effects of intraspecific variation on forecasts of species range shifts under climate change","SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT","As global climate change is altering the distribution range of macroalgae across the globe, it is critical to assess its impact on species range shifts to inform the biodiversity conservation of macroalgae. Latitude/environmental gradients could cause intraspecific variability, which may result in distinct responses to climate change. It remains unclear whether geographical variation occurs in the response of species' populations to climate change. We tested this assumption using the brown alga Sargassum thunbergii, a habitat-forming macroalgae encompassing multiple divergent lineages along the Northwest Pacific. Previous studies revealed a distinct lineage of S. thunbergii in rear-edge populations. Given the phylogeographic structure and temperature gradients, we divided these populations into the southern and northern groups. We assessed the physiological responses of the two groups to temperature changes and estimated their niche differences using n-dimensional hypervolumes. A higher photosynthetic rate and antioxidative abilities were detected in the southern group of S. thunbergii than in the northern group. In addition, significant niche differentiation was detected between the two groups, suggesting the possibility for local adaptation. Given these results, we inferred that the southern group (rear-edge populations) may be more resilient to climate change. To examine climate-driven range shifts of S. thunbergii, we constructed species- and lineage-level species distribution models (SDMs). Predictions of both levels showed considerable distribution contracts along the Chinese coasts in the future. For the southern group, the lineage-level model predicted less habitat loss than the species-level model. Our results highlight the importance of considering intraspecific variation in climate change vulnerability assessments for coastal species.","2023","OCT 2022","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159513","WOS:000932884100003"

However, they have rarely been explored in microbial communities. Although microbial communities are highly diverse, the coexistence of their multiple taxa is largely attributed to niche differences and high dispersal rates, following the principle 'everything is everywhere, but the environment selects'. We use a dynamical stochastic model based on the theory of island biogeography to study highly diverse bacterial communities over time across three different systems (soils, alpine lakes and shallow saline lakes). Assuming fitness equalization mechanisms, here we newly analytically derive colonization-persistence trade-offs, and report a signal of such trade-offs in natural bacterial communities. Moreover, we show that different subsets of species in the community drive this trade-off. Rare taxa, which are occasional and more likely to follow independent colonization/extinction dynamics, drive this trade-off in the aquatic communities, while the core sub-community did it in the soils. We conclude that equalizing mechanisms may be more important than previously recognized in bacterial communities.

Soil bacterial community, which is the driver of litter decomposition and nutrient cycling, is assumed to control responses of terrestrial ecosystem structure and function to N and P addition. Using a high-throughput Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform, we conducted a 9-year field experiment of N (0, 5, 10, and 20 g N m-2 yr-1) and P (0 and 10 g P m-2 yr-1) additions in the Inner Mongolian steppes to elucidate long-term effects of N and P addition on soil bacterial richness, diversity and composition. We found that N addition reduced the relative abundance of Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Nitrospirae, while increased that of Bacteroides. The results showed that the bacterial biomarker was enriched in P addition treatments, either individually or combined with N addition. Both N and P addition altered the bacterial community structure, while only N addition greatly decreased bacterial richness and diversity. More importantly, we showed that all of these effects were most significant in N3P treatment (20 g N m-2 yr-1 and 10 g P m-2 yr-1), implying that P coupled with a high-level N addition exerted a great influence on soil bacterial community. Structural equation models revealed that N and P addition had a great direct effect on soil bacterial community and an indirect effect on it mainly by changing the litter biomass. Our findings highlighted that severe niche differentiation was induced by P along with a high-level N, further emphasizing the importance of simultaneously evaluating response of soil bacterial community to N and P addition, especially in the context of increasing anthropogenic nutrient additions.","2023","SEP 2023","10.1007/s00248-023-02297-5","WOS:001066738900001"

Here we use isolates from seven major taxa to demonstrate a tradeoff between phototrophic performance (growth in the absence of prey) and phagotrophic performance (clearance rate when consuming Prochlorococcus). We then show that trophic strategy along the autotrophy-mixotrophy spectrum correlates strongly with global niche differences, across depths and across gradients of stratification and chlorophyll a.

Understanding the niche differentiation of biofilm microbial communities is necessary for the efficient control of DWDS biofilms. However, biofilm studies are difficult to conduct in the actual DWDS because of inaccessibility to the pipes buried underground. Taking the opportunity of infrastructure construction and relevant pipeline replacement in China, biofilms in a DWDS (a water main and its branch pipes) were collected in situ, followed by analysis on the abundances and community structures of bacterial and archaeal using quantitative PCR and high-throughput sequencing, respectively. Results showed that archaea were detected only in the biofilms of the water main, with a range of 9.4x10(3)similar to 1.1x10(5) copies/cm(2). By contrast, bacteria were detected in the biofilms of branch pipes and the distal part of the water main, with a range of 8.8x10(3)similar to 9.6x10(6) copies/cm(2). Among the biofilm samples, the archaeal community in the central part of the water main showed the highest richness and diversity. Nitrosopumilus was found to be predominant (86.22%) in the biofilms of the proximal part of the water main. However, Methanobrevibacter (87.15%) predominated in the distal part of the water main. The bacterial community of the water main and branch pipes was primarily composed of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria at the phylum level, respectively. Regardless of archaea or bacteria, only few operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (<0.5% of total OTUs) were shared by all the biofilms, indicating the niche differentiation of biofilm microorganisms. Moreover, the high Mn content in the biofilms of the distal sampling location (D3) in the water main was linked to the predominance of Bacillus. Functional gene prediction revealed that the proportion of infectious disease-related genes was 0.44-0.67% in the tested biofilms. Furthermore, functional genes related to the resistance of the bacterial community to disinfections and antibiotics were detected in all the samples, that is, glutathione metabolism-relating genes (0.14-0.65%) and beta-lactam resistance gene (0.01-0.05%). The results of this study indicate the ubiquity of archaea and bacteria in the biofilms of water main and branch pipes, respectively, and pipe diameters could be a major influencing factor on bacterial community structure. In the water main, the key finding was the predominant existence of archaea, particularly Nitrosopumilus and methanogen. Hence, their routine monitoring and probable influences on water quality in pipelines with large diameter should be given more attention. Besides, since Mn-related Bacillus and suspected pathogenic Enterococcus were detected in the biofilm, supplementation of disinfectant may be a feasible strategy for inhibiting their growth and ensuring water quality. In addition, the monitoring on their abundance variation could help to determine the frequency and methods of pipeline maintenance.","2023","AUG 2023","10.1007/s00248-023-02274-y","WOS:001042788900001"

However, exploration of the niche differentiation of canonical nitrifiers and comammox Nitrospira and their ecological importance in agroecosystems is still limited. Here, we adopted quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Illumina MiSeq sequencing to investigate the effects of five long-term fertilization regimes in the variations of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB), and comammox Nitrospira abundances and comammox community composition in two soil layers (0-20 cm, topsoil; 20-40 cm, subsoil) in an Alfisol in Northeast China. The fertilization treatments included no fertilizer (CK); chemical nitrogen (N) fertilizer; chemical N; phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertilizers (NPK); recycled organic manure (M) and chemical N, P, K plus recycled manure (MNPK). Compared with CK, manure and/or chemical fertilizer significantly increased the AOB amoA gene abundance. Long-term recycled manure increased soil organic matter (SOM) contents and maintained the soil pH, but decreased the NH4+-N concentrations, which markedly promoted the nxrA and nxrB gene abundances of NOB and the amoA gene abundances of comammox Nitrospira clade A and AOA. Although the comammox Nitrospira clade B abundance tended to decrease after fertilization, the structural equation modeling analysis showed that comammox clade B had direct positive impacts on soil potential ammonia oxidation (PAO; lambda = 0.59, p < 0.001). The long-term fertilization regime altered the community composition of comammox Nitrospira. Additionally, comammox Nitrospira clades A and B had individual response patterns to the soil layer. The relative abundance of clade A was predominant in the topsoil in the N (86.5%) and MNPK (76.4%) treatments, while clade B appeared to be dominant in the subsoil (from 78.7 to 88.1%) with lower ammonium contents, implying niche separation between these clades.

Because foraging behavior is directly linked to traits that scale allometrically with size (e.g., metabolic rate, locomotion), we hypothesized that habitat use and diet selection would likewise exhibit nonlinear scaling relationships. All three antelope species selected habitat near termitaria, which are hotspots of abundant, high-quality forage. Experimental removal of forage from termite mounds sharply reduced use of those mounds by bushbuck, confirming that habitat selection was resource driven. Strength of selection for termite mounds scaled negatively and nonlinearly with body mass, as did recursion (frequency with which individuals revisited locations), whereas home-range area and mean step length scaled positively and nonlinearly with body mass. All species disproportionately ate mound-associated plant taxa; nonetheless, forage selectivity and dietary composition, richness, and quality all differed among species, reflecting the partitioning of shared food resources. Dietary protein exhibited the theoretically predicted negative allometric relationship with body mass, whereas digestible-energy content scaled positively. Our results demonstrate cryptic size-based separation along spatial and dietary niche axes-despite superficial similarities among species-consistent with the idea that body-size differentiation is driven by selection for divergent resource-acquisition strategies, which in turn underpin coexistence. Foraging and space-use behaviors were nonlinearly related to body mass, supporting the hypothesis that behavior scales allometrically with size. However, explaining the variable functional forms of these relationships is a challenge for future research.","2023","SEP 2022","10.1002/ecm.1549","WOS:000856569100001"

Host-associated microbial communities, and particularly bacterial communities, are shaped by different host factors such as habitat, diet, and phylogeny. Here, we studied the structures of bacterial and microbial eukaryote communities associated with Amazonian ants collected from two habitats: the rainforest and the city. We collected 38 ant species covering a large taxonomic range, and we used 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA amplicon sequencing to study the impact of the host's ecological and phylogenetic factors on their microbial communities. Our results show that (1) habitat does not structure ant microbial communities, (2) ant diet and nesting mode impact bacterial communities, while only nesting mode structures microbial eukaryote communities, and (3) microbial diversity is not correlated with host phylogeny, although several ant genera have conserved bacterial communities. As we continue to uncover the diversity and function of insect-associated microbes, this work explores how host ecology and evolutionary history shape ant microbial communities.","2023",NA,"10.3390/d15020126","WOS:000945134300001"

In the last 20 years, the analysis of natural variations in stable isotope ratios (15N/14N, 13C/12C) has revolutionized our view on soil animal trophic ecology. Here, we review the state of the art of the trophic ecology of a highly abundant and diverse soil animal taxon, oribatid mites (Oribatida), investigated by stable isotope analyses. The review is based on 25 papers reporting stable isotope data of 292 oribatid mite taxa from 30 different sites. Four main findings emerged. (1) Oribatid mites cluster into six trophic groups, i.e. moss feeders, lichen feeders, primary decomposers, fungal feeders/secondary decomposers, predators/scavengers and marine algal feeders, plus one additional group, which incorporates CaCO3 in their cuticle for defence but still belongs to the fungal feeders/secondary decomposers group. (2) Of the 292 species studied 43.7% were classified as fungal feeders/secondary decomposers, 27.0% as primary de-composers and 15.7% as predators/scavengers, only few species include CaCO3 into their skeleton (6.1%), feed on lichens (4.9%), mosses (2.1%) or marine algae (0.7%). (3) In about one-third of the species studied the trophic niche was constant or varied little between sites or habitats, but in two-thirds of the species their trophic niche varied between habitats, with some species even shifting trophic levels, indicating trophic plasticity. (4) When aggregated at higher taxonomic level oribatid mite species clustered in only three instead of six trophic groups. This indicates that species within the same high level taxon often belong to different trophic groups, for example because feeding habits evolved convergently. Therefore, to accurately reflect the trophic ecology of oribatid mites their stable isotope signatures need to be analysed at species level. However, stable isotope analyses also have limitations, e.g. feeding on bacteria and fungi cannot be separated, and the same is true for feeding on ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Other methods such as fatty acid, amino acid and molecular gut content analyses as well as microbiome analyses may complement stable isotope studies and resolve oribatid mite trophic niche differentiation at a higher resolution. This will contribute to a better understanding of the local coexistence of large numbers of species in soil. Finally, we provide perspectives on how to integrate microarthropods into soil food webs using stable isotope and other methods allowing deeper insight into their trophic structure.","2023","NOV 2022","10.1016/j.soilbio.2022.108890","WOS:000903499300001"

Understanding the geographic pattern of river microbial traits in biogeochemical processes can provide important insights into river health. Many studies have characterized river microbial traits in specific situations, but the geographic patterns of these traits and environmental drivers at a large scale are unknown. We reanalyzed 4505 raw 16S rRNA sequences samples for microbiota from river basins in China. The results indicated differences in the diversity, composition, and structure of microbiotas across diverse river basins. Microbial diversity and functional potential in the river basins decreased over time in northern China and increased in southern China due to niche differentiation, e.g., the Yangtze River basin was the healthiest ecosystem. River microbiotas were mainly involved in the cycling of carbon and nitrogen in the river ecosystems and participated in potential organic metabolic functions. Anthropogenic pollutants discharge was the most critical environmental driver for the microbial traits, e.g., antibiotic discharge, followed by climate change. The prediction by machine-learning models indicated that the continuous discharge of antibiotics and climate change led to high ecological risks for the rivers. Our study provides guidelines for improving the health of river ecosystems and for the formulation of strategies to restore the rivers.","2023","FEB 2023","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162070","WOS:000945118900001"

We investigated in situ dissolved N2O as well as potential N2O production rate (NPR), reduction rate (NRR), and emission rate (NER), and key functional genes related to N2O transformation of denitrification in the Pearl River Estuary. Higher N2O emission potential was found in the upstream and midstream regions with higher NPR and lower NRR values. In contrast, higher NRR values were detected in downstream. Notably, nirS and nirK type N2O producers dominated the upstream zone, whereas abundant N2O reducers, especially nosZ II type N2O reducers, were observed in downstream. Most importantly, the gene abundance ratio (Rnir/nosZ) was significantly correlated with the N2O emission potential (Re).

Based on the classification of the total, abundance, and rare taxa for bacteria and fungi, a multivariate statistical analysis was carried out. The results revealed that bacterial community Shannon diversity and Pielou's evenness were highest in TK. The rare taxa were ubiquitous in all soil samples, while the higher Shannon diversity of the abundant taxa of TK may be related to the habitat preferences of species and niche differentiation. The community composition of bacterial and fungal sub-communities exhibited significant dissimilarity between TK and KL.

In hyper-diverse environments like tropical rain forests, coexistence of epiphytic orchids may be facilitated through mycorrhizal fungal specialization (i.e., sets of unique and dominant mycorrhizal fungi associated with a particular host species). However, information on the role of orchid mycorrhizal fungi (OMF) in niche differentiation and coexistence of epiphytic orchids is still scarce. In this study, we sought to identify the variation in fungal preferences of four co-occurring epiphytic orchids in a tropical rainforest in Costa Rica by addressing the identity and composition of their endophytic fungal and OMF communities across species and life stages. We show that the endophytic fungal communities are formed mainly of previously recognized OMF taxa, and that the four coexisting orchid species have both a set of shared mycorrhizal fungi and a group of fungi unique to an orchid species. We also found that adult plants keep the OMF of the juvenile stage while adding new mycobionts over time. This study provides evidence for the utilization of specific OMF that may be involved in niche segregation, and for an aggregation mechanism where adult orchids keep initial fungal mycobionts of the juvenile stage while adding others.","2023","JAN 2023","10.1007/s00572-022-01099-w","WOS:000920118600001"

The contamination and distribution of PAHs were jointly affected by anthropogenic and natural factors. Some of the keystone taxa were identified as PAH-degrading bacteria (i.e., genera Defluviimonas, Mycobacterium, families 67-14, Rhodobacteraceae, Microbacteriaceae and order Gaiellales in water) or biomarkers (i.e., Gaiellales in sediment) that were significantly correlated with PAH levels. The proportion of deterministic process in the high PAH-polluted water (76%) was much higher than that in the low pollution area (7%), confirming the significant effect of PAHs on the microbial community assembly. In sediment, the communities with high phylogenetic diversity demonstrated a great extent of niche differentiation, exhibited a stronger response to environmental variables and were strongly influenced by deterministic processes (40%). Overall, deterministic and stochastic processes are closely related to the distribution and mass transfer of pollutants, and substantially affect the biological aggregation and interspecies interaction within communities in the habitats.","2023","JUN 2023","10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.131762","WOS:001018340800001"

Three primary ecotypes were identified: a Nitrosopumilus-like clade; a Nitrosopelagicus-like water column A (WCA) clade, thriving in epipelagic water; and a water column B (WCB) clade, dominant in deep water. Depth-related partitioning of the three ecotypes and the seasonal variability of the WCA and WCB ecotypes were observed. Nutrient concentrations, chlorophyll alpha and salinity were the primary environmental factors. The relative abundance of the WCA ecotype and its transcript abundance of amoA gene were positively correlated with chlorophyll alpha and salinity, while the WCB ecotype was positively correlated with nitrate and phosphate. Based on high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes, transcriptomic analysis revealed that the three ecotypes exhibited various co-occurring expression patterns of the elemental cycling genes in the nitrogen, carbon, phosphorus, and sulfur cycles.

Results suggested that cadmium (0.12-7.22 mg kg- 1) and copper (18.99-11282.03 mg kg- 1) were the main pollutants in the test soil profiles, and their concentrations gradually decreased with depth. The surrounding contaminated farmland has a more complex interaction and higher modularity (0.77-0.85) among microbes, indicating a stronger niche differentiation to enhance functional diversity.

In this study, the effect of Klebsiella oxytoca on the development of D. suzukii was examined at physiological and molecular levels. The results showed that, after the removal of gut microbiota, the survival rate and longevity of axenic D. suzukii decreased significantly. Reintroduction of K. oxytoca to the midgut of D. suzukii advanced the development level of D. suzukii. The differentially expressed genes and metabolites between axenic and K. oxytoca-reintroduced D. suzukii were enriched in the pathways of carbohydrate metabolism. This advancement was achieved through an increased glycolysis rate and the regulation of the transcript level of key genes in the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway. Klebsiella oxytoca is likely to play an important role in increasing host fitness in their high-sugar ecological niche by stimulating the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway. As a protein source, bacteria can also provide direct nutrition for D. suzukii, which depends on the quantity or biomass of K. oxytoca.

In this study, we investigated the effects of biochar and/or DMPP application on N2O emissions from different agricultural soils (i.e., vegetable, tea, and peach orchards grown for 1 and 7 years) through an incubation experiment. Biochar application significantly reduced N2O emissions from vegetable and tea soils by inhibiting ammonia oxidation. In contrast, in peach orchard soils, adding biochar promoted N2O emissions due to the positive effect of biochar on ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), which accelerated ammonia oxidation and the inhibition of N2O reduction. DMPP application mitigated 57-74% of soil N2O emissions due to its inhibitory effect on AOB. When biochar and DMPP were co-applied, biochar reduced the efficiency of DMPP in mitigating N2O emissions from tea and peach soils as biochar addition weakened the inhibitory effect of DMPP on AOB. However, N2O emissions from vegetable soils could be further reduced by the synergistic inhibition of ammonia oxidation by biochar and DMPP. Our results suggest that DMPP had a stable mitigation effect on N2O emissions in different soils, while biochar addition could potentially weaken the efficiency of DMPP. The mitigation effect of the co-application of biochar and nitrification inhibitors needs to be explored in future studies under field conditions.","2023","DEC 2022","10.1007/s00374-022-01688-z","WOS:000895634100002"

Furthermore, microplastic core bacteria had stronger geographic limitations along the Yangtze River in the Three Gorges Reservoir area. Stronger geographic limitations shaped the rapid community turnover and a potentially more connected network for the microplastic core bacteria than water, sediment, and soil.

This study reports putative spherical fossils preserved in the Devonian Hollard Mound hydrocarbon-seep deposit. Based on petrographical, mineralogical, and geochemical evidence the putative microfossils are interpreted as sulfide-oxidizing bacteria similar to the present-day genus Thiomargarita, which is also found at modern hydrocarbon seeps. The morphology, distribution, size, and occurrence of the fossilized cells show a large degree of similarity to their modern counterparts. Some of the spherical fossils adhere to worm tubes analogous to the occurrence of modern Thiomargarita on the tubes of seep-dwelling siboglinid worms. Fluorapatite crystals were identified within the fossilized cell walls, suggesting the intercellular storage of phosphorus analogous to modern Thiomargarita cells. The preservation of large sulfide-oxidizing bacteria was probably linked to changing biogeochemical processes at the Hollard Mound seep or, alternatively, may have been favored by the sulfide-oxidizing bacteria performing nitrate-dependent sulfide oxidation-a process known to induce carbonate precipitation. The presence of sulfide-oxidizing bacteria at a Devonian hydrocarbon seep highlights the similarities of past and present chemosynthesis-based ecosystems and provides valuable insight into the antiquity of biogeochemical processes and element cycling at Phanerozoic seeps.","2023","DEC 2023","10.1111/gbi.12581","WOS:001138392400001"

However, the effect of geographic distance and its related factors (i.e., salinity and nutrients) on bacterial diversity, co-occurrence, as well as community assembly on the abundant and rare species scale remained to be discussed. In this study, we deci-phered the bacterial dynamics and ecological processes in the anthropogenic estuary of the Haihe River, in China. The results revealed that salinity was the major abiotic factor to shape bacterial community composition, diversity, and network complexity, and the role of biotic cytometric characteristics was considerable as well. Furthermore, the salinity gradient tended to select bacteria with low nucleic acid (LNA) such as Candidatus Pelagibacter and Longivirga, and abundant bacteria were more sensitive to the salinity gradient in comparison with rare ones. The similar keystone number and network topology values indicated that both abundant and rare bacteria played important ecological functions in degrading pollutants, developing co-occurrence networks, and maintaining compositional stability and complexity. In addition, drift and dispersion limitation dominated the ecological processes in the community assembly, suggesting that although salinity caused the migration of species, its ecological role was still weaker than that of stochastic processes. Further, niche differentiation contributed to different stochastic components of abundant and rare species. In high-salinity areas, rare bacteria with small population sizes but high diversity were enriched, which made the bacterial community more affected by ecological drift. Our study illustrated the different responses of abundant and rare bacteria to salinity and the assembly process of bacterial communities in anthropogenic estuary, deepening the understanding of their ecological processes in the estuarine ecosystem.","2023","DEC 2022","10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109820","WOS:000909703700001"

The trophodynamics of E. superba and T. macrura at different ontogenetic stages (furcilia, juvenile, adult) were studied using fatty acid and stable isotope biomarkers in the samples collected in Amundsen Sea during austral summer of 2017/2018 and 2018/2019. Diatoms like Fragilariopsis spp. was the most abundant phytoplankton species in the summer of 2017/2018, while the abundance of phytoplankton in the summer of 2018/2019 was dominated by Phaeocystis sp. The gradual increase of the carnivorous index 18:1n-9/18:1n-7 with ontogeny of both species in 2018/2019 indicated more carnivorous feeding of adults compared with juveniles and larvae. Meanwhile, greater delta N-15 values of T. macrura than that of E. superba were more significant in the juvenile and adult stages during the summer of 2018/2019.

Phosphorus (P) is a critical limiting element for eutrophication. Submerged macrophytes with different stoichiometric homeostasis regulated sedi-ment P pollution by nutrient resorption, but whether and how P homeostasis and resorption in submerged macrophytes changed under variable plant community structure was unclear. Increasing evidence suggests that rhizosphere microbes drive niche overlap and differentiation for different P forms to constitute submerged macrophyte community structure. However, a greater understanding of how this occurs is required. This study examined the process underlying the metabolism of different rhizosphere P forms of submerged macrophytes under different cultivation patterns by analyzing physicochemical data, basic plant traits, microbial commu-nities, and transcriptomics. The results indicate that alkaline phosphatase serves as a key factor in revealing the existence of a link between plant traits (path coefficient = 0.335, p < 0.05) and interactions with rhizosphere microbial communities (average path coefficient = 0.362, p < 0.05). Moreover, this study demonstrates that microbial communities further influence the niche plasticity of P by mediating plant root P metabolism genes (path coefficient = 0.354, p < 0.05) and rhizosphere microbial phosphorus storage (average path coefficient = 0.605, p < 0.01). This research not only contributes to a deeper comprehension of stoichiometric homeostasis and nutrient dynamics but also provides valuable insights into potential strategies for managing and restoring submerged macrophyte-dominated ecosystems in the face of changing nutrient conditions.","2023","OCT 2023","10.1016/j.watres.2023.120679","WOS:001096488400001"

The present study assesses for the first time light utilization and functional metabolic stratification of SST on a millimeter scale through shotgun metagenomics. In addition, a scanning-electron-microscopy approach was used to explore the community. The analysis on SST unveiled the profile of a photosynthetic mat, with cyanobacteria not directly exposed to light, but placed just below a high-UV-resistant community. Calvin-Benson and 3-hydroxypropinate cycles for carbon fixation were abundant in upper, oxic layers, while the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway was dominant in the deeper anoxic strata. The high abundance of genes for UV-screening and oxidant-quenching pigments and CPF (photoreactivation) in the UV-stressed layers could indicate that the zone itself works as a UV shield. There is a remarkable density of sequences associated with photoreceptors in the first two layers. Also, genetic evidence of photosynthesis split in eukaryotic (layer 1) and prokaryotic (layer 2). Photoheterotrophic bacteria, aerobic photoautotrophic bacteria, and anaerobic photoautotrophic bacteria coexist by selectively absorbing different parts of the light spectrum (blue, red, and IR respectively) at different positions of the mat.

However, their environmental preferences and factors that predict their biogeographic distribution have not been elucidated. Because most nitrifiers share the same basic life strategies and requirements, the best predictor of large-scale comammox bacterial abundance may be the abundance of other nitrifying guilds. To validate this hypothesis, we assembled data from 60 studies conducted in cropland, grassland, and forest ecosystems to identify abiotic and biotic parameters with the potential to predict comammox bacterial abundance and compare their predictive powers using random forest modelling. As expected, ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) are the top two factors predicting comammox bacterial abundance, followed by soil pH and nitrate and ammonium (NH4+). Consistent evidence is present from cropland, grassland, and forest landscapes to show that comammox Nitrospira co-vary positively with AOA. On large spatial scales, soil pH and NH4+ are the dominant influence on the abundance of clades A and B, respectively. A negative correlation with rainfall and acidity implies that clade A prefers dry, non-acidic environments, whereas a negative correlation with NH4+ and rainfall indicates that clade B prefers dry, oligotrophic environments. These findings reveal that predictors at the aggregate and clade scales do not overlap, and the predictors of any single genetic clade may not be predictive of total abundance. Comammox Nitrospira prefer to cometabolize with AOA with the same ecological preferences, hence the strongly positive population covariation. However, the predictive power of incomplete nitrifiers as predictors may decline when modelling the abundance of a single genetic clade. At the clade level, comammox bacterial abundance is highly modulated by abiotic factors such as pH and NH4+. Niche differentiation between clade A and clade B is influenced more by pH and N status than by water status.","2023","JUN 2023","10.1016/j.soilbio.2023.109079","WOS:001039588500001"

Supporting our main hypothesis, diversity of the bulk mite community and individual functional groups was associated with the diversity and quality of resources across trophic levels. The total taxonomic richness was highest in the shrubland successional stage, where plant diversity was the highest, and decreased in late-successional stages despite a similar abundance. Diversity of predatory and fungivorous mites was positively associated with the diversity of nematode and fungal communities and reached maximum at the shrubland and grassland stages, respectively.

Our research indicates that the diversity of Camellia oleifera endophytic bacterial communities is highly dependent on the plant compartment. The species replacement process (69.90%) is the dominant factor in the differences in bacterial community structure. The dominant bacteria phyla (Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, and Verrucomicrobia) of Camellia oleifera show a significant plant compartment (roots, stems, leaves, fruits) enrichment effects.

The difference in bacterial composition between cover crop systems appears to be partly influenced by soil nitrogen concentration and lime buffer capacity. Overall community diversity was associated with nitrogen and metal ion concentrations, and these associations were both stronger and more numerous later in the season.

The periplasmic enzyme hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO) is involved in the oxidation of hydroxylamine to nitric oxide in the second step of nitrification, producing N2O as a byproduct. Its three-dimensional structure demonstrates that slight differences in HAO active site residues have inhibitor effects. Therefore, a more detailed understanding of the diversity of HAO active site residues in soil microorganisms is important for the development of novel nitrification inhibitors using structure-guided drug design. However, this has not yet been examined. In the present study, we investigated hao gene diversity in beta-proteobacterial ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (beta-AOB) and complete ammonia-oxidizing (comammox; Nitrospira spp.) bacteria in agricultural fields using a clone library analysis. A total of 1,949 hao gene sequences revealed that hao gene diversity in beta-AOB and comammox bacteria was affected by the fertilizer treatment and field type, respectively. Moreover, hao sequences showed the almost complete conservation of the six HAO active site residues in both beta-AOB and comammox bacteria. The diversity of nitrifying bacteria showed similarity between hao and amoA genes. The nxrB amplicon sequence revealed the dominance of Nitrospira cluster II in tea field soils. The present study is the first to reveal hao gene diversity in agricultural soils, which will accelerate the efficient screening of HAO inhibitors and evaluations of their suppressive effects on nitrification in agricultural soils.","2023",NA,"10.1264/jsme2.ME23068","WOS:001140022100005"

It is well established that the appearance of distal metastasis in CRC patients is the cause of a poor prognosis and treatment failure. Nevertheless, in the last decades, CRC aggressiveness and progression have been attributed to a specific cell population called CRC stem cells (CCSC) with features like tumor initiation capacity, self-renewal capacity, and acquired multidrug resistance. Emerging data highlight the concept of this cell subtype as a plastic entity that has a dynamic status and can be originated from different types of cells through genetic and epigenetic changes. These alterations are modulated by complex and dynamic crosstalk with environmental factors by paracrine signaling. It is known that in the tumor niche, different cell types, structures, and biomolecules coexist and interact with cancer cells favoring cancer growth and development. Together, these components constitute the tumor microenvironment (TME). Most recently, researchers have also deepened the influence of the complex variety of microorganisms that inhabit the intestinal mucosa, collectively known as gut microbiota, on CRC. Both TME and microorganisms participate in inflammatory processes that can drive the initiation and evolution of CRC. Since in the last decade, crucial advances have been made concerning to the synergistic interaction among the TME and gut microorganisms that condition the identity of CCSC, the data exposed in this review could provide valuable insights into the biology of CRC and the development of new targeted therapies.","2023",NA,"10.4252/wjsc.v15.i5.281","WOS:001015272000001"

However, knowledge on microbial ecology of these systems does not match with their global importance. To close this knowledge gap, we sampled three niches including weathered rock, sediment, and drip water inside the Heshang Cave and three types of soils overlying the cave (forest soil, farmland soil, and pristine karst soil). All these samples were subjected to high-throughput sequencing of V4-V5 region of 16S rRNA gene and analyzed with multivariate statistical analysis. Overall, archaeal communities were dominated by Thaumarchaeota, whereas Actinobacteria dominated bacterial communities. Thermoplasmata, Nitrosopumilaceae, Aenigmarchaeales, Crossiella, Acidothermus, and Solirubrobacter were the important predictor groups inside the Heshang Cave, which were correlated to NH4+ availability. In contrast, Candidatus Nitrososphaera, Candidatus Nitrocosmicus, Thaumarchaeota Group 1.1c, and Pseudonocardiaceae were the predictors outside the cave, whose distribution was correlated with pH, Ca2+, and NO2-. Tighter network structures were found in archaeal communities than those of bacteria, whereas the topological properties of bacterial networks were more similar to those of total prokaryotic networks. Both chemolithoautotrophic archaea (Candidatus Methanoperedens and Nitrosopumilaceae) and bacteria (subgroup 7 of Acidobacteria and Rokubacteriales) were the dominant keystone taxa within the co-occurrence networks, potentially playing fundamental roles in obtaining energy under oligotrophic conditions and thus maintaining the stability of the cave ecosystem. To be noted, all the keystone taxa of karst ecosystems were related to nitrogen cycling, which needs further investigation, particularly the role of archaea. The predicted ecological functions in karst soils mainly related to carbohydrate metabolism, biotin metabolism, and synthesis of fatty acid. Our results offer new insights into archaeal ecology, their potential functions, and archaeal interactions with bacteria, which enhance our understanding about the microbial dark matter in the subsurface karst ecosystems.","2023",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2023.1068595","WOS:000937730000001"

The influence of DMPP efficiency on N2O miti-gation was clearly affected by spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Using field and incubation experiments combined with metagenomic sequencing, we aimed to investigate DMPP efficiency and the underlying microbial mecha-nisms in dark-brown (Siping, SP), fluvo-aquic (Cangzhou, CZ; Xinxiang, XX), and red soil (Wenzhou, WZ) from diverse climatic zones. In the field experiments, the DMPP efficiency in N2O mitigation ranged from 51.6% to 89.9%, in the order of XX, CZ, SP, and WZ. The DMPP efficiency in the incubation experiments ranged from 58.3% to 93.9%, and the order of efficiency from the highest to lowest was the same as that of the field ex-periments. Soil organic matter, total N, pH, texture, and taxonomic and functional & alpha;-diversity were important soil environment and microbial factors for DMPP efficiency. DMPP significantly enriched ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB), which promoted N-cycling with low N2O emissions. Random forest (RF) and regression analyses found that an AOA (Nitrosocosmicus) and NOB (Nitrospina) demonstrated important and positive correlation with DMPP efficiency. Moreover, genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism were important for DMPP efficiency and could influenced N-cycling and DMPP metabolism. The similar DMPP effi-ciency indicated that the variation in DMPP efficiency was significantly due to soil physicochemical and mi-crobial variations. In conclusion, filling the knowledge gap regarding the response of DMPP efficiency to abiotic and biotic factors could be beneficial in DMPP applications, and in adapting more efficient strategies to improve DMPP efficiency and mitigate N2O emissions in multiple regions.","2023","JUL 2023","10.1016/j.envres.2023.116761","WOS:001048790500001"

Sediment heterotrophic bacteria have a pivotal role in the degradation of kelp biomass, however, the response of sediment mi-crobial communities to periodic kelp biomass inputs is mostly unknown. Here, we show that kelp biomass induced rapid changes in overlying water chemistry and shifts in sediment microbial communities, which differed in the exper-imental systems containing Macrocystis pyrifera (M) and Undaria pinnatifida (U) with sediments of the respective re-gions. We observed results compatible with the degradation of labile, high molecular weight compounds into smaller and more refractory compounds towards the end of the incubations. The capability of microbial communities to degrade alginate, the major component of kelp cell walls, significantly increased with respect to controls after kelp biomass addition (Absorbance at 235 nm 1.2 +/- 0.3 and 1.0 +/- 0.2 for M and U, respectively, controls <0.2, t = 4 days). Shifts in microbial community structure (based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing) were tightly related to the kelp treatment and, to a lesser extent, to the sediment provenance (Principal Coordinates Analysis, 80 % of variation explained in the first two axes). Dissolved oxygen, pH, salinity, alginolytic potential, Absorbance at 235 and 600 nm, total N, total C, and SUVA index correlated significantly with community structure. Differentially abundant popula-tions between kelp-amended treatments and controls included members of the Flavobacteriia class (Algibacter and Polaribacter), and Gammaproteobacteria (Psychromonas and Marinomonas), among others. Metagenomes of M and U-amended sediments contained sequences from 18 of the 19 enzyme families related to alginate or fucoidan degra-dation.

Despite its importance, there is a dearth of studies revealing how fertiliza-tion regimes influence diazotrophic community behind soil aggregates, as well as the potential consequences for crop yields. To do this, a two-decade fertilization of wheat-maize intercropping field experiment was conducted in Loess Plateau of China semiarid area under three treatments: no fertilizer, chemical and organic fertilizer. Moreover, we cat-egorized soil aggregates as large macroaggregates (>2 mm), medium macroaggregates (1-2 mm), small macroaggre-gates (0.25-1 mm), microaggregates (< 0.25 mm) and rhizosphere soils aggregates. We found that soil aggregates exerted a much more influence on the nifH gene abundance than fertilization practices. Particularly, nifH gene abun-dance has been promoted with increasing the size of soil aggregates fraction without blank soil in the organic fertili-zation while its abundance presented contrast patterns in the chemical fertilization. Bipartite association networks indicated that different soil aggregates shaped niche differentiation of diazotrophic community behind fertilization regimes. Additionally, we found that organic fertilization strengthens the robustness of diazotrophic communities as well as increases the complexity of microbial networks by harboring keystone taxa. Mantel test results suggested that specific soil factors exerted more selective power on diazotrophic community and nifH gene abundance in the chemical fertilization. Furthermore, )3-diversity and nifH gene abundance of diazotrophic communities in the soil microaggregates jointly determine the crop yields. Collectively, our findings emphasize the key role of functional community diversity in sustaining soil cycling process and crop yields under long-term fertilization, and facilitate our understanding of the mechanisms underlying diazotrophic community in response to agricultural intensification, which could pave the way to sustainable agriculture through manipulating the functional taxa.","2023","JAN 2023","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.161359","WOS:000960732500001"

The genome formula describes the relative frequencies of all viral genome segments, and previous work suggests rapid changes in these frequencies facilitate virus adaptation. Many studies have reported mixed viral infections in plants, often resulting in strong virus-virus interactions. Here, we tested whether mixed infections with tripartite alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) and monopartite potato virus Y (PVY) affected the genome formula of the tripartite cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), our experimental model. We found that the CMV titer was reduced in mixed infections with its tripartite Bromoviridae relative AMV and in triple infections with both AMV and PVY, indicating notable virus-virus interactions. The variability of the CMV genome formula was significantly lower in mixed infections (CMV and AMV, CMV and PVY, and CMV and AMV and PVY) than in single infections (CMV only). These observations led to the surprising conclusion that mixed infections with two distinct viruses constrain the CMV genome formula. It remains unclear how common these effects are for different combinations of virus species and strains and what the underlying mechanisms are. We, therefore, extended a simulation model to consider three putative scenarios in which a second virus affected the genome formula. The simulation results also suggested that shifts in the genome formula occur, but may not be widespread due to the required conditions. One scenario modeled-co-infection exclusion through niche differentiation-was congruent with the experimental data, as this scenario led to reductions in genome formula variability and titer of the multipartite virus. Whereas previous studies highlighted host-species effects, our results indicate that the genome formula is also affected by mixed infections, suggesting that there is a broader set of environmental cues that affect the genome formula.","2023",NA,"10.3389/fviro.2023.1225818","WOS:001086835200001"

The first 3 years of the experiment demonstrated that crop mixtures do not only increase yield compared with an average monoculture but often also compared with the highest yielding monoculture. The crop diversity effects were stronger under more stressful environmental conditions and were often achieved in mixtures with legume crops. However, we observed transgressive overyielding also under favorable conditions and in mixtures without legumes. With our investigation of the underlying mechanisms of the yield benefits we found both direct complementarities between crop species and indirect effects via other organisms. The former included chemical, spatial and temporal complementarity in N uptake, complementary root distribution leading to complementary water uptake, as well as spatial and temporal complementarity in light use. Among the indirect mechanisms we identified complementary suppression of weeds and more abundant plant growth-promoting microbes in crop mixtures, apart from complementarity in pest and disease suppression not yet studied in the Crop Diversity Experiment but demonstrated elsewhere. In consequence, the Crop Diversity Experiment supports not only the assumption that the ecological processes identified in biodiversity experiments also hold in crop systems, but that diversification of arable crop systems provides a valuable tool to sustainably produce food.","2023",NA,"10.1093/jpe/rtad016","WOS:001021850400003"

However, the impacts of arsenic on soil ammonia oxidizers communities remain unclear. Seven types of soil spiked with 0 or 100 mg arsenic per kg soil were incubated for 180 days and sampled at days 1, 15, 30, 90 and 180. The changes in the community composition and abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) were analyzed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) analysis, clone library sequencing, and quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting amoA gene. Results revealed considerable variations in the potential ammonia oxidation (PAO) rates in different soils, but soil PAO was not consistently significantly inhibited by arsenic, probably due to the low bioavailable arsenic contents or the existence of functional redundancy between AOB and AOA. The variations in AOB and AOA communities were closely associated with the changes in arsenic fractionations. The amoA gene abundances of AOA increased after arsenic addition, whereas AOB decreased, which corroborated the notion that AOA and AOB might occupy different niches in arsenic-contaminated soils. Phylogenetic analysis of amoA gene-encoded proteins revealed that all AOB clone sequences belonged to the genus Nitrosospira , among which those belonging to Nitrosospira cluster 3a were dominant. The main AOA sequence detected belonged to Thaumarchaeal Group 1.1b, which was considered to have a high ability to adapt to environmental changes.

Despite their abundant and functional importance, little is known about the patterns and mechanisms governing their community composition in intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams, which are the most common fluvial ecosystems globally. Thus far, it is known that aquatic fungi have evolved various life-history strategies and functional adaptations to cope with drying. Nevertheless, some of these adaptations have a metabolic cost and trade-offs between growth, reproduction and dispersion that may affect ecosystem functioning. Thus, understanding their eco-logical strategies along a gradient of drying is crucial to assess how species will respond to global change and to identify meaningful taxa to maintain ecosystem functions. By combining in situ hydrological information with a niche-based ap-proach, we analysed the role of drying in explaining the spatial segregation of fungal species, and we determined their specialization and affinity over a gradient of drying. In addition, we estimated whether species niches are good predic-tors of two key ecosystem processes: organic matter decomposition and fungal biomass accrual. Overall, we found that annual drying duration and frequency were the most influential variables upon species niche differentiation across the 15 studied streams. Our cluster analysis identified four drying niche-based groups with contrasting distributions and re-sponses over the drying gradient: drying-sensitive, partly tolerant to drying, generalist, and drying-resistant specialist. In addition, we found that species belonging to the drying specialist group showed a weak contribution to both ecosystem processes, suggesting trade-offs between drying resistance strategies and the energy invested in growth. Taken together, our results suggest that increased water scarcity may jeopardise the capacity of aquatic fungi to guarantee ecosystem functioning and to maintain biogeochemical cycles despite their ability to cope with drying.","2023","NOV 2022","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160374","WOS:000899386400017"

Nitrospira inopinata, which was obtained from an aquatic ecosystem, is the only pure comammox bacterial isolate reported so far. Ammonia oxidation kinetics of N. inopinata indicated that they prefer an oligotrophic lifestyle and may directly compete with ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), but representatives of comammox Nitrospira from terrestrial ecosystems are lacking. Current studies demonstrate that the functionally dominant comammox Nitrospira in terrestrial ecosystems are separated from most sequences obtained from aquatic and engineering systems. Clades A and B of comammox Nitrospira seemingly have different ecological preferences in soils, possibly due to their different ammonium uptake systems. Analyses of the evolutionary history indicate that some genes of comammox Nitrospira involved in ammonia oxidation could be laterally transferred from beta-ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). Some comammox Nitrospira species may have similar ecological preferences with AOB and be functionally active in the niches where nitrification was previously considered to be dominated by AOB. Taken together, this review summarizes the recent findings of the biogeographical distribution and ecological preference of comammox Nitrospira in large-scale soil surveys, the responses of comammox Nitrospira to nitrogen application in soil, and the putative mechanisms underpinning the ecological niche of terrestrial comammox Nitrospira. These studies from terrestrial ecosystems suggest that comammox Nitrospira are not strictly oligotrophic but both oligotrophic and copiotrophic with a broader ecological niche breadth.

To address this gap, we collected sediment samples along profiles ranging from 0 to 300 cm in depth at three locations within the middle segment of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), China. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analyses suggested that comammox bacteria were not only ubiquitous in deep sediments but also more abundant than ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). Ammonia monooxygenases subunit A (amoA) gene amplicon sequencing illuminated that comammox bacteria were more sensitive to sedimental depth compared to AOB and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), as evidenced by a more significant decline in community diversity and similarity over distance along sediment vertical profiles. Notably, we discovered that the amoA gene abundance, alpha-and beta-diversity of comammox bacteria exerted an essential contribution to potential nitrification rates according to random forest model. Phylogenetic analysis indicted that most comammox bacteria within sediment samples belonged to clade A.2. Intriguingly, the average relative abundance of comammox clade A.2 displayed a noteworthy rise with sediment depth, whereas clade A.1 demonstrated a converse pattern, unveiling distinct ecological niche adaptations of these two clades along the sediment profile. Ecological network analysis further revealed closer interactions between comammox bacteria and canonical ammonia oxidizers in the superficial layer (0-40 cm), with the network structure gradually simplifying from superficial to deep sediment (200-300 cm).

Here, we characterized the environmental thresholds and phylogenetic signals for the environmental adaptation of both abundant and rare microbial subcommunities via amplicon sequencing and metagenomic sequencing and explored their importance in sustaining soil multiple nutrient cycling in agricultural fields that were fertilized for two decades. The results showed that rare taxa exhibited narrower niche breadths and weaker phylogenetic signals than abundant species.

Though important in plant growth and development, phosphorus (P) nutrition studies in mixotrophic orchids have been limited to only a few orchid species and their fungal symbionts. For the first time, we demonstrate the role of a range of fungi in the acquisition and transport of inorganic P to four phylogenetically distinct green-leaved terrestrial orchid species (Diuris magnifica, Disa bracteata, Pterostylis sanguinea and Microtis media subsp. media) that naturally grow in P-impoverished soils. Methods Mycorrhizal P uptake and transfer to orchids was determined and visualized using agar microcosms with a diffusion barrier between P source (P-33 orthophosphate) and orchid seedlings, allowing extramatrical hyphae to reach the source. Key Results Extramatrical hyphae of the studied orchid species were effective in capturing and transporting inorganic P into the plant. Following 7 d of exposure, between 0.5 % (D. bracteata) and 47 % (D. magnifica) of the P supplied was transported to the plants (at rates between 0.001 and 0.097 fmol h(-1)). This experimental approach was capable of distinguishing species based on their P-foraging efficiency, and highlighted the role that fungi play in P nutrition during early seedling development. Conclusions Our study shows that orchids occurring naturally on P-impoverished soils can obtain significant amounts of inorganic P from their mycorrhizal partners, and significantly more uptake of P supplied than previously shown in other green-leaved orchids.

For the key primary producer in aquatic ecosystems, phytoplankton, several studies have focused on trait based functional diversity (FD) and the related functioning (e.g., resource use efficiency, RUE), and their linkages. However, investigations of the effects of environmental factors at different levels (e.g., land use, lake morphometry, climate and nutrients) on FD and RUE are sparse. We developed a data-driven-model framework to simultaneously elucidate the effects of multiple drivers on FD (functional diversity based on dendrograms, FDc and functional richness, FRic) and RUE (of nitrogen and phosphorus) of phytoplankton based on data from 68 Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau lakes, Southwest China. We found that the concentration of total phosphorus, which is mainly affected by land-use intensity and influenced by water depth, was the primary (positive) driver of changes in both FDc and FRic, while RUE was mainly explained by phytoplankton FD (i.e., FRic). These results indicate that water depth and land-use intensity influence indirectly phytoplankton FD and further regulate RUE. Moreover, nonlinear correlations of RUE with FRic were found, which may be caused by interspecific competition and niche differentiation of the phytoplankton community related to nutrient levels. Our finding may help managers to set trade-off targets between FD and RUE in lake ecosystems except for extremely polluted ones, in which the thresholds derived from the Bayesian network, of total phosphorus, total nitrogen and land-use intensity were approximately 0.04 mg/L, 0.50 mg/L and 244 (unitless), respectively. The probability of meeting the RUE objectives was lower in shallow lakes than in deep lakes, but for FRic the opposite was observed.","2022","APR 2022","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155303","WOS:000832996700008"

Using gene-centric metagenomics, we provided the first blueprints about comammox community, biogeography, and environmental drivers along a high-elevation (> 2000 m) river flowing through the largest city on the vulnerable Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Our study confirmed a wide presence and diversity of yet-uncultured comammox clade B across wet and dry seasons, with average 3.0 and 2.0 times as abundant as clade-A amoA genes in water and sediments, respectively. Species identified from freshwater and drinking water treatment plants dominated the comammox guilds (58-100%), suggesting this plateau river shared a similar comammox assemblage with the above habitat types. Compared with the urban area harboring more abundant canonical Nitrospira identified in wastewater (average 24%), the upstream suburban reach had a smaller human population but larger proportions of comammox in ammonia-oxidizing prokaryotes (24-72% of abundances) and Nitrospira sublineages I/II. Higher contents of nitrate and nitrite in water, and antibiotics in water and sediments, may restrain comammox niches in nitrifiers over the urban area. Further random forest analysis revealed that lincosamides and quinolones were the most important antibiotic predictors for the niche differentiations between comammox and canonical nitrifiers in water, while macrolides for those in sediments. Finally, by incubation experiments, we demonstrated higher activity contributions of benthic comammox in the suburban area (36.2-92.8% of potential ammonia-oxidation rates) than in the urban reach, and that the contribution variation had significant negative relations with macrolides and their major components. Overall, this study highlighted that anthropogenic activities hampered the advantage of riverine complete nitrifiers over the canonical two-step ones.","2022","OCT 2022","10.1016/j.watres.2022.119225","WOS:000880260700005"

However, the influence of soil chemical properties on the dynamics of functional N-genes and losses of N in maize (Zea mays L.) inter cropped with forage grasses under N fertilization is poorly understood. In this study, soil samples and N2O emissions were analyzed from a field experiment in which maize (fertilized or not with ammonium-based fertilizer) was intercropped with Guinea grass (M. maximus cv.

Soil N-cycle microorganisms [16S rRNA of bacteria and archaea, nifH (gene encoding N2-fixing bacteria), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA), nirS (encoding nitrite reductase), and nosZ (encoding nitrous oxide reductase)] were influenced by forage grass, N fertilization, and sampling time, but no evidence of biological nitrification inhibition was found. Palisade grass was associated with a higher abundance of nifH (7.0 x 105 gene copies g-1 soil, on average) in the absence of N compared with the other grasses (4.3 x 105 gene copies g-1 soil, on average). Nitrogen fertilization increased the abundance of AOB but not AOA. Furthermore, N2O flux was influenced by AOB, water-filled pore space, and N fertilization, whereas the cumulative N2O emission and fertilizer-induced emission factor (0.36%, on average) were not affected by the grasses. In conclusion, this study reveals the strong dominance of AOB under ammonium supply, potentially stimulating N2O emissions in maize-forage grass intercropping systems.","2022","APR 2022","10.1016/j.soilbio.2022.108655","WOS:000793214200004"

The effects of slash-and-burn agriculture and logging on aboveground plants and belowground microorganisms have been extensively studied, but research on plant-microbial interkingdom ecological networks is lacking. In this study, using old growth forest as a control, we used metagenomic data (ITS and 16S rRNA gene amplified sequences) and plant data to obtain interdomain species association patterns for three different soil disturbance types (slash-and-burn, clear cutting and selective cutting) in a tropical rainforest based on interdomain ecological network (IDEN) analysis. Results showed that the soil bacterial-fungal and plant-microbe ecological networks had different topological properties among the three forest disturbance types compared to old growth forest. More nodes, links, higher modularity and negative proportion were found in the selective cutting stand, indicating higher stability with increasing antagonistic relationships and niche differentiation. However, the area of slash-and-burn forest yield opposite results. Network module analysis indicated that different keystone species were found in the four forest types, suggesting alternative stable states among them. Different plant species had more preferential associations with specific fungal taxa than bacterial taxa at the genus level and plant-microbe associations lagged behind bacterial-fungal associations. Overall, compared with old growth forests, the bacterial-fungal and plant-microbe ecological networks in the slash-and-burn and clear cutting stands were simpler, while the network in the selective cutting stand was more complex.

In this study, we used replicated radiocarbon incubations of deep-sea hydrothermal fluids to investigate activity of each genus under three experimental conditions. To quantify genus-specific radiocarbon incorporation, we used newly designed oligonucleotide probes for Arcobacter, Sulfurimonas, and Sulfurovum to quantify their activity using catalyzed-reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH) combined with fluorescence-activated cell sorting. All three genera actively fixed CO2 in short-term (similar to 20 h) incubations, but responded differently to the additions of nitrate and oxygen. Oxygen additions had the largest effect on community composition, and caused a pronounced shift in community composition at the amplicon sequence variant (ASV) level after only 20 h of incubation. The effect of oxygen on carbon fixation rates appeared to depend on the initial starting community. The presented results support the hypothesis that these chemoautotrophic genera possess functionally redundant core metabolic capabilities, but also reveal finer-scale differences in growth likely reflecting adaptation of physiologically-distinct phylotypes to varying oxygen concentrations in situ. Overall, our study provides new insights into how oxygen controls community composition and total chemoautotrophic activity, and underscores how quickly deep-sea vent microbial communities respond to disturbances. IMPORTANCE Sulfidic environments worldwide are often dominated by sulfur-oxidizing, carbon-fixing Campylobacteria. Environmental factors associated with this group's dominance are now understood, but far less is known about the ecology and physiology of members of subgroups of chemoautotrophic Campylobacteria. In this study, we used a novel method to differentiate the genus-specific chemoautotrophic activity of three subtypes of Campylobacteria. In combination with evidence from microscopic counts, chemical consumption/production during incubations, and DNA-based measurements, our data show that oxygen concentration affects both community composition and chemoautotrophic function in situ.

Here, high-throughput sequencing technology and nontargeted metabolite profiling method were adopted to test the hypotheses regarding microbiome niche abundance, diversity, richness, function, and their association with bioactive compounds and soil edaphic factors within different ecological niches (leaf, stem, root, rhizosphere, and bulk soils) under Si amendment during cane growth were we addressed. Our results demonstrated that Si correspondingly increased sugarcane theoretical production and yield, and remarkably enhanced soil nutrient status, especially Si, AP, and AK. It was also observed that bacterial diversity demonstrated tissue-dependent distribution patterns, with the bulk soil, rhizosphere soil, and root endosphere revealing the highest amount of bacterial diversity compared with the stem and leaf tissues. Moreover, Si exhibited the advantage of considerably promoting bacterial abundance in the various plant compartments. Co-occurrence interactions demonstrated that Si application has the potential to increase bacterial diversity maintenance, coexistence, and plant-soil systems bacteria connections, thereby increasing the functional diversity in the various plant tissues, which, in turn, could trigger positive growth effects in plants. Network analysis further revealed that metabolite profiles exhibited a strong association with bacterial community structures. It was also revealed that Si content had a considerable positive association with bacterial structures. Our findings suggest that the dynamic changes in microbe's community composition in different plant and soil compartments were compartment-specific.

Rapid increases in benthic adults result from fast recruitment-stock feedbacks following increased recruitment. Slower population declines in the decreased productivity region may result from aging but still reproducing adults that provide temporary insurance against population collapses. Thus, in this region of the ocean where surface waters have been cooling down, climate change is transforming coastal pelagic and benthic ecosystems through altering primary productivity, which seems to propagate up the food web at rates modulated by stock-recruitment feedbacks and storage effects.

Calcareous soil under rice cropping is characterized by high nitrification potential, N loss risk, and low FRE. Application of SNIs may stimulate NH3 volatilization in high pH soils and the effects of SNIs on FRE are not always positive. BNIs have many advantages over SNIs. Whether combined application of BNI, UI, and BC that can result in a synergistic effect of improving FRE and decreasing N loss in a calcareous soil under rice cropping worth investigating. In this study, we conducted pot experiments to investigate the effects of single and co-application of BNI (methyl 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) propionate or MHPP, 500 mg kg(-1) soil), UI (N-(n-butyl), thiophosphoric triamide or NBPT, 2% of urea-N), or BC (wheat straw, 0.5% (w/w)) with chemical fertilizer on NH3 volatilization, N2O emission, N leaching, crop N uptake, and FRE in a calcareous soil under rice cropping. Our results demonstrated that those NMMs could mitigate NH3 volatilization by 12.5%-26.5%, N2O emission by 62.7%-73.5%, and N leaching loss by 17.5%-49.0%. However, BNI might have a risk of increasing NH3 (5.98%) volatilization loss. Among those NMMs, double inhibitors (BNI plus UI) yielded a synergistic effect that could mitigate N loss to the maximum extent and effectively improve FRE by 25.4%. The mechanisms of the above effects could be partly ascribed to the niche differentiation between the abundance of AOA and AOB and the changed community structure of AOB, which could further influence nitrification and N fate.

Taxon-specific growth rates in mixed assemblages would be useful for attributing biogeochemical processes to individual species and understanding niche differentiation among related clades, such as found in Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus. We tested three novel DNA sequencing-based methods (iRep, bPTR, and GRiD) for evaluating the growth of light-synchronized Synechococcus cultures under different light intensities and temperatures. In vivo fluorescence and cell cycle analysis were used to obtain standard estimates of growth rate for comparison with those of the sequence-based methods (SBM). None of the SBM values were correlated with growth rates calculated by standard techniques despite the fact that all three SBM were correlated with the percentage of cells in S phase (DNA replication) over the diel cycle. Inaccuracy in determining the time of maximum DNA replication is unlikely to account entirely for the absence of a relationship between SBM and growth rate, but the fact that most microbes in the surface ocean exhibit some degree of diel cyclicity is a caution for application of these methods. SBM correlate with DNA replication but cannot be interpreted quantitatively in terms of growth rate. IMPORTANCE Small but abundant, cyanobacterial strains such as the photosynthetic Synechococcus spp. are important because they contribute significantly to primary productivity in the ocean. These bacteria generate oxygen and provide biologically available carbon, which is essential for organisms at higher trophic levels. The small size and diversity of natural microbial assemblages mean that taxon-specific activities (e.g., growth rate) are difficult to obtain in the field. It has been suggested that sequence-based methods (SBM) may be able to solve this problem. We find, however, that SBM can detect DNA replication and are correlated with phases of the cell cycle but cannot be interpreted in terms of absolute growth rate for Synechococcus cultures growing under a day-night cycle, like that experienced in the ocean.","2022",NA,"10.1128/AEM.01743-21","WOS:000748722200021"

Furthermore, both AOA and AOB are probably targets for NIs, but a quantitative synthesis is lacking to identify the indicator microbe  as the best predictor of NI efficiency under different environmental conditions. In this present study, a meta-analysis to assess the response characteristics of AOB and AOA to NI application was conducted and the relationship between NI efficiency and the AOA and AOB amoA genes response under different conditions was evaluated. The dataset consisted of 48 papers (214 observations). This study showed that NIs on average reduced 58.1% of N2O emissions and increased 71.4% of soil NH4+ concentrations, respectively. When 3, 4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) was applied with both organic and inorganic fertilizers in alkaline medium soils, it had higher efficacy of decreasing N2O emissions than in acidic soils. The abundance of AOB amoA genes was dramatically reduced by about 50% with NI application in most soil types. Decrease in N2O emissions with NI addition was significantly correlated with AOB changes (R-2 = 0.135, n = 110, P < 0.01) rather than changes in AOA, and there was an obvious correlation between the changes in NH4+ concentration and AOB amoA gene abundance after NI application (R-2 = 0.037, n = 136, P = 0.014).

Clones of Syntrophorhabdaceae and Cryptanaerobacter were observed to be responsible for phenol degradation. For accurate taxonomic assignment of Cryptanaerobacter clones, phylogenetic analysis using nearly full-length 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences was necessary. Three oligonucleotide probes were designed to detect the following three taxonomic groups: Syntrophorhabdaceae, Cryptanaerobacter, and Syntrophus. FISH analysis of thin sections of anaerobic granules showed a random distribution of bacteria and archaea. However, a well-defined distribution of Syntrophorhabdaceae, Cryptanaerobacter, and Syntrophus was observed. Cryptanaerobacter and Syntrophus were found on the outer layer of the granules and were closely associated with each other, while Syntrophorhabdaceae was located in the deeper part of the granules. Such specific distribution of the bacteria is most likely due to their metabolic association and affinity for the substrate. Phenol degradation in the granular sludge was observed to be carried out in the following way. First, Cryptanaerobacter converts phenol to benzoate, which is then degraded by Syntrophus into acetate. This syntrophic degradation of phenol occurs near the surface of the granule, where the phenol concentration is high. In the deeper part of the granule, where the phenol concentration is lower, Syntrophorhabdaceae degrades phenol into acetate. We observed that Syntrophorhabdaceae is less likely to produce benzoate as an intermediate to feed the neighboring organisms, which contradicts the theories presented by previous studies.(c) 2021 THE AUTHORS.

The awareness has led to increased efforts to understand how contemporary environmental context modifies BEF relationships, but the role of historical context, and the mechanisms by which it may influence biodiversity effects, remains poorly understood. We examined how historical context alters plant diversity-community productivity relationships via plant species interactions in alpine grassland. We also tested how historical context modifies interactions between plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, which can potentially mediate the above processes. We studied biodiversity effects on plant community productivity at two grassland sites with different histories related to grazing intensity-heavy versus light livestock grazing-but similar current management. We assembled experimental communities of identical species composition with plants from each of the two sites in disturbed soil from a contemporary heavily grazed grassland, ranging in species richness from one to two, three and six species. Moreover, we carried out a mycorrhizal hyphae-exclusion experiment to test how plant interactions with AM fungi influence plant responses to historical context. We detected a significantly positive diversity-productivity relationship that was driven by complementarity effects in communities composed of plants from the site without heavy-grazing history, but no such relationship in plant communities composed of plants from the site with heavy-grazing history. Plants from the site with heavy-grazing history had increased competitive ability and increased yields in low-diversity communities but disrupted complementarity effects in high-diversity communities. Moreover, plants of one species from the site with heavy-grazing history benefitted more from AM fungal communities than did plants from the site without such history. Synthesis. Using the same experimental design and species, communities assembled by plants from two sites with different historical contexts showed different plant diversity-community productivity relationships. Our results suggest that historical context can alter plant diversity-community productivity relationships via plant species interactions and potentially plant-soil interactions. Therefore, considering historical contexts of ecological communities is of importance for advancing our understanding of long-term impacts of anthropogenic disturbance on ecosystem functioning.","2022","JUN 2022","10.1111/1365-2745.13943","WOS:000814393900001"

Spatiotemporal patterns of tick abundance are heterogeneous, so its determinants at small spatial scales need to be understood to reduce their negative effects on hosts. Current knowledge of these determinants is scarce, especially in Mediterranean environ-ments, limiting the possibilities for designing efficient tick control strategies. With the goal of unravelling tick abun-dance determinants and informing new tick management strategies, we estimated tick burdens on 1965 wild ungulates in Donana National Park, Spain, annually between 2010 and 2020. Under the hypothesis of a predominant host influence on tick abundance, we modelled the burdens of Rhipicephalus annulatus, Hyalomma lusitanicum, and Ixodes ricinus with relevant predictors grouped into four factors: i) environment; ii) host population; iii) host individual; and iv) land-use. Generalized linear mixed models with a zero-inflated negative binomial distribution were built. Additionally, we analysed the differential contribution to abundance of each factor by deviance partitioning. We finally estimated the similarity in the environmental space of tick species by analysing their niche overlap with the environmental principal component analysis method. Our work hypothesis was confirmed for R. annulatus and H. lusitanicum, but we found that tick abundance at a fine spatial scale is jointly driven by multiple drivers, including all four factors considered in this study. This result points out that understanding the demography of ticks is a complex multifactorial issue, even at small spatial scales. We found no niche differences between the three tick species at the study spatial scale, thus showing similar host and environmental dependencies. Overall results identify that host aggregation areas displaying environ-mentally favourable traits for ticks are relevant tick and vector-borne pathogen transmission hotspots.

Using the in-situ stable N isotopelabeling technique, we explored the preference of plants in taking up N of different chemical forms along an experimental gradient of grazing intensity in a semi-arid grassland in Inner Mongolia. 15N-labelled nitrate (NO3- ), ammonium (NH4+) and glycine solutions were injected into the soil under nil (G0, as a control), light (G1) and heavy grazing (G2) grassland plots in June and August. Uptake of these three N forms was determined for three dominant plants, Leymus chinensis, Stipa grandis and Cleistogenes squarrosa. L. chinensis had the highest N acquisition capacity. Regardless of species, N absorption was higher in August than in June. While all three plant species absorbed glycine-N, they preferentially absorbed N in its inorganic forms (NO3- -N + NH4+-N), with NO3- -N having the highest uptake. Irrespective of grazing intensity, during peak growth (August) all three plant species preferred to absorb NO3- -N (the dominant N form) than NH4+-N or glycine-N. In contrast, in June plants differed in their preferred form of N uptake depending on the grazing treatment. Under heavy grazing (G2), all plants preferentially absorbed NO3- -N. Under light grazing (G1), all plants absorbing all three N chemical forms with no significant difference. Under no grazing (G0), L. chinensis preferentially absorbed NO3- -N but otherwise there was no significant effect of grazing intensity on the preferred form of N. Our results indicate that the three species of plants that we observed altered their N-uptake preference in response to grazing intensity differently in the early growth and vigorous growth stages. Plant N niche differentiation in time, space and chemical N forms needs to be explored systematically in future studies to aid understand of grazing effects on N processes in grassland ecosystem.","2022","MAR 2022","10.1016/j.agee.2022.107959","WOS:000797594800003"

Whether intensive management of Eucalyptus plantations affects this variation should also be concerned. To investigate the mechanisms underlying bacterial changes in different ecological niches of Eucalyptus and the stability of bacterial communities after continuous high-intensity planting of Eucalyptus, we studied the effects of long-term plantation of Eucalyptus on the structure, assembly patterns, and interactions of the bacterial community. Woodlands that planted with Eucalyptus urophylla S.T. Blake x Eucalyptus grandis Hill ex Maiden (Eucalyptus urograndis, hereafter E. urograndis) in three generations (10 years after planting) were selected for study, and the woodlands were cleared and replanted with E. urograndis.

We detected structural variation in the soil and endophytic bacterial communities as well as variation in community assembly. Stochastic processes made large contributions to the assembly of highly abundant soil bacterial communities, as well as low-abundant endophytic bacterial communities of the branches and leaves (especially leaves), and this pattern may be strongly related to the ecological niches of the bacteria.

We examined aerobic methanotrophic bacteria over all seasons for 5 years in this dimictic lake. Methanotrophs comprised up to 58% of all bacterial reads in 165 rRNA gene amplicon sequencing analyses (median 2.8%), and up to 2.7 x 10(4) cells mL(-1) of water (median 0.5 x 10(3)) based on qPCR of pmoA genes. Methanotrophic activity and populations in the lake water were highest during fall turnover and remained high through the winter ice-covered period into spring turnover. They declined during summer stratification, especially in the epilimnion. Three methanotroph genera (Methylobacter, Methylovulum, and Methyloparacoccus) cycled seasonally, based on both relative and absolute abundance measurements. Methylobacter and Methylovulum populations peaked in winter/spring, when methane oxidation activity was psychrophilic. Methyloparacoccus populations increased in the water column through summer and fall, when methane oxidation was mesophilic, and also predominated in the underlying tailings sediment. Other, less abundant genera grew primarily during summer, possibly due to distinct CH4/O-2 microniches created during thermal stratification. These data are consistent with temporal and spatial niche differentiation based on temperature, CH4 and O-2. This pit lake displays methane cycling and methanotroph population dynamics similar to natural boreal lakes. IMPORTANCE The study examined methanotrophic bacteria in an industrial end pit lake, combining molecular DNA methods (both quantitative and descriptive) with biogeochemical measurements. The lake was sampled over 5 years, in all four seasons, as often as weekly, and included sub-ice samples. The resulting multiseason and multiyear data set is unique in its size and intensity, and allowed us to document clear and consistent seasonal patterns of growth and decline of three methanotroph genera (Methylobacter, Methylovulum, and Methyloparacoccus). Laboratory experiments suggested that one major control of this succession was niche partitioning based on temperature. The study helps to understand microbial dynamics in engineered end pit lakes, but we propose that the dynamics are typical of boreal stratified lakes and widely applicable in microbial ecology and limnology. Methane-oxidizing bacteria are important model organisms in microbial ecology and have implications for global climate change.","2022",NA,"10.1128/aem.01455-21","WOS:000758411000002"

They are safer than commonly used plastic packaging materials. But due to the presence of carbon sources like cellulose and starch in paper, various pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbes can grow well in them. The migration of microorganisms or their spores from paper to food may cause serious health hazards. Taking consumer concerns into picture, the regulatory authorities should come up for food packaging standards with regard to microbial limits of paper used in food packaging. This study pinpoints the correct approach, that is, the disintegration method in comparison to direct plating in evaluating the microbial load of 14 different samples of paper by demonstrating the limitations of methods that were eliminated. The samples were also tested for storage effect on microbial load and found to have significant reduction in bacterial load during storage at 4 degrees C, but for fungi, it remained nearly unchanged. Further identification of predominating microbes was performed, and conclusions have been drawn on the presence of harmful and harmless species in the samples of paper. It was found that all the identified fungi are mycotoxin producing and may lead to illness of the consumer. Unlike fungi, dominating bacterial strains were found to be non-harmful for food packaging purposes and ultimately for human use.

The effect of N fertilizer rates on AOA and AOB communities is less studied in the wheat-fallow system from semi-arid areas.

This study showed that the grain yield of wheat reached the maximum at 105 kg N ha(-1) (49% higher than control), and no further significant increase was observed at higher N rates. With the increase of N, AOA abundance decreased in a regular trend from 4.88 x 10(7) to 1.05 x 10(7) copies g(-1) dry soil, while AOB abundance increased from 3.63 x 10(7) up to a maximum of 8.24 x 10(7) copies g(-1) dry soil with the N105 treatment (105 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)). Application rates of N fertilizer had a more significant impact on the AOB diversity than on AOA diversity, and the highest AOB diversity was found under the N105 treatment in this weak alkaline soil. The predominant phyla of AOA and AOB were Thaumarchaeota and Proteobacteria, respectively, and higher N treatment (N210) resulted in a significant decrease in the relative abundance of genus Nitrosospira. In addition, AOA and AOB communities were significantly associated with grain yield of wheat, soil potential nitrification activity (PNA), and some soil physicochemical parameters such as pH, NH4-N, and NO3-N. Among them, soil moisture was the most influential edaphic factor for structuring the AOA community and NH4-N for the AOB community.

Crop rotation, no-till, and cover cropping are feasible conservation agronomic strategies used to prevent N losses to the environment, though their effect on soil microbial N cycling at the field scale remains relatively unknown. Our goal was to determine the effect of crop rotation (continuous corn [Zea mays L.], CCC; and continuous soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], SSS), tillage (no-till, NT; and chisel tillage, T), and cover crops (cover crop mixture, CC; and no cover crop, NCC) on the quantification of functional genes related to the N cycle from different times throughout the growing season. The study was conducted during the growing season of the cash crops following the first season of cover crops introduced after 23 years of management. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) techniques, we quantified nifH (N-2 fixation), amoA (nitrification) and nirK, nirS, and nosZ (denitrification). Our results show that CCC increased nitrous oxide emissions by 44% compared to SSS and reduced soil pH by nearly 1 unit. The reduction in soil pH, coupled with an increase in fertilizer-derived ammonium, caused ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nirK copy numbers to increase. The SSS rotation showed opposite results. Bacterial denitrification via the nirK pathway was likely the N cycle mechanism behind nitrous oxide emissions in CCC. The cover crop mixture of cereal rye [Secale cereale L.] and hairy vetch [Vicia villosa Roth] reduced soil nitrate levels, though they did increase nitrous oxide emissions, likely due to priming and the inclusion of a legume in the cover crop mixture. Nitrous oxide emissions were affected by sampling date, crop rotation, and cover crop use, suggesting management factors that add abundantly available N alter the microbial N cycle directly or indirectly. Chisel tillage increased the abundance of all N cycle genes compared to no-till. Together, our work adds further insight into the microbial N cycle, especially nitrous oxide evolution, from three common conservation agricultural management practices, contributing to our understanding of key soil biogeochemical processes.","2022",NA,"10.3389/fagro.2022.833338","WOS:001005881500001"

Methods We sampled soil and roots from a 26-year-old field experiment comprising 16 replicated treatments, in which we manipulated tillage intensity (moldboard vs. chisel plow), fertilization (organic vs. mineral) and crop rotation (continuous barley vs barley-forage rotations) in a factorial design (N = 64). We measured AM fungal community-aggregated traits, namely the abundance of vesicles, arbuscules, extraradical mycelium (ERM) and spores. We characterized root-borne and soil-borne AM communities using Illumina sequencing. Results Crop rotation was the main factor controlling AM fungal traits, with more arbuscules and ERM found in forage rotation plots, and more vesicles and spores found in continuous barley plots. Members of the Glomeraceae family were preferentially associated with continuous barley whereas the Gigasporaceae and Diversisporaceae families were overrepresented in the first stage of crop rotation. Trait-based and phylogenic filtering of AM fungal communities allowed us to speculate on different life history strategies among taxonomic families. AM community structure in soil responded to fertilizer type, whereas root-borne communities responded to crop rotation. We found the first evidence of temporal niche partitioning as a potential driver of coexistence among AM fungal taxa, resulting in higher species richness (i.e. storage effects). Conclusions Crop rotation scheme strongly influences functional traits and coexistence of AM fungi, more so than soil disturbance intensity or fertilization regime. Future work is required to understand the implications of these shifts in AM fungal community structure for crop productivity.","2022","NOV 2021","10.1007/s11104-021-05155-w","WOS:000720215200001"

However, our understanding of Nitrospira distribution and their response to dynamic environmental parameters is still limited in the subterranean estuary (STE), a special environment of the mixed zone between land and sea. In this study, Nitrospira communities were collected within 5-10 cm depth intervals of sediments with the physiochemical gradients along the transections of the Daya Bay (DYB) from the landward member to the seaward member. The abundance, community structure of Nitrospira, and their potentially influencing environmental factors were investigated using Q-PCR, the high throughput sequencing targeting Nitrospira nxrB gene, and biostatistics analyses. The abundance of Nitrospira showed uniform distribution along the transections, but significantly decreasing variations were observed from the surface (<20 cm) to the bottom (>20 cm) of sediments. The community diversity and structure of Nitrospira also displayed a remarkable vertical distribution in the DYB (STE), although no significant differences were observed along the transections of STE. Nitrospira marina (N. marina) predominated in the sediments, Candidatus Nitrospira bockiana (Ca. N. bockiana), and Candidatus Nitrospira defluvii (Ca. N. defluvii) were the main Nitrospira species, and Candidatus Nitrospira lenta (Ca. N. lenta) and Nitrospira japonica (N. japonica) also existed with relatively low abundance in the DYB (STE). These findings revealed that Nitrospira species (Ca. N. defluvii, Ca. N. lenta, and N. japonica) derived from activated sludge was also widespread in natural habitats and deduced that the STE may be affected by the pollution derived from terrigenous human activities. The statistical analysis combined with the STE dynamic variation indicated that dissolved organic carbon (DOC), salinity, and ammonium along the sediment depths attributed to the vertical community distribution of the Nitrospira species. In summary, the vertical distribution of Nitrospira and their response to the dynamic physicochemical parameters imply their important role in the nitrite oxidation of the STE and provide insights into the niche differentiation and diversely physiologic metabolism of NOB.","2022",NA,"10.3389/fmars.2022.822939","WOS:000764538800001"

Unfortunately, the lack of long-term continuous agricultural field sites in North America has left gaps in our understanding of agricultural management on biogeochemical processes and their controlling microbiota. Nitrification, ammonium oxidation by bacteria and archaea, is a critical control point in terrestrial nitrogen fluxes by oxidizing cationic ammonium to anionic nitrate, promoting nitrate leaching. Moreover, nitrous oxide is produced during nitrification, contributing to massive nitrous oxide emissions from fertilized agroecosystems. Nitrification is sensitive to many macro and micro-ecological filters, as nitrifiers are obligate aerobes and are sensitive to numerous non-growth substrates and metal ions. This study sought to understand the long-term implications of various rotation and fertilizer regimes on nitrification potential and nitrifying bacterial communities in the Morrow Plots (Urbana, IL). The Morrow Plots was established in 1876 and are the longest continuous field experiments in North America, making it the only site in America capable of assessing the impact of over 140 years of agricultural management on nitrification. The Morrow Plots contrasts fertilizer (manure, inorganic, unfertilized) and rotation (continuous corn, corn-soy, corn-oat alfalfa), allowing us to explore how conventional vs. regenerative agriculture practices impact nitrifier communities. The results of this study suggest that fertilizer and rotation interact to promote distinct bacterial nitrifier communities. Nitrification potential is highest in manure corn-oat-alfalfa plots, suggesting ammonium availability is not solely responsible for active nitrifier communities. Various soil chemical variables, like CEC, Mg, and Ca, significantly influenced nitrifier community beta-diversity, using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, suggesting long-term accumulation of specific cations diverge microbial community assembly. While this study only uses nitrification potential enzyme activity instead of isotope analyses, it sheds light on the importance of various physiochemical drivers on nitrification potential and communities. The results support the need for a more precise exploration of the mechanisms controlling field-scale nitrification rates over large temporal scales. Put together, this study supports the importance of long-term field sites for understanding agricultural manipulations of microbial biogeochemical cycling and sheds light on the micronutrients influencing nitrifier communities and potential activity.","2022",NA,"10.3389/fsoil.2022.838497","WOS:001091834500001"

The nitrogen budget estimate shows a deficit of 4.7 +/- 2.4 Tg N yr(-1), suggesting a significant role of dissolved organic nitrogen remineralization in fuelling ecosystem processes. Unravelling the process of remineralization leading to increasing concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in coastal ecosystems such as in mangroves require a better understanding of the composition of functional resident bacterioplankton communities. Bacterioplankton communities were elucidated from eight stations along different estuaries spanning west to east of northeast coastal Bay of Bengal to understand the influence of DIN on shaping these communities. The eight stations were differentiated into 'low' and 'high' DIN stations based on DIN concentration, with five stations with High DIN concentration (>45 mu M) and three stations with Low DIN concentration (mu M). The V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA was amplified and sequenced to elucidate resident bacterioplankton community structure from environmental DNA. Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes were the dominant bacterioplankton phyla across all stations. Nitrogen-fixing groups such as Nitrospirae, Lentisphaerae, Chloroflexi, and Planctomycetes make up about 1% of the bacterioplankton communities. Abundances of Spirochaetes and Tenericutes showed a positive correlation with DIN. Pseudomonadales, Alteromonadales, and Desulfovibrionales were found to distinctly vary in abundance between Low and High DIN stations. Predicted metagenomic profiles from taxonomically derived community structures indicated bacterial nitrate-nitrite reductase to be negatively correlated with prevalent DIN concentration in High DIN stations but positively correlated in Low DIN stations. This trend was also consistent for genes encoding for nitrate/nitrite response regulators and transporter proteins. This indicates the need to delineate functional bacterioplankton community structures to better understand their role in influencing rates and fluxes of nitrogen within mangroves.","2022",NA,"10.1088/2515-7620/ac5a69","WOS:000776457100001"

It is also well known that heterotrophs and chemoautotrophs dominate the hadal and abyssal pelagic zones, respectively. Here, a metagenomic investigation was conducted on sediment samples obtained from the abyssal-hadal transition zone in the Mariana Trench to gain a better understanding of the general diversity and potential function of the core microbiome in this zone. A high level of cosmopolitanism existed in the core microbiome referred from a high community similarity among different stations. Niche differentiation along the fine-scale of different sediment layers was observed, especially for major archaeal groups, largely due to sediment depth and the source of organic matter. A prevalence of nitrogen biogeochemical cycles driven by various nitrifying groups with the capability of dark carbon fixation in the abyssal-hadal biosphere was also demonstrated. The predominance of heterotrophic over chemolithoautotrophic pathways in this transition zone was found, and a high abundance of genes related to respiration and carbon fixation (i.e., the intact Calvin and rTCA cycles) were detected as well, which might reflect the intensive microbial activities known to occur in this deep biosphere. The presence of those metabolic processes and associated microbes were reflected by functional and genetic markers generated from the metagenomic data in the current study.

However, great attention is required in choosing the optimal ratio of the components for the mixtures and other agronomic practices (including N fertilization and stage of harvest), because they can sharply change the forage composition and quality. To fill this gap, the present research compared the herbage and silage qualities and key fermentative and nutritional traits of biomasses obtained by: (i) five mixtures (i.e., 100:0; 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100) of hybrid barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and faba bean (Vicia faba var. minor); (ii) two N barley fertilization rates (0 vs. 140 kg N ha(-1)); and (iii) three stages of harvest (milky, early dough and soft dough). We found that the presence of faba bean improved the forage quality, either herbage or silage, through different mechanisms. In the herbage mixtures, faba bean inclusion increased crude protein (CP), and, when compared to the fertilized barley, also water-soluble sugar (WSCs) concentration, with small effects on the relative feed values (RFV) and total digestible nutrients (TDN). In the silage, the higher the faba bean share in the mixture, the higher the RFV, the non-fibrous carbohydrates, and total and lactic acid concentrations, and the lower the pH and the hemicellulose and cellulose concentrations, particularly at the early and mid stages of harvest. These improvements were likely due to the high ability of faba bean to attain a vegetative status (i.e., low dry matter concentration) by the end of the cropping season, and to improve the organic acid production. Our results suggest that the inclusion of faba bean in a barley-based silage system can widen the window for silage harvesting, thanks to its ability to sustain the fermentation process, despite a lower WSC to CP ratio compared to the unfertilized barley. These results occurred almost irrespectively of the faba bean share in the mixture and barley fertilization. This implies that when designing intercrop mixtures, the effect of crop densities on yield should be considered more than on quality.","2022",NA,"10.3390/agronomy12081790","WOS:000846329200001"

We found that the community composition was distinct between hypoxia and non-hypoxia regions, while Thaumarchaeota and Bathyarchaeota dominated in non-hypoxia and hypoxia samples, respectively. Water hypoxia (DO < 2 mg/L) is a growing global environmental concern that has the potential to significantly influence not only the aquatic ecosystem but also the benthic sedimentary ecosystem. The Changjiang River Estuary hypoxia, classified as one of the world's largest seasonal hypoxic water basins, has been reported to be expanding rapidly in recent decades. However, the microbial community dynamics and responses to this water hypoxia are still unclear. In this study, we examined the abundance, community composition, and distribution of sedimentary archaea, one important component of microbial communities in the Changjiang River Estuary and the East China Sea (ECS). Our results indicated that Thaumarchaeota and Bathyarchaeota were predominant archaeal groups in these research areas, with their 16S rRNA gene abundance ranged from 8.55 x 10(6) to 7.51 x 10(8) and 3.18 x 10(5) to 1.11 x 10(8) copies/g, respectively.

At the microhabitat scale, they also host hypolithic communities that live under semitranslucent stones. Both environmental niches experience exposure to extreme conditions such as high UV radiation, desiccation, temperature fluctuations, and resource limitation. However, hypolithic communities are somewhat protected from extremes relative to biocrust communities. Conditions are otherwise similar, so comparing them can answer outstanding questions regarding adaptations to environmental extremes. Using metagenomic sequencing, we assessed the functional potential of dryland soil communities and identified the functional underpinnings of ecological niche differentiation in biocrusts versus hypoliths. We also determined the effect of the anchoring photoautotroph (moss or cyanobacteria). Genes and pathways differing in abundance between biocrusts and hypoliths indicate that biocrust communities adapt to the higher levels of UV radiation, desiccation, and temperature extremes through an increased ability to repair damaged DNA, sense and respond to environmental stimuli, and interact with other community members and the environment. Intracellular competition appears to be crucial to both communities, with biocrust communities using the Type VI Secretion System (T6SS) and hypoliths favoring a diversity of antibiotics. The dominant primary producer had a reduced effect on community functional potential compared with niche, but an abundance of genes related to monosaccharide, amino acid, and osmoprotectant uptake in moss-dominated communities indicates reliance on resources provided to heterotrophs by mosses. Our findings indicate that functional traits in dryland communities are driven by adaptations to extremes and we identify strategies that likely enable survival in dryland ecosystems. IMPORTANCE Biocrusts serve as a keystone element of desert and dryland ecosystems, stabilizing soils, retaining moisture, and serving as a carbon and nitrogen source in oligotrophic environments. Biocrusts cover approximately 12% of the Earth's terrestrial surface but are threatened by climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. Given their keystone role in ecosystem functioning, loss will have wide-spread consequences. Biocrust microbial constituents must withstand polyextreme environmental conditions including high UV exposure, desiccation, oligotrophic conditions, and temperature fluctuations over short time scales. By comparing biocrust communities with co-occurring hypolithic communities (which inhabit the ventral sides of semitranslucent stones and are buffered from environmental extremes), we identified traits that are likely key adaptations to extreme conditions. These include DNA damage repair, environmental sensing and response, and intracellular competition. Comparison of the two niches, which differ primarily in exposure levels to extreme conditions, makes this system ideal for understanding how functional traits are structured by the environment.","2022","JUL 2022","10.1128/msystems.01419-21","WOS:000827874100001"

Standardized approaches need to be adopted to increase the reliability and reproducibility of environmental amplicon-sequencing-based data sets. Until recently, the de facto method for short-read-based amplicon reconstruction was a sequence similarity threshold approach (operational taxonomic units [OTUs]). This has changed with the amplicon sequence variant (ASV) method where distributions are fitted to abundance profiles of individual genes using a noise-error model. While OTU-based approaches are still useful for 16S rRNA/18S rRNA genes, where thresholds of 97% to 99% are used, their use for functional genes is still debatable as there is no consensus on clustering thresholds. Here, we compare OTU- and ASV-based reconstruction approaches and taxonomy assignment methods, the naive Bayesian classifier (NBC) and Bayesian lowest common ancestor (BLCA) algorithm, using a functional gene data set from the microbial nitrogen-cycling community in the Brouage mudflat (France). A range of OTU similarity thresholds and ASVs were used to compare amoA (ammonia-oxidizing archaea [AOA] and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria [AOB]), nxrB, nirS, nirK, and nrfA communities between differing sedimentary structures. Significant effects of the sedimentary structure on weighted UniFrac (WUniFrac) distances were observed for AOA amoA when using ASVs, an OTU at a threshold of 97% sequence identity (OTU-97%), and OTU-85%; AOB amoA when using OTU-85%; and nirS when using ASV, OTU-90%, and OTU-85%. For AOB amoA, significant effects of the sedimentary structures on UniFrac distances were observed when using OTU-97% but not ASVs, and the inverse was found for nrfA. Interestingly, conclusions drawn for nirK and nxrB were consistent between amplicon reconstruction methods. We also show that when the sequences in the reference database are related to the environment in question, the BLCA algorithm leads to more phylogenetically relevant classifications. However, when the reference database contains sequences more dissimilar to the ones retrieved, the NBC obtains more information. IMPORTANCE Several analysis pipelines are available to microbial ecologists to process amplicon sequencing data, yet to date, there is no consensus as to the most appropriate method, and it becomes more difficult for genes that encode a specific function (functional genes). Standardized approaches need to be adopted to increase the reliability and reproducibility of environmental amplicon-sequencing-based data sets. In this paper, we argue that the recently developed ASV approach offers a better opportunity to achieve such standardization than OTUs for functional genes.

Therefore, a comprehensive reevaluation is needed to establish a common understanding of this genus, in terms of both naming and basic conserved physiological traits. Here, we provide this reassessment using a comparison of genome, ppk1, and 16S rRNA gene-based approaches from comprehensive data sets. We identified 15 novel species, along with Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis, Candidatus Accumulibacter delftensis, and Candidatus Accumulibacter aalborgensis. To compare the species in situ, we designed new speciesspecific fluorescence in situ hybridization (ASH) probes and revealed their morphology and arrangement in activated sludge. Based on the MiDAS global survey, Ca. Accumulibacter species were widespread in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with phosphorus removal, indicating process design as a major driver for their abundance. Genome mining for PAO-related pathways and FISH-Raman microspectroscopy confirmed the potential for PAO metabolism in all Co. Accumulibacter species, with detection in situ of the typical PAO storage polymers. Genome annotation further revealed differences in the nitrate/nitrite reduction pathways. This provides insights into the niche differentiation of these lineages, potentially explaining their coexistence in the same ecosystem while contributing to overall phosphorus and nitrogen removal. IMPORTANCE Candidatus Accumulibacter is the most studied PAO, with a primary role in biological nutrient removal. However, the species-level taxonomy of this lineage is convoluted due to the use of different phylogenetic markers or genome sequencing approaches. Here, we redefined the phylogeny of these organisms, proposing a comprehensive approach which could be used to address the classification of other diverse and uncultivated lineages. Using genome-resolved phylogeny, compared to phylogeny based on the 16S rRNA gene and other phylogenetic markers, we obtained a higher-resolution taxonomy and established a common understanding of this genus. Furthermore, genome mining of genes and pathways of interest, validated in situ by application of a new set of FISH probes and Raman microspectroscopy, provided additional high-resolution metabolic insights into these organisms.","2022","APR 2022","10.1128/msystems.00016-22","WOS:000787835300001"

However, the diversity and prevalence of anammox bacteria in the terrestrial subsurface-a typically oligotrophic environment-are little understood. To determine the distribution and activity of anammox bacteria across a range of aquifer lithologies and physicochemistries, we analyzed 16S rRNA genes and quantified hydrazine synthase genes and transcripts sampled from 59 groundwater wells and metagenomes and metatranscriptomes from an oxic-to-dysoxic subset. Data indicate that anammox and anammox-associated bacteria (class Candidatus Brocadiae) are prevalent in the aquifers studied, and that anammox community composition is strongly differentiated by dissolved oxygen (DO), but not ammonia/ nitrite. While Candidatus Brocadiae diversity decreased with increasing DO, Candidatus Brocadiae 16S rRNA genes and hydrazine synthase (hzsB) genes and transcripts were detected across a wide range of bulk groundwater DO concentrations (0 to 10 mg/L). Anammox genes and transcripts correlated significantly with those involved in aerobic ammonia oxidation (amoA), potentially representing a major source of nitrite for anammox. Eight Candidatus Brocadiae genomes (63 to 95% complete), representing 2 uncharacterized families and 6 novel species, were reconstructed. Six genomes have genes characteristic of anammox, all for chemolithoautotrophy. Anammox and aerotolerance genes of up to four Candidatus Brocadiae genomes were transcriptionally active under oxic and dysoxic conditions, although activity was highest in dysoxic groundwater. The coexpression of nrfAH nitrite reductase genes by Candidatus Brocadiae suggests active regeneration of ammonia for anammox. Our findings indicate that anammox bacteria contribute to loss of fixed N across diverse anoxic-to-oxic aquifer conditions, which is likely supported by nitrite from aerobic ammonia oxidation. IMPORTANCE Anammox is increasingly shown to play a major role in the aquatic nitrogen cycle and can outcompete heterotrophic denitrification in environments low in organic carbon. Given that aquifers are characteristically oligotrophic, anammox may represent a major route for the removal of fixed nitrogen in these environments, including agricultural nitrogen, a common groundwater contaminant. Our research confirms that anammox bacteria and the anammox process are prevalent in aquifers and occur across diverse lithologies (e.g., sandy gravel, sand-silt, and volcanic) and groundwater physicochemistries (e.g., various oxygen, carbon, nitrate, and ammonium concentrations). Results reveal niche differentiation among anammox bacteria largely driven by groundwater oxygen contents and provide evidence that anammox is supported by proximity to oxic niches and handoffs from aerobic ammonia oxidizers. We further show that this process, while anaerobic, is active in groundwater characterized as oxic, likely due to the availability of anoxic niches.","2022",NA,NA,"WOS:000760768900001"

However, theoretical and empirical tests of this idea have yielded inconsistent findings. We manipulated intraspecific trait diversity in a ciliate competing with a nematode for bacterial prey in experimental microcosms. We found that intraspecific trait variation inverted the original competitive hierarchy to favour the consumer with variable traits, ultimately resulting in competitive exclusion. This competitive outcome was driven by foraging traits (size, speed and directionality) that increased the ciliate's fitness ratio and niche overlap with the nematode. The interplay between consumer trait variation and competition resulted in non-additive cascading effects-mediated through prey defence traits-on prey community assembly. Our results suggest that predicting consumer competitive population dynamics and the assembly of prey communities will require understanding the complexities of trait variation within consumer species.","2022","NOV 2021","10.1111/ele.13924","WOS:000721029600001"

Samples were stored at 200 and 150 MPa for up to 6 days. Optimal pressure for milk HS was found to be 150 MPa, since no clotting was detected for up to 6 days. 150 MPa-HS caused the irreversible inactivation of inoculated Escherichia coli (5.13 +/- 0.33 logCFU mL-1) and Staphylococcus aureus (5.66 +/- 0.93 logCFU mL-1) within 2 and 6 days, respectively. Inactivation of total and faecal coliforms (3.0 log reductions) below the detection limit was achieved after just 2 days, whereas lactic acid bacteria and coagulase-positive Staphylococci were inactivated after 6 days. Pressurized storage also caused an increase in proteose peptones and the release of submicelles from casein micelles. Micelles progressively aggregated with pressure-unfolded beta-Lactoglobulin. These phenomena led to milk presenting up to 4-fold better foaming capacity, probably due to beta-Lactoglobulin unfolding or higher proteose peptones content. This work demonstrated the capability of HS to guarantee milk preservation during storage, and brought attention on the opportunity to consider the technology for milk pasteurization and functionality improvement.","2022","MAR 2022","10.1016/j.foodres.2022.111090","WOS:000799050300001"

However, this meat is very perishable and easily subjected to the action of both spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms. For this reason, in combination with cold storage, effective preservation techniques are required. There is increasing interest in the application of natural antimicrobials, such as essential oils, extracts, spices, and by-products of the food industry. This review analyses the studies on natural antimicrobials in sheep meat and sheep meat products and gathers evidence about the encouraging results achieved on the reduction and/or elimination of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms. The use of these natural antimicrobial alternatives might open up important perspectives for industrial application, considering that this specific meat is often traded over long distances. In fact, on the basis of scientific literature, natural antimicrobials can be considered a sustainable and affordable alternative to extend the shelf life of sheep meat and guarantee its safety, although many factors need to be further investigated, such as the sensory impact, potential toxicity, and economic aspects. For all these issues, investigated in some of the studies reviewed here, it is fundamental to obtain the antimicrobial effect with the minimum amount of effective substance to avoid sensory modifications, toxic effects, and unbearable costs. This study sets foundations for the possible direction of future studies, which will contribute to identify effective solutions for industrial applications of natural antimicrobials in the sheep meat industry.","2022","JUL 2022","10.1111/1541-4337.13004","WOS:000829407000001"

Two models of microcapsules were produced from co-encapsulation of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) nanoemulsion or nanocomposite and synbiotic bacteria (maltodextrin with Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum) using the freeze-drying technique. These models of microcapsules were added to stirred yogurt, and then its storage effect on microbiology, chemically, and sensory properties were evaluated for 21 days. The average droplet size and zeta potential distribution of EVOO nanoemulsion and nanocomposite were investigated. Also, oxidative stability, microencapsulation efficiency, release profile, and antioxidant activity were studied. The results showed that the average particle size of EVOO nanoemulsion and nanocomposite ranged between 416 and 475 nm, while zeta potential was -39.6 and -33.6 mV, respectively. The induction period of EVOO extracted from nanoemulsion and nanocomposite microcapsules models was 11.30 and 8 h. The microencapsulation efficiency of probiotic and EVOO was determined at 88.84 and 65.61% for the nanoemulsion microcapsules model, while the nanocomposite microcapsules model showed 98.49 and 72%. The two models of microcapsules have boosted the viability of probiotic bacteria inside stirred yogurt than free cells. Also, the presence of microcapsules did not affect the viability of stirred yogurt starter cultures, and high values for the total solid and protein were detected. Therefore, the results recommended that stirred yogurt is a good delivery carrier for highly antioxidant and healthy microcapsules of synbiotic EVOO nanoemulsion and nanocomposite.","2022",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2022.893053","WOS:000806294300001"

Grape pomace extract was used as an antimicrobial agent and guar gum (GG) as a matrix. Plate count agar and pour plate technique were used for mesophilic bacterial counts. The microbial analysis demonstrated that the control sample had an initial microbial count of 3.3 +/- 0.17 cfu g(-1) which reached > 10(7) cfu g(-1) after 4 days of storage at 10 degrees C thus limiting its shelf-life. However, mesophilic counts of 0.5% pomace treated samples were 2.7 +/- 0.14 cfu g(-1) and it remained below < 10(6) cfu g(-1) even after storage of 6 days at 10 degrees C. Sensory attributes of treated samples were comparable to fresh arils throughout the storage period. During storage, all samples showed significant loss of moisture thus consequently increase in their firmness. After 6 days of storage 2.9 +/- 0.15 and 2.7 +/- 0.13% of moisture loss was observed for control and 0.5% treated samples, respectively. Headspace gaseous composition of arils packed tray remains constant till the end of storage which might be due to very high CO2 and O-2 permeability of GG based active film used in the present study. Antioxidant activity, ascorbic acid, anthocyanins, phenolics, and flavonoids content of arils juice remain unchanged during treatment and storage.

In Japan, a new type of mixed compost fertilizer called compost-compound fertilizer mixture (CCFM) has been registered. It exhibits several merits for organic farming; that is, it is odorless, easy to handle, and has a controllable nutrient content. CCFM consists of compost mixed with chemical fertilizer, such that nutrient content can be effectively adjusted. Although it has been pointed out that pellet composts generate more greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs), such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O), the mechanism involved is not clearly understood. To investigate the effect of CCFM on GHGEs, soil microbial properties and plant growth, incubation and pot experiments were conducted in a Hungarian Chernozem and a Japanese Andosol. Both soils were incubated with 1) CCFM prepared using pig manure mixed with chemical fertilizer, 2) chemical fertilizer only, or 3) no fertilizer. A pot experiment was conducted using Komatsuna (Brassica rapa). In the Chernozem, the maximum N2O production rate was observed after chemical fertilizer treatment. The emission factors of chemical fertilizer and CCFM were 0.25% and 0.19%, respectively. In contrast, N2O production was not detected in the Andosol. Meanwhile, CO2 production was higher (P < 0.05) in the Chernozem than in the Andosol; furthermore, it was higher under CCFM than under chemical fertilizer treatment, with 7.5% of amended carbon changing to CO2, thus suggesting that dominant carbon remained in the soil. Microbial biomass increased faster in the Andosol than in the Chernozem and the change was faster under the CCFM than under the chemical fertilizer or control treatments. In the pot experiment, CCFM tended to enhance plant growth in both soils. These experiments showed that CCFM has a soil-carbon storage effect with less resultant GHGEs, especially in Andosols, thereby leading to a more sustainable agriculture. Nonetheless, further studies are required for long-term experiments with other crops.","2022","OCT 2021","10.1080/00380768.2021.1987139","WOS:000710399700001"

However, it is quite challenging to maintain consistency in field sampling, especially for water sample collection and storage. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of how sample storage conditions impact microbial community analyses and the magnitude of the potential storage effects, freshwater samples were collected and stored in bottles with lid closed and without lid at room temperature for up to 6 days. We revealed the dynamics of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial communities under different storage conditions over time. The eukaryotic microbial communities changed at a faster rate than the prokaryotic microbial communities during storage. The alpha diversity of the eukaryotic microbial communities was not substantially influenced by container status or storage time for up to 12 h, but the beta diversity differed significantly between the control and all treatment samples. By contrast, no significant changes of either the alpha or beta diversity of the prokaryotic microbial communities were observed within 12 h of room-temperature storage, regardless of the container status. The potential interactions between microbial taxa were more complex when samples were stored in sealed bottles, and the deterministic processes played an increasingly important role in shaping the freshwater microbial communities with storage time. Our results suggest that water samples collected and stored without refrigeration for no more than 12 h may still be useful for downstream analyses of prokaryotic microbial communities. If the eukaryotic microbial communities are desired, storage of water samples should be limited to 3 h at room temperature.","2022",NA,"10.3390/microorganisms10061176","WOS:000818510300001"

The microorganisms (total bacterial count and fungi and yeast count) in the juice were identified after different sterilization techniques, while the quality parameter changes (degree of browning, color measurements, total phenolic content, reducing sugar, ascorbic acid, 5-hydroxymethyl furaldehyde (5-HMF), amino acid nitrogen, total soluble solids (TSS), pH value) were investigated. The results indicate that P and HHP treatment reduced non-enzymatic browning while substantially impacting the color measurements, TSS, and pH, while the sterilization effect was remarkable, with a rate exceeding 90%. Furthermore, the Prunus mume juices treated with P and HHP sterilization were used as the objects, and the CK group was used as the control group. They were placed at 4 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C, respectively, and stored in dark for 15 d. Sampling and determination were carried out on 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 d, respectively. M-&-Y (molds and yeasts) were not detected in the late storage period, and no obvious microbial growth was observed during storage, indicating that P and HHP treatments could ensure the microbial safety of Prunus mume juice. P- and HHP- treated Prunus mume juice has better quality and low temperature storage is beneficial for maintaining the quality of Prunus mume juice. Therefore, P treatment or HHP treatment combined with low temperature storage could achieve a more ideal storage effect. Overall, this study conclusively established that P and HHP methods were suitable for sterilizing Prunus mume juice. These techniques minimally affected overall product quality while better maintaining the quality parameters than the untreated juice samples and those exposed to O-3 and US treatment.","2022",NA,"10.3390/molecules27041197","WOS:000764288100001"

In this study, the method of Co-60 gamma irradiation was used to dynamically monitor the effects of fresh hazelnuts on storage quality, physiological indicators, and sterilization effect after being irradiated and refrigerated at 4 +/- 0.5 degrees C for 3 months. The results showed that irradiation at a dose of 0.25 to 1.0 kGy could preserve the current quality of the product, delay the browning of hazelnut shells, and reduce the activity of polyphenol oxidase. In addition, 0.5 kGy irradiation inhibited the respiration intensity and the accumulation of malondialdehyde in hazelnut fruits at the later stage of storage. Further research found that the content of microorganisms in hazelnut fruits decreased with the increase in irradiation dose. In addition, 0.5 kGy was the best irradiation dose to slow down the transpiration of hazelnut water and delay the reduction of fat, but the irradiation treatment of less than 1.0 kGy was effective for hazelnuts. Fruit peroxide value had no significant effect. At the same time, through the principal component analysis of hazelnut fruits stored for 90 days, the results also show that the Co-60 gamma irradiation with a dose of 0.5 kGy has the best storage effect and can effectively prolong the shelf life. The results of this study provide an effective theoretical basis and technical support for the preservation of fresh hazelnut fruits and the inhibition of the browning of hazelnut shells during storage. Novelty impact statement In this study, Co-60 gamma irradiation inhibited the polyphenol oxidase activity of polyphenol oxidase to a certain extent, thus delaying the browning of hazelnut shells.

We extended a one-compartment model of conjugation to a two-compartment model, to analyse how differences in plasmid dynamics in the gut lumen and at the gut wall affect the invasion of plasmids. We compared scenarios with one and two compartments, different migration rates between the lumen and wall compartments, and different population dynamics. We focused on the effect of attachment and detachment rates on plasmid dynamics, explicitly describing pair formation followed by plasmid transfer in the pairs. The parameter space allowing plasmid invasion in the one-compartment model is affected by plasmid costs and intrinsic conjugation rates of the transconjugant, but not by these characteristics of the donor. The parameter space allowing plasmid invasion in the two-compartment model is affected by attachment and detachment rates in the lumen and wall compartment, and by the bacterial density at the wall. The one- and two-compartment models predict the same parameter space for plasmid invasion if the conditions in both compartments are equal to the conditions in the one-compartment model. In contrast, the addition of the wall compartment widens the parameter space allowing invasion compared with the one-compartment model, if the density at the wall is higher than in the lumen, or if the attachment rate at the wall is high and the detachment rate at the wall is low. We also compared the pair-formation models with bulk-conjugation models that describe conjugation by instantaneous transfer of the plasmid at contact between cells, without explicitly describing pair formation. Our results show that pair-formation and bulk-conjugation models predict the same parameter space for plasmid invasion. From our simulations, we conclude that conditions at the gut wall should be taken into account to describe plasmid dynamics in the gut and that transconjugant characteristics rather than donor characteristics should be used to parameterize the models.

Fungal pathogen-exclusion treatment successfully decreased the severity of foliar fungal diseases, with no detectable effects on root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi or on soil chemical properties. Fungal pathogens were important factors shaping CNDD across 25 coexisting plant species. Exclusion of fungal pathogens significantly reduced plant species richness and Shannon's evenness. Treatments that excluded fungal pathogens also led to significant shifts in plant community composition toward more Poaceae and Cyperaceae.

Across 10 common alpine plant species, we found a total of 318 bacterial and 128 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) associated with seeds, with fungal richness affected by plant species identity more than sampling location. However, seed microbes had only marginally significant effects on plant germination success and timing. In contrast, soil microbes associated with two different plant species had significant effects on plant biomass, and their effect depended both on the plant species and the location the soils were sampled from. This led to significant changes in plant-soil feedback at different locations that varied in plant density and richness, such that plant-soil feedback favored plant species coexistence in some locations and opposed coexistence at other locations. Importantly, we found that coexistence-facilitating feedback was associated with low plant species richness, suggesting that soil microbes may promote the diversity of colonizing plants during the course of climate change and glacial recession.","2022","OCT 2022","10.1007/s00442-022-05271-z","WOS:000866310100001"

The strategy takes into account the public good stabilizing mechanisms known in social evolution theory by elaborating a systematic evaluation of the exploitability of target public goods under the most relevant experimental conditions, as well as a careful assessment of the most optimal approach to interfere with their action. Interference with public good cooperation provides a promising novel antimicrobial strategy since social evolution theory predicts that resistant mutants will be counter-selected if they share the public benefits of their resistance with sensitive cells in the population. Although this hypothesis is supported by a limited number of pioneering studies, an extensive body of more fundamental work on social evolution describes a multitude of mechanisms and conditions that can stabilize public behaviour, thus potentially allowing resistant mutants to thrive. In this paper we theorize on how these different mechanisms can influence the evolution of resistance against public good inhibitors. Based hereon, we propose an innovative 5-step screening strategy to identify novel evolution-proof public good inhibitors, which involves a systematic evaluation of the exploitability of public goods under the most relevant experimental conditions, as well as a careful assessment of the most optimal way to interfere with their action.

In addition, emulsions were prepared at varying conditions (pH 3-5) and formulations (1-30 wt% MCT oil, 0.1-2 wt% SBP), and their droplet size distributions were measured. The smallest oil droplets could be stabilized at pH 3. However, significantly more pectin was required at pH 3 compared to pH 4 or 5 to sufficiently stabilize the oil droplets. Both phenomena were attributed to the more compact conformation of SBP at pH < pK(a): On the one hand, pectins adsorbed faster and in greater quantity, forming a thicker interfacial layer. On the other hand, they covered less interfacial area per SBP molecule. Therefore, the SBP concentration must be chosen appropriately depending on the conformation.","2022",NA,"10.3390/foods11020214","WOS:000757972100001"

Despite best efforts, complex microbiomes appear to be susceptible to large stochastic fluctuations. Current capabilities to assemble and control stable complex microbiomes are limited. Here, we propose a looped mass transfer design that stabilizes microbiomes over long periods of time. Five local microbiomes were continuously grown in parallel for over 114 generations and connected by a loop to a regional pool. Mass transfer rates were altered and microbiome dynamics were monitored using quantitative high-throughput flow cytometry and taxonomic sequencing of whole communities and sorted subcommunities. Increased mass transfer rates reduced local and temporal variation in microbiome assembly, did not affect functions, and overcame stochasticity, with all microbiomes exhibiting high constancy and increasing resistance. Mass transfer synchronized the structures of the five local microbiomes and nestedness of certain cell types was eminent. Mass transfer increased cell number and thus decreased net growth rates mu'. Subsets of cells that did not show net growth mu'SCx were rescued by the regional pool R and thus remained part of the microbiome. The loop in mass transfer ensured the survival of cells that would otherwise go extinct, even if they did not grow in all local microbiomes or grew more slowly than the actual dilution rate D would allow. The rescue effect, known from metacommunity theory, was the main stabilizing mechanism leading to synchrony and survival of subcommunities, despite differences in cell physiological properties, including growth rates.","2022",NA,"10.1073/pnas.2117814119","WOS:000796327900002"

However, little is known about the mechanism of C stabilization in Mollisols, especially subjected to different management effects. To trace C stabilization between aggregates and SOM density fractions in Mollisols, soil samples were collected from different experimental plots: controlled irrigation + rice (Oryza sativa L.) straw removal (CI), flooded irrigation + rice straw removal (FI), controlled irrigation + rice straw return (CI-SR), and flooded irrigation + rice straw return (FI-SR). Each soil sample was separated into three aggregate size classes (> 250 pm, 53-250 pm, and < 53 pm), then each class individually subjected to density fractionation to obtain free and occluded light fractions (fLF and oLF), as well as dense and mineral-heavy fractions (DF and MF). The overall C content and 13C abundance of fractions were measured to interpret C transfer and accumulation among aggregate and density fractions. The highest increase in the soil organic C (9.27-24.88%) was observed in CI-SR compared with the other treatments. Irrigation and straw return primarily affected C accumulation within macroaggregates and the MF, which were the dominant forms in the aggregates and density fractions, respectively. An enrichment in delta C-13 was found from macroaggregates to silt + clay, and from light to heavy fractions, indicating that Mollisols macroaggregates and light fractions acted as the source or initial store of plant residues, and that the C in the silt + clay class and heaviest fraction contained more microbially-transformed C than did the macroaggregates and light fractions. A detailed scheme of C transfer within aggregates and SOM fractions based on the delta C-13 natural abundance revealed the following general sequence: free light -> occluded light -> dense -> mineral fractions, concurring with results reported at upland sites. There is a greater probability of C transfer between SOM density fractions under CI. This contrasted with the results that CI decreases the possibility of C exchange between aggregates than FI, which indicates differences in the C stabilization processes between no-flooded and flooded conditions of Mollisols. In addition, straw returning can reduce the possibility of C exchange both between and within aggregates, which plays a significant role in maintaining the stability of the Mollisols carbon cycle. The present study provides further detailed insights into the C stabilizing mechanisms in Mollisols which depend on management (straw, water status). This finding is conducive to the sustainable use and management of Mollisols toward maintaining or increasing C stock and in realizing the objective of C-neutral agriculture.","2022","APR 2022","10.1016/j.soilbio.2022.108684","WOS:000797329100004"

From the water sorption isotherm and glass transition temperature curve, the water activity where glass transition occurs at 25 degrees C (typical room temperature) was determined to be 0.28. These values for carnosine were higher than for sucrose, but lower than for trehalose. Effect of carnosine on the viability of freeze-dried LAB (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Lactobacillus paracasei) before and after storage at 37 degrees C for 4 weeks was compared with that of other antioxidants (cysteine, glutathione, and ascorbic acid). Carnosine and cysteine strongly ameliorated reductions in cell viability after the storage. Carnosine showed the highest number of viable cells for L. reuteri and L. paracasei. The stabilizing mechanism of carnosine is thought to be attributed to water substitution, glass transition, antioxidation, and optimum pH.","2022","SEP 2021","10.1007/s11483-021-09694-8","WOS:000701373300001"

Therefore, the C stabilization pathways in Ultisols may challenge the current common understanding, which is that the major pathway is the stabilization of microbial-derived C to minerals. In addition, organic amendments are expected to affect C stabilization pathways by promoting SOC decomposition and changing SOC composition. However, limited evidence has been found for Ultisols, and the underlying mechanism remains under discussion. C stabilization processes lead to C-13 fractionation and changes in SOC composition among aggregate fractions. Therefore, C-13 natural abundance and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry approaches were applied to investigate C-13 fractionation and SOC composition, especially the relative content of recalcitrant C, such as lignin and lipids, and the humification degree represented by the O-alkyl/alkyl ratio, between aggregate size classes. Five fertilization regimes from an 8-year field experiment were selected: no fertilization (CK), inorganic fertilizer (NPK), NPK + straw (NS), NPK + straw and manure (NSM), and NPK + biochar (NC). The bulk soil was separated into three aggregate fractions: > 2000 mu m, 250-2000 mu m, and < 250 mu m. In all treatments, C-13 presented greater depletion in microaggregates (< 250 mu m) than macroaggregates (> 2000 mu m and 250-2000 mu m). Regarding the changes in SOC composition, in non-organic-amended treatments (CK and NPK) and NC, recalcitrant C fractions, such as lignin and lipids, were more abundant in < 250 mu m aggregates. With the fresh organic material (OM) application (NS and NSM), the lowest O-alkyl/alkyl ratio was found in the > 2000 mu m aggregates, suggesting a high humification degree. Summarizing the delta C-13 and SOC composition results, in the non-organic-amended treatments and NC, the depletion of delta C-13 in microaggregates coincided with the enrichment of recalcitrant C, which suggests that the depletion of delta C-13 was primarily controlled by the preferential substrate utilization mechanism. Thus, labile C with heavier delta C-13 is preferentially decomposed while partially oxidized recalcitrant C with lighter delta C-13 was adsorbed to the mineral surface and protected in microaggregates. Because the delta C-13 value decreases with the aggregate size, C flow (modeled in a scheme) primarily occurred from macroaggregates to microaggregates. With fresh OM input (NS and NSM), the C stabilization pathway was primarily governed by the kinetic fractionation mechanism; that is, heavier delta C-13 remained after microbial utilization, which was reflected by the association of heavier delta C-13 and a lower O-alkyl/alkyl ratio. With macroaggregates exhibiting C-13 enrichment, the C flow was primarily from microaggregates to macroaggregates. These results highlight the importance of the accumulation and protection of plant-derived recalcitrant C in microaggregates in the C stabilization pathway of Ultisols and emphasize that the C stabilizing mechanisms largely depend on organic amendments.","2022","AUG 2022","10.1016/j.geoderma.2022.116088","WOS:000861246400009"

However, it remains largely unknown how fertilizer regimes and soil particle sizes drive bacterial interactions. To evaluate bacterial interaction patterns in soil aggregates under long-term fertilizer treatments, we sampled nine bacterial co-occurrence communities and compared the difference between interspecies resource consumption patterns and network structure. Despite the differences between fertilizer treatments, the negative correlation ratios of interaction networks in soil aggregates were macroaggregates > microaggregates > silt + clays. Likewise, NPK-supplement (chemical fertilizer) had also decreased the number of positive correlations of the interaction network than M-supplement (organic fertilizer), regardless of the size of soil aggregates. Linear model analysis revealed that interspecies trophic patterns, including niche overlap and nestedness, drove bacterial competition in the interaction networks. Most importantly, interspecies niche overlap may be the intrinsic factor in the effects of fertilizer treatments and soil aggregates on bacterial interactions. This study enhances our understanding of the potential for changes in species trophic patterns and might guide the promotion of land management. IMPORTANCE Despite that the influence of soil structure and fertilizer treatments on the bacterial community has been widely studied, how they drive interspecies interactions has not been largely explored. Connectance and nestedness were significantly correlated with bacterial interactions, but no differences were found in different soil aggregates and fertilizer treatments. However, interspecies niche overlap could respond to soil aggregates and fertilizer treatments and ultimately drive the bacterial interactions. This study enhances our understanding of the mechanism of microbial interactions and highlights the importance of trophic patterns in the bacterial community. Our findings extend knowledge for nutrient availability on interspecific interactions.","2022",NA,NA,"WOS:000835142100220"

To understand the seasonal variation in the phytoplankton community in Lake Wuchang, Anhui Province, water samples were collected in three different hydrological periods (dry season, normal season, and wet season) from December 2019 to August 2020. The dominance value (Y), niche width (B-i), niche overlap (O-ij), variance ratio method (VR), chi-squared test (chi(2)), and association coefficients were used to analyze the niche and interspecific association with respect to the dominant phytoplankton species in different hydrological periods, while the redundancy analysis method (RDA) was used to distinguish the key driving environmental factors for the dominant phytoplankton species. The results showed that 308 species belonging to 8 phyla were identified, of which 13 species from 4 phyla were the dominant species. From the dry season to wet season, the dominant species changed from Bacillariophyta to Cyanophyta, while Synedra acus was the dominant species throughout the hydrological periods. The niche width of the dominant species varied from 1.77 to 6.65, and the niche width of Dinobryon was the lowest, while that of Synedra acus was the highest. The niche overlap showed temporal and spatial differences, of which 30 dominant species pairs were greater than 0.600, indicating that they occupied the environmental resources in a highly similar way. The interspecific association results showed that there was a significant positive correlation between the dominant species, especially in normal and wet seasons. Only 10 of the 48 dominant species pairs had significant associations based on the chi(2) test, and two pairs had negative associations in the wet season, which might be related to the hydrological condition in the wet season. According to redundancy analysis, NO3 (-)-N, NH4 (+)-N, PO4 (3-)-P, water depth (WD), and water temperature (WT) were the key environmental factors affecting the phytoplankton community variation in Lake Wuchang.

Following Bighead Carp stocking, proportional contributions of phytoplankton to fishes significantly decreased for the other fishes (P < 0.05), and the contributions of particulate organic matter to the fishes significantly increased (P < 0.05) except for Common Bream. In addition, the total isotopic niche width of fishes increased from 12.01 to 13.06 and isotopic niche overlap between fishes increased from 22.75% to 42.50% following stocking; this change was particularly apparent in the large changes in the isotopic niche overlap between Common Bream and Bighead Carp (from 67 to 95%) and between Common Bream and Pond Smelt (from 65 to 100%), followed by that between Bighead Carp and Pond Smelt (from 0 to 90%). Furthermore, the obvious increase in isotopic niche overlap may be the reason for the reduced growth observed in Bighead Carp and in Pond Smelt. These findings highlighted that Bighead Carp stocking changed the availability of basal food sources for other sympatric fishes and increased the potential for interspecific competition among fishes. Overall, our study suggested the introduced Bighead Carp stocking had undesirable effects on fish community in Ulungur Lake.","2022","JAN 2022","10.1007/s10530-021-02715-0","WOS:000745753300001"

Network analyses offer a powerful means for characterizing patterns of interaction among microbial members of the phytobiome that may be crucial to mediating its assembly and function. We sampled twelve endophytic communities, comparing patterns of niche overlap between coexisting bacteria and fungi to evaluate the effect of nutrient supplementation on local and global competitive network structure. We found that, despite differences in the degree distribution, there were few significant differences in the global network structure of niche-overlap networks following persistent nutrient amendment. Likewise, we found idiosyncratic and weak evidence for higher-order interactions regardless of nutrient treatment.

Microbes could quickly capture the nutrition to outcompete their competitors or efficiently cross-feed to cooperate with other bacterial species. However, how interspecies trophic patterns shape the bacterial interactions in the co-occurrence network remains unclear. This study investigates the role of trophic patterns, containing niche overlap and nestedness, on the bacterial relationships in the co-occurrence network structure. Materials and methods We assessed the correlation between bacterial interactions and trophic patterns according to high-throughput techniques and culturomics. A co-occurrence network was constructed to obtain the relationship of OTUs. The substrate consumption patterns of culturable bacteria were used to calculate the interspecies trophic patterns. Results and discussion The co-occurrence network was constructed by the thirty-three culturable bacteria that matched 33 OTUs with 112 links in total. The negative correlation pairs possessed a higher niche overlap than the positive correlations pairs. However, negative and positive correlation pairs displayed no significant differences in the niche nestedness. Interestingly, we found substrate types could also influence microbial interactions. Elucidating the association between the trophic patterns and interspecies interaction is crucial for comprehending the resource's role and contribution to the microbial community. Conclusion Together, these findings indicate that interspecies trophic patterns, such as niche overlap, could be a predictor to understand the bacterial relationships in the co-occurrence network.","2022","FEB 2022","10.1007/s11368-022-03165-4","WOS:000754940300002"

A phenotypic shift towards the utilization of alternative carbon sources was observed during coexistence, thereby minimizing niche overlap. Differences between species promote stable coexistence in a resource-limited environment. These differences can result from interspecies competition leading to character shifts, a process referred to as character displacement. While character displacement is often interpreted as a consequence of genetically fixed trait differences between species, it can also be mediated by phenotypic plasticity in response to the presence of another species. Here, we test whether phenotypic plasticity leads to a shift in proteome allocation during co-occurrence of two bacterial species from the abundant, leaf-colonizing families Sphingomonadaceae and Rhizobiaceae in their natural habitat. Upon mono-colonizing of the phyllosphere, both species exhibit specific and shared protein functions indicating a niche overlap. During co-colonization, quantitative differences in the protein repertoire of both bacterial populations occur as a result of bacterial coexistence in planta. Specifically, the Sphingomonas strain produces enzymes for the metabolization of xylan, while the Rhizobium strain reprograms its metabolism to beta-oxidation of fatty acids fueled via the glyoxylate cycle and adapts its biotin acquisition. We demonstrate the conditional relevance of cross-species facilitation by mutagenesis leading to loss of fitness in competition in planta. Our results show that dynamic character displacement and niche facilitation mediated by phenotypic plasticity can contribute to species coexistence.","2022",NA,"10.1038/s41467-022-30469-3","WOS:000799632400024"

Understanding how these biofilm metabolic interactions are constrained in space and time remains challenging because fully predictive models designed for this purpose are currently limited. Toward filling this gap, here we developed community metabolic network models for two autotroph-heterotrophbiofilm consortia (termed UCC-A and UCC-O), which share a suite of common heterotrophic members but have a single distinct photoautotrophic cyanobacterium (Phormidesmis priestleyi str. ANA and Phormidium sp. OSCR) that provides organic carbon and nitrogen sources to support the growth of heterotrophic partners. After determining model parameters by data fitting using the spatiotemporal distributions of microbial abundances, we comparatively analyzed the resulting biofilm models to examine any fundamental differences in microbial interactions between the two consortia under the variation of key environmental variables: CO2 and photon levels. The UCC-A model predicted generally expected responses, i.e., the autotroph population increased in response to elevated levels of CO2 and photon, followed by increase in the heterotroph population. In contrast, the UCC-O model showed somewhat complicated dynamics, e.g., higher photon incidence rates resulted in the increase in autotroph population but decrease in heterotroph population due to the lowered provision of glucose from the autotroph. A further analysis showed that species coexistence was governed by the photon incidences rather than the carbon availability for UCC-O, which was the opposite for UCC-A.

Phylogenetically close species may present niche conservatism, retaining their ancestral ecological characteristics. Alternatively, in a situation of limited resources, species can differentiate themselves through changes in their ecological and morphological characteristics to reduce niche overlap, thus facilitating coexistence. In this study, we investigated the ecological niche of two phylogenetically closely related cryptobenthic reef fish species that co-occur in the southern Brazilian coast, Parablennius pilicornis and P. marmoreus. We examined possible overlap in three niche dimensions (thermal, spatial and trophic) to verify if species hold phylogenetic niche conservatism or are partitioning some niche dimension. For this, we studied their densities, microhabitat affinities and diets among four rocky reefs of southern Brazil. The two species presented differences in thermal distribution, and their abundance differed according to depth strata, but no differences were found for microhabitat preferences. They also presented a similar omnivorous diet, with crustaceans and algae as main prey types. The Pianka's niche overlap values did not differ from the values expected in the null model for thermal and depth, and it was higher than expected by chance for microhabitat and diet. Considering all the niche dimensions analysed together, the total niche overlap was greater than expected at random. These results suggest that the two species are successfully coexisting despite considerable niche overlap. Thus, their coexistence may not depend on the evolution of divergent patterns of resource use, but on the evolutionary history of the species.","2022",NA,"10.1007/s00227-021-04009-4","WOS:000743947700006"

This study aimed to evaluate how trophic interactions between congeneric fish species (Serrapinnus calliurus, S. heterodon and S. notomelas) are affected by habitat complexity provided by macrophytes. The following predictions were tested: (1) the composition of the diets of congeneric fish species differs between high- and low-complexity habitats and between habitats of the same category; (2) species show higher trophic niche breadth in sites with greater habitat complexity; and (3) trophic niche overlap between congeneric species pairs is low in macrophyte stands because of greater food availability. Sampling was conducted between November 2011 and July 2012 in five floodplain lakes of the Baia River, a tributary of the upper Parana River. The degree of habitat complexity was categorised as high (with macrophytes) or low (without macrophytes). The stomach contents of the three species sampled from sites of high- or low-complexity habitat were analysed. Diet variation depended on habitat complexity. The median trophic niche breadth of the three congeneric species was low, but their diets showed higher variability in sites of high-complexity habitat. Significant differences in trophic niche overlap were observed in two species pairs when comparing sites of high- and low-complexity habitat. Habitat complexity directly affected trophic interactions between the fish species, which may favour their coexistence through trophic niche segregation.

Here, using paired subsoil samples from half month-camping and non-camping, we showed for the first time that camping significantly changed the relative abundance of 21 bacterial phylotypes and five fungal phylotypes. Specifically, we observed significant increases in the relative abundance of putative chitinase and terpenes vanillin-decomposition genes, nitrite reduction function (nirB, nasA), decreases in the relative abundance of putative carbon fixation genes (ackA, PGK, and Pak), starch-decomposition gene (dexB), gene coding nitrogenase (anfG), and tetracycline resistance gene (tetB) for bacterial communities, and significant decreases in the relative abundance of animal endosymbiont and increases in the relative abundance of litter saprotroph and endophyte for fungal communities. However, camping did not significantly impact the taxonomic and functional diversity. The niche restriction was the main driving force of bacterial and fungal community assembly. Compared to no camping, camping increased the stability of bacterial networks but decreased the stability of fungal networks. Camping exerted a positive effect on the network by compressing the niche width and reduced the change in the network by reducing the niche overlap. Our results suggest that camping restructures the soil microbial composition, function, and network, and provides a novel insight into the effect of animal camping on soil microbial communities in grassland.","2022",NA,"10.7717/peerj.14314","WOS:000919728400002"

Fungal sporophores that are sensitive to seasonality change are ideal candidates for studying the role of temporal differentiation hypothesis in species' coexistence. In this study, a field survey of fungal sporocarps was conducted from May to October, and the entity and abundance of different species of fungal sporocarps in a 5-hectare forest dynamic plot in a temperate, deciduous broad-leaved forest were recorded.

The torus-translation test showed that 56 species exhibited ecological habitat preferences for different months (47/100, 47%). The distribution of soil fungal sporocarps (35/75, 46.67%) based on months showed higher specialization compared with that of rotten-wood fungal sporocarps (9/22, 40.90%).

Among the many factors implicated in the ongoing loss of amphibian biodiversity are climate change and the disease chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). These threats are of particular concern in Australia, where Bd has been implicated in the declines of at least 43 frog species, and climate change is emerging as an additional threat. We explore how climate change is likely to affect the distributions of Australian frog species and Bd to the year 2100, and how the spatial and climatic niche overlap between chytridiomycosis-declined frogs and Bd could shift. Location Australia. Methods We used species distribution modelling to infer the current and future distribution of 141 Australian frog species and Bd, under two emissions scenarios. We used various metrics of niche similarity to quantify predicted alterations to spatial interactions between Bd and frog species. Results Climate change is likely to have a variable impact on frog distributions in Australia, with some 23 and 47 species, primarily in southern Australia, predicted to lose at least 30% of their current distributions under low and high emissions scenarios, respectively. In contrast, 69 and 68 species, respectively, have potential to increase their distributions, primarily in northern Australia. While the distribution of Bd is predicted to decrease, the proportional spatial and niche overlap between Bd and susceptible frog species is predicted to remain little changed, and in some cases, to increase. Main conclusions Although effects will be variable across the continent, climate change is likely to be a threatening factor to many Australian frog species. Additionally, chytridiomycosis is likely to remain a significant threat to many frog species, as any reductions to the pathogen's distribution largely coincide with geographic range contractions of chytridiomycosis-susceptible species.","2022","MAY 2022","10.1111/ddi.13533","WOS:000789791500001"

However, knowledge regarding the influence of root exudates on soil communities, particularly concerning their assembly processes and species coexistence patterns, remains limited. In this study, we performed a 20-month pot experiment using a nitrogen (N) addition gradient (0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, and 15 g N m(-2) yr(-1)), amplicon sequencing, and metabolomics to investigate the effect of short-term N addition on the assembly process and species coexistence of fungal communities, as well as their association with root exudates in the rhizosphere and bulk soils around Bothriochloa ischaemum. The results demonstrated that short-term N addition led to distinct differences in the diversity, composition, assembly process, and co-occurrence networks of fungal communities in the rhizosphere and bulk soils. The diversity of fungal communities in the rhizosphere soil increased with the rate of N input and peaked at N10 treatment; this could be correlated with the increased abundance in long-chain organic acids (LCOAs). However, above the threshold N rate of 10 g N m(-2) yr(-1), diversity decreased probably because of the high N-induced inhibitory effect on root exudates (i.e., LCOAs). N addition increased the relative abundance of Sordariomycetes in the rhizosphere and decreased the relative abundance of Mortierellomycetes in the bulk soil, while enhancing the abundance of pathotrophs in both bulk and rhizosphere soils. The rhizosphere fungal community was dominated by a stochastic process at a low N input (N0 and N2.5) and by deterministic processes at a high N input (N10 and N15), which is opposite to the trends in the bulk soil. These fungal assembly processes determine the coexistence of fungal species; deterministic processes lead to less interconnected networks in rhizosphere soils that harbor a more complex network than the bulk soil. Associations between the assembly process and species coexistence in the rhizosphere of B. ischaemum were closely related to the changes in root exudates, such as amino acids, short-chain organic acids, and phenols, which were stimulated by N addition. Collectively, our study emphasizes the key roles of root exudates in the establishment of fungal communities in the plant soil system and furthers our understanding of plant-microbe interactions.

However, knowledge of bacteria as bio-indicators' synergistic response to disturbance patterns and nutrient addition is still poor. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a mesocosm experiment over 21 days, and collected 90 water samples from tanks under six different patterns of disturbance and nutrient addition; we explored the bacterial communities using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We found significantly increased bacterial diversity in continuously disturbed conditions and in intermittently disturbed conditions, and significantly decreased bacterial diversity under the synergistic effect of disturbances and nutrients. Bacterial community composition (BCC) under conditions of disturbance and nutrient addition exhibited different variations. However, there were no significant differences in BCC between continuously and intermittently disturbed mesocosms. Co-occurrence networks analysis showed that the proportion of positive correlations among edges in nutrient addition conditions were significantly higher than that in disturbed condition, indicating that nutrient input may increase the proportion of niche overlap, and enhance positive interactions among bacteria. Meanwhile, the co-occurrence patterns between algal and bacterial communities suggested shared environmental preferences or potential interactions among these two groups.

Currently, abundant bacterial species are of primary concern, while the role of more diverse and copious rare species remains largely unknown. Using a dilution-to-extinction approach, rare bacterial species from reservoir water were co-cultured with the bloom-forming cyanobacterium Raphidiopsis raciborskii in the lab to explore their interactions by using Phyto-PAM and 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing. We found that a <= 1000-fold bacterial dilution led to bacteria control of the growth and photosynthesis of R. raciborskii. Moreover, the bacterial community compositions in the low-dilution groups were clearly diverged from the highdilution groups. Importantly, rare species changed dramatically in the low-dilution groups, resulting in lower phylogenetic diversity and narrower niche width. The network complexity and compositional stability of bacterial communities decreased in the low-dilution groups. Collectively, our results suggest that rare bacterial species inhibit R. raciborskii growth and photosynthesis through microbial interactions mediated by species coexistence and interaction mechanisms.

This might drive resource competition dynamics that cumulatively impact tree species coexistence, but few manipulative experiments have directly tested this. Combining surveys and experiments in a modern coexistence theory framework, we tested how variation in mycorrhizal strategies and nutrient conditions affects plant competitive outcomes. We focused on two genera of co-occurring tree species with different mycorrhizal states: Acer (arbuscular mycorrhizal, AM) and Populus (dual mycorrhizal, but often considered predominantly ectomycorrhizal, EM). The EM and AM fungal responsiveness in Populus species varied with latitude and nitrogen (N) limitation. Host-specific soil microbiome conditioning and inorganic N fertilization combined to qualitatively affect coexistence outcomes. Lower N conditions favoured Populus over Acer trees, and N fertilization reversed this outcome for southern species, aligning with regional-scale forest mycorrhizal transitions. Results from the coexistence experiment also predict competitive exclusion between the tree species pairs, which could arise, in part, from their mycorrhizal differences and is consistent with alternative stable states in dominant forest mycorrhizal strategies. Such bistability appears in natural systems as a bimodal distribution of Populus vs. Acer tree species dominance using long-term forest inventory data. Synthesis: The magnitude and outcome of microbially mediated competition between Populus and Acer depends on soil nutrient availability, which likely relates to their mycorrhizal differentiation. These findings support the importance of mycorrhizal symbioses for contributing to large-scale biogeographical patterns of tree species trophic niche separation across soil resource gradients and bistability in forest mycorrhizal structure.","2022","DEC 2022","10.1111/1365-2745.14040","WOS:000892667000001"

We assessed how fish consume particular foods, and how their foraging efficiency, trophic niche breadth, and niche overlap respond to gradients of macrophyte density and diversity. We sampled fish and macrophytes in 30 stands distributed over a 13.7 km stretch of the littoral zone of a river in Brazil. By generating generalized linear models, we showed that increasing macrophyte density (from 366 to 7066 g DW m(-3)) favored herbivory and fish foraging efficiency. Beta regressions showed that fish reduced their trophic niche breadth along the gradient of macrophyte density, while niche overlap increased until a certain extent of plant density when species started to segregate the niche more strongly. However, niche breadth responses varied according to the trophic guild considered, with omnivorous and herbivorous fish generally showing opposite responses. Macrophyte diversity was important for the preferred food items of the fish, with stomach contents shifting from higher plants, algae, and detritus to insects with increasing macrophyte diversity. Therefore, in addition to the presumable effects of macrophyte density on resource availability and prey encounter rates, our findings highlight the importance of maintaining diverse macrophyte stands for the conservation of fish diversity.","2022",NA,"10.3390/w14213543","WOS:000883986800001"
"Weimer, PJ","Degradation of Cellulose and Hemicellulose by Ruminal Microorganisms","MICROORGANISMS","As major structural components of plant cell walls, cellulose and hemicellulose are degraded and fermented by anaerobic microbes in the rumen to produce volatile fatty acids, the main nutrient source for the host. Cellulose degradation is carried out primarily by specialist bacteria, with additional contributions from protists and fungi, via a variety of mechanisms. Hemicelluloses are hydrolyzed by cellulolytic bacteria and by generalist, non-cellulolytic microbes, largely via extracellular enzymes. Cellulose hydrolysis follows first-order kinetics and its rate is limited by available substrate surface area. Nevertheless, its rate is at least an order of magnitude more rapid than in anaerobic digesters, due to near-obligatory adherence of microbial cells to the cellulose surface, and a lack of downstream inhibitory effects; in the host animal, fiber degradation rate is also enhanced by the unique process of rumination. Cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic microbes exhibit intense competition and amensalism, but they also display mutualistic interactions with microbes at other trophic levels. Collectively, the fiber-degrading community of the rumen displays functional redundancy, partial niche overlap, and convergence of catabolic pathways that all contribute to stability of the ruminal fermentation. The superior hydrolytic and fermentative capabilities of ruminal fiber degraders make them promising candidates for several fermentation technologies.","2022",NA,"10.3390/microorganisms10122345","WOS:000902928900001"

Climate change can alter species coexistence through changes in biotic interactions. By describing reciprocal interactions between plants and soil microbes, plant-soil feedback (PSF) has emerged as a powerful framework for predicting plant species coexistence and community dynamics, but little is known about how PSF will respond to changing climate conditions. Hence, the context dependency of PSF has recently gained attention. Water availability is a major driver of all biotic interactions, and it is expected that precipitation patterns will change with ongoing climate change. We tested how soil water content affects PSF by conducting a full factorial pairwise PSF experiment using eight plant species common to southeastern United States coastal prairies under three watering treatments. We found coexistence-stabilizing negative PSF at drier-than-average conditions shifted to coexistence-destabilizing positive PSF under wetter-than-average conditions. A simulation model parameterized with the experimental results supports the prediction that more positive PSF accelerates the erosion of diversity within communities while decreasing the predictability in plant community composition. Our results underline the importance of considering environmental context dependency of PSF in light of a rapidly changing climate.","2022","MAR 2022","10.1038/s41559-022-01700-7","WOS:000773832500005"
"Holík, J; Janík, D","Seed and seedling predation by vertebrates mediates the effects of adult trees in two temperate tree species","OECOLOGIA","Specialised natural enemies can locally suppress seeds and seedlings near conspecific adults more than far from them. Whilst this is thought to facilitate species coexistence, the relative contribution of multiple enemies to whether heterospecific seeds and seedlings rather than conspecifics perform better beneath a particular adult species remains less clear, especially in regions with spatially extensive monodominant stands. We designed a field exclusion experiment to separate the effects of fungi, insects and vertebrates on the seedling establishment and early survival of two temperate tree species, Fagus sylvatica and Picea abies, in the adult tree monocultures of these species. Our experiment demonstrates the key role of vertebrates in mediating the effects of adult trees on seeds and seedlings. Due to vertebrates and partly insects, Fagus sylvatica seedlings survived worse beneath conspecific than heterospecific adults and were also outperformed by Picea abies seedlings beneath their own adults. Picea abies seedling establishment was higher beneath conspecific than heterospecific adults, but Fagus sylvatica seedlings outperformed them beneath their own adults. The impact of enemies on Picea abies establishment beneath conspecific adults was less clear. Fungi did not influence seedling establishment and survival. Our findings highlight the need to compare enemy impacts on each seedling species beneath conspecific and heterospecific adults with their impacts on conspecific and heterospecific seedlings beneath a particular adult species. Such evaluations can shed more light on the role of enemies in tree communities by identifying the plant-enemy interactions that facilitate species coexistence and those that promote species monodominance.","2022","JUN 2022","10.1007/s00442-022-05203-x","WOS:000805888400004"

One aggregation mechanism, called depletion aggregation, is driven by physical forces between bacteria and high concentrations of polymers in the environment rather than bacterial activity per se. As such, bacteria aggregated by the depletion mechanism will disperse when polymer concentrations fall unless other adhesion mechanisms supervene. Here we investigated whether the depletion mechanism can actuate the aggregating effects of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exopolysaccharides for suspended (i.e. not surface attached) bacteria, and how depletion affects bacterial inter-species interactions. We found that cells overexpressing the exopolysaccharides Pel and Psl remained aggregated after short periods of depletion aggregation whereas wild-type and mucoid P. aeruginosa did not. In co-culture, depletion aggregation had contrasting effects on P. aeruginosa's interactions with coccus- and rod-shaped bacteria. Depletion caused S. aureus (cocci) and P. aeruginosa (rods) to segregate from each other and S. aureus to resist secreted P. aeruginosa antimicrobial factors resulting in species co-existence. In contrast, depletion aggregation caused P. aeruginosa and Burkholderia sp. (both rods) to intermix, enhancing type VI secretion inhibition of Burkholderia by P. aeruginosa, leading to P. aeruginosa dominance. These results show that in addition to being a primary cause of aggregation in polymer-rich suspensions, physical forces inherent to the depletion mechanism can promote aggregation by some self-produced exopolysaccharides and determine species distribution and composition of bacterial communities.","2022",NA,"10.3389/fcimb.2022.869736","WOS:000818520300001"

Soil nutrient content and soil bacterial richness were highest in the early-mid stages of succession, followed by mid and early stages of succession. Organic matter (OM), total nitrogen (TN), alkali nitrogen (AN), and available phosphorus (AP) had a stronger positive impact on soil bacterial communities. Co-occurrence network analysis showed that with the advancement of rainforests succession, the negative correlation between soil bacterial species decreased, and the community stability increased.

This allows them to cope with abundant but highly variable prey communities. The assessment of trophic relationships in shallow soft-bottom habitats is, however, challenging and often complicated by the bias and low resolution of the analytical tools available to study diet in relatively small invertebrates. This study investigates niche overlap between two dominant epibenthic predators in European estuarine soft-bottom environments, the brown shrimp (Crangon crangon L.) and the European green crab (Carcinus maenas L.), by means of trophic DNA-metabarcoding with universal primers for cytochrome c oxidase I (COI). Results show differences in diet composition between the two predators, despite the fact that both species are opportunistic generalists with a high overlap in prey items (218 overlapping Molecular Taxonomic Units). The European green crab showed a richer, more even, and more geographically consistent diet than the brown shrimp, with fairly balanced consumption of algal, arthropod, annelid and mollusc food items. The brown shrimp instead preferred arthropods and annelids, and showed more spatial variation in diet. The observed niche separation could be linked to behavioural variation between the two predators, with European green crab showing more active movements over shallow soft-bottom environments compared to the brown shrimp, which regularly stays buried in the sediment, ambushing its prey. An accurate understanding of the trophic ecology of these estuarine crustaceans is important to capitalise on their role as sentinel organisms since their diet reflects local diversity and can result in toxin bioaccumulation. This study provides new insights in the predator-prey relationships and food web dynamics in European estuaries and highlights the importance of trophic DNAmetabarcoding to study marine food webs.","2022","APR 2022","10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.108839","WOS:000792783400003"

However, there is still little information available on the trophic ecology for many benthic species to help us better understand trophic interactions and individual trophic roles. Here, we used stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15) in conjunction with the Bayesian ellipses approach to explore spatial trends in isotopic niche width and overlap of 3 syntopic arctic brittle stars (Echinodermata: Ophiuroidea; Ophiacantha bidentata, Ophiocten sericeum, and Ophiopleura borealis) in Baffin Bay (BB), the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA), and the North Water Polynya (NOW). These 3 coexisting ophiuroids displayed great interspecific plasticity in foraging behaviors and showed a high degree of inter-individual dietary flexibility. However, differences in surface carbon composition drove the variability of resource utilization at the individual level across stations, which in turn affected trophic interactions, niche overlaps, and isotopic niche breadth of ophiuroids. Greater niche overlap was found in the highly productive region of the NOW, where consumers exhibited similar food selectivity, whereas an increase in niche segregation occurred in regions with greater sea-ice concentration. These results suggest that isotopic niche size reflects individual responses to fluctuations in food availability and possibly past competition, both induced by local oceanographic features. Our study indicates that niche parameters of ophiuroids can respond quickly to ecological and environmental gradients, which suggests an important adaptability of these species facing multiple stressors.","2022",NA,"10.3354/meps13965","WOS:000752973500006"

Methanoculleus accounted for numerous archaeal communities inhabiting the polymer-flooded blocks but were hardly detected in the ASP-flooded blocks; the trends for Methanolinea were the opposite.

We applied network analysis to the co-occurrence pattern of archaeal communities in oil reservoirs. The archaeal communities in oil reservoirs were non-random, and that the community structure was more stable in the polymer- than in the ASP-flooded production wells.

Compared to oligotrophic systems, however, relatively little is known about the fate of primary production in these systems. In order to investigate the role of microzooplankton in grazing primary production in the Canary Current EBUE, grazing experiments were conducted as part of the Meteor M129 expedition. Water for experiments was taken from depths with the highest chlorophyll a concentrations and prescreened to remove mesozooplankton. Microzooplankton could consume between 60% and 95% of primary production, as measured by chlorophyll growth rates. When individual prey groups were examined, however, clear grazing effects were more mixed, with strong effects on nanoautotrophs and heterotrophic bacteria, varied effects on Synechococcus, and few statistically significant grazing effects on Prochlorococcus, pico-eukaryotes or heterotrophic nanoflagellates. The microplankton grazer community was diverse, with 22-33 ciliate and 10-26 dinoflagellate morphotypes. The large size range of the microplankton grazers and their high diversity resulted in a broad collective food niche and considerable niche overlap. This suggests that with sufficient diversity in the grazer community, changes in that community over the course of experiments may have minimal functional effect.","2022","APR 2022","10.1093/plankt/fbac015","WOS:000785561400001"

This study assessed the trophic niche utilized by an invasive population of the Australian redclaw crayfish, Cherax quadricarinatus, in the Inkomati River Basin, South Africa. It evaluated the hypothesis that the euryphagous feeding strategy of redclaw crayfish may allow it to shift its niche width and niche position by altering its feeding strategy in response to fluctuations in resource availability. Gut content and stable isotope analyses were used to determine trophic niche and trophic interactions. Redclaw crayfish were shown to be omnivores and their diet consisted mainly of algae, plant material and invertebrates. Small-sized individuals had a constricted niche width and fed primarily on invertebrates, whereas larger individuals expanded their niche width to include larger proportions of plant material. Crayfish caught from lotic environments had a higher proportion of invertebrates in their diet than crayfish from lentic environments, and the species exploited a wider niche in summer than in winter. These differences are likely related to differences in productivity amongst habitats and fluctuations in resource availability. There was significant niche overlap (>60%) between redclaw crayfish and Sidney's river crab (Potamonautes sidneyi), but not with other native invertebrates. Both species are omnivores and have similar functional roles, possibly making redclaw crayfish functionally redundant in this ecosystem. Even though both species mainly feed on resources (plant material and invertebrates) that are not normally limiting, the redclaw crayfish invasion might be an accelerator of ecosystem processes such as shredding and decomposition rates of plant material. There is, therefore, a need for further studies to examine potentially altered ecosystem functions caused by redclaw crayfish invasion in the Inkomati River system.","2022","AUG 2022","10.1111/aec.13230","WOS:000842237100001"

However, outbreaks of AI have been reported in the summer, including the breeding season of waterfowl. Additionally, the spatial distribution of waterfowl can easily change during the annual cycle due to their life-cycle traits and the presence of both migrants and residents in the population. Thus, we assessed the spatiotemporal variation in AI exposure risk in poultry due to spatial distribution changes in three duck species included in both major residents and wintering migrants in South Korea, the mandarin, mallard and spot-billed duck, during wintering (October-March), breeding (April-June) and whole annual seasons. To estimate seasonal ecological niche variations among the three duck species, we applied pairwise ecological niche analysis using the Pianka index. Subsequently, seasonal distribution models were projected by overlaying the monthly ranges estimated by the maximum entropy model. Finally, we overlaid each seasonal distribution range onto a poultry distribution map of South Korea. We found that the mandarin had less niche overlap with the mallard and spot-billed duck during the wintering season than during the breeding season, whereas the mallard had less niche overlap with the mandarin and spot-billed duck during the breeding season than during the wintering season. Breeding and annual distribution ranges of the mandarin and spot-billed duck, but not the mallard, were similar or even wider than their wintering ranges. Similarly, the mandarin and spot-billed duck showed more extensive overlap proportions between poultry and their distributional ranges during both the breeding and annual seasons than during the wintering season. These results suggest that potential AI exposure in poultry can occur more widely in the summer than in winter, depending on sympatry with the host duck species. Future studies considering the population density and variable pathogenicity of AI are required.","2022","AUG 2022","10.1111/tbed.14669","WOS:000835395600001"

Whether aridification leads to gradual (or abrupt) and systemic (or specific) changes in the biogeography of abundant and rare microbial species is largely unknown. Here, we investigated stress-adaptive changes (aridity-driven, ranging from 0.65 to 0.94) and biogeographic patterns of abundant and rare bacterial communities in different habitats, including agricultural field, forest, wetland, grassland, and desert, in desert oasis transition zones in northern China. We observed abrupt changes at the breakpoint of aridity values (0.92), characterized by diversity (alpha-diversity and beta-diversity), species coexistence, community assembly processes, and phylogenetic niche conservatism. Specifically, when aridity was <0.92, increasing aridity led to more deterministic assembly and species coexistences for the abundant subcommunity, whereas the reverse was observed for the rare subcommunity. The phylogenetic niche conservatism for both subcommunities increased slowly with aridity. When aridity was >0.92, the systemic responses of abundant and rare taxa changed dramatically in a consistent direction, such that both subcommunities rapidly tended to have a more deterministic assembly, species coexistence, and stronger phylogenetic niche conservatism with increasing aridity. In addition, the change rates of abundant taxa were higher than those of rare taxa, indicating the more sensitive responses of abundant taxa along aridity variation. This finding has important implications for understanding the impact of aridity on the structure and function of abundant and rare soil taxa and how diversity maintenance is associated with soil microbiota responding to global change. The abrupt threshold of soil bacteria found can be used for buffering and for building effective adaptation and mitigation measures aimed at maintaining the capacity of drylands for basic ecosystem functioning. IMPORTANCE Aridity, which is increasing worldwide due to climate change, affects the biodiversity and functions of dryland ecosystems. We provided the first statistical evidence for abrupt changes of species coexistence, ecological processes, and niche conservation of abundant and rare soil bacteria triggered by diversity to abrupt increases in aridity. The abrupt threshold of soil bacterial community response to aridity is spatially heterogeneous at the local scale and should be specified according to local conditions for buffering and for building effective adaptation and mitigation measures aimed at maintaining the capacity of drylands for basic ecosystem functioning.","2022",NA,NA,"WOS:000760939200010"

Many studies demonstrate the role of microbes in plant-soil feedbacks and their interactions with plants. However, interactions among microbes are seldom addressed, and there is no consensus regarding the nature and outcomes of interactions among microbial functional guilds. Scope Here, we critically review what is known about microbe-microbe interactions among functional guilds within the plant-soil system, with the aim to initiate a path to disentangling the microbe black-box. Our review confirms that the nature of microbial interactions among major functional guilds is explained by niche theory. This means that, among microbes, a competitive relationship is likely when their benefits to plants, source of carbon and nutrients, or nutrient scavenging mechanisms overlap, while a neutral-to-facilitative relationship is likely when these microbial traits differ or complement each other. Conclusions We highlight the numerous knowledge gaps and provide a framework to characterise microbe-microbe interactions that offers insight into the contributions of microbes to key ecosystem functions such as carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling.","2022","MAY 2022","10.1007/s11104-022-05479-1","WOS:000797769300003"
"Fridman, Y; Wang, ZH; Maslov, S; Goyal, A","Fine-scale diversity of microbial communities due to satellite niches in boom and bust environments","PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY","Recent observations have revealed that closely related strains of the same microbial species can stably coexist in natural and laboratory settings subject to boom and bust dynamics and serial dilutions, respectively. However, the possible mechanisms enabling the coexistence of only a handful of strains, but not more, have thus far remained unknown. Here, using a consumer-resource model of microbial ecosystems, we propose that by differentiating along Monod parameters characterizing microbial growth rates in high and low nutrient conditions, strains can coexist in patterns similar to those observed. In our model, boom and bust environments create satellite niches due to resource concentrations varying in time. These satellite niches can be occupied by closely related strains, thereby enabling their coexistence. We demonstrate that this result is valid even in complex environments consisting of multiple resources and species. In these complex communities, each species partitions resources differently and creates separate sets of satellite niches for their own strains. While there is no theoretical limit to the number of coexisting strains, in our simulations, we always find between 1 and 3 strains coexisting, consistent with known experiments and observations. Author Summary Recent genomic data have revealed the remarkable spectrum of microbial diversity in natural communities surrounding us, which harbor not only hundreds of species, but also a handful of closely related strains within each of those species (termed oligo-colonization). While the mechanisms behind species coexistence are much better studied, the mechanisms behind the coexistence of closely related strains have remained understudied. Here, using a simple consumer-resource model, we show that if strains differ on their Monod growth parameters, they can coexist even on a single limiting resource, provided that the environments, specifically resource concentrations, vary with time in boom and bust cycles. The Monod growth parameters describe how a strain's growth rate changes with resource concentration, namely the half-maximal concentration and maximal growth rate. Simulations of our model show that both in simple and complex environments, even though an arbitrary number of strains can coexist, typically it is between 1 and 3 strains of a species that coexist over several randomly assembled communities, consistent with some experimental observations. This is because the allowed parameter space for coexistence shrinks significantly with the number of strains that coexist.","2022",NA,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010244","WOS:000924483300001"

Particularly, the community dynamics of holobionts and the stability of host-microbe interactions under different thermal stresses remain largely unknown. In the present study, we holistically explored the physiology and growth of Acropora hyacinthus in response to increased temperatures (from 26 to 33 degrees C). We observed that bleaching corals with loss of algal symbionts reduced lipids and proteins to maintain their survival, leading to decreased tissue biomass and retarded growth. The diversity of Symbiodiniaceae and symbiont shuffling in the community structure was mainly caused by alterations in the relative abundance of the thermally sensitive but dominant clade C symbionts and low abundance of background types. Bacterial diversity showed a decreasing trend with increasing temperature, whereas no significant shifts were observed in the bacterial community structure. This finding might be attributed to the local adjustment of specific microbial community members that did not affect the overall metabolic state of the coral holobiont, and there was no increase in the proportion of sequences identified as typically pathogenic or opportunistic taxa. The Sloan neutral community model showed that neutral processes could explain 42.37-58.43% of bacterial community variation. The Stegen null model analysis indicates that the stochastic processes explain a significantly higher proportion of community assembly than deterministic processes when the temperature was elevated. The weak effect of temperature on the bacterial community structure and assembly might be related to an increase in stochastic dominance. The interaction of bacterial communities exhibits a fluctuating and simplistic trend with increasing temperature. Moreover, temperature increases were sufficient to establish the high stability of bacterial networks, and a non-linear response was found between the complexity and stability of the networks. Our findings collectively provide new insights into successive changes in the scleractinian coral host and holobionts in response to elevated seawater temperatures, especially the contribution of the community assembly process and species coexistence patterns to the maintenance of the coral-associated bacterial community.","2022",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2022.832081","WOS:000789126100001"

To tackle this theoretical question, we resorted to the Daisyworld as a toy model of the global ecosystem. We redesigned the original model to allow accounting for seed production, spreading, germination, and seedling development to mature seed-producing plants to describe how symbiotic and non-symbiotic daisy species differ in these key processes.

Despite abundant experimental evidence showing that the opportunity for coexistence decreases as niche overlap increases between species, bacterial species and strains competing for the same resources are commonly found across diverse spatially heterogeneous habitats. We thus hypothesized that the spatial scale of competition may play a key role in determining bacterial coexistence, and interact with other mechanisms that promote coexistence, including a growth-motility trade-off. To test this hypothesis, we let two Pseudomonas putida strains compete at local and regional scales by inoculating them either in a mixed droplet or in separate droplets in the same Petri dish, respectively. We also created conditions that allow the bacterial strains to disperse across abiotic or fungal hyphae networks. We found that competition at the local scale led to competitive exclusion while regional competition promoted coexistence. When competing in the presence of dispersal networks, the growth-motility trade-off promoted coexistence only when the strains were inoculated in separate droplets. Our results provide a mechanism by which existing laboratory data suggesting competitive exclusion at a local scale is reconciled with the widespread coexistence of competing bacterial strains in complex natural environments with dispersal.","2022",NA,"10.1098/rsos.211592","WOS:000894035200003"

Understanding range expansion is important for the study and successful management of ecosystems, with applications ranging from controlling bacterial biofilm formation in industrial and medical environments to large scale conservation programmes for species undergoing climate-change induced habitat disruption. During range expansion, species typically encounter competitors. Moreover, the spatial environment into which expansion takes place is almost always heterogeneous. Nevertheless, the impact of competition and spatial landscape heterogeneities on range expansion remains understudied. In this paper we present a theoretical framework comprising two competing generic species undergoing range expansion and use it to investigate the impact of spatial landscape heterogeneities on range expansion with a particular focus on its effect on competition dynamics. We reveal that the area covered by range expansion is highly variable due to the landscape heterogeneities. Moreover, we report significant variability in competitive outcome (relative abundance of a focal species), but determine that this is induced by low initial population densities and is independent of landscape heterogeneities. We further show that both area covered by range expansion and competitive outcome can be accurately predicted by a Voronoi tessellation with respect to an appropriate metric, which only requires information on the spatial landscape and the response of each species to that landscape. Finally, we reveal that if species interact antagonistically during range expansion, the dominant mode of competition depends on the initial population density; antagonistic actions determine competitive outcome if the initial population density is high, but competition for space is the dominant mode of competition if the initial population density is low. These findings enhance our understanding of how competition for space and antagonistic interactions affect range expansion in spatially heterogeneous environments and provide a predictive tool for future species-specific approaches.","2022","MAY 2022","10.1111/oik.09077","WOS:000802069500001"

Our results provide strong evidence of phylosymbiosis, though some closely-related species with substantial ecological niche overlap exhibited greater GM similarity than expected under Brownian motion. Phylogenetic regressions also showed a significant correlation between dietary guild and UniFrac diversity, but not Bray-Curtis or Jaccard. This discrepancy between beta diversity metrics suggests that older microbial clades have stronger associations with diet than younger clades, as UniFrac weights older clades more heavily. We conclude that GM diversity is predominantly shaped by host phylogeny, and that microbes associated with diet were likely acquired before evolutionary radiations within the lemur families examined.","2022",NA,"10.1038/s43705-022-00115-6","WOS:001105662100002"

Integrated aquaculture practices require an evaluation index system that includes a set of ecological indicators that characterize ecosystem changes for use in benefit assessment. In this study, two Ecopath models, white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei monoculture and integrated aquaculture using L. vannamei with the hard clam Mercenaria mercenaria, were constructed. Based on their representativeness and applicability, the 10 evaluation indicators output from the model were divided into four categories (trophic structure, niche competition, energy utilization and resistance to external disturbances) in order to construct an integrated aquaculture evaluation index system. The results showed that both the monoculture system and the integrated aquaculture system were composed of three integer trophic levels, with the highest effective trophic level being benthic (2.65). The effective trophic levels of L. vannamei in the monoculture and integrated aquaculture ecosystems were 2.03 and 2.02, respectively. The prey overlap index of L. vannamei and M. mercenaria in the integrated aquaculture ecosystem was 0.516, and M. mercenaria had a weak negative effect on L. vannamei. Functional groups with the highest ecotrophic efficiency (EE) values in the monoculture and integrated aquaculture systems were Artemia and microzooplankton, respectively. The EE values of phytoplankton, detritus and benthic bacteria in the integrated aquaculture system were higher than those in the monoculture system. The energy flowing to trophic level II and detritus accounted for 7.7% and 92.3% of the total primary production in the monoculture system, respectively, and accounted for 52.2% and 47.8% in the integrated aquaculture system, respectively. The calculated total net primary production/ total biomass (TPP/TB) and calculated total net primary production/ sum of all respiratory flows (TPP/TR) values of the integrated aquaculture system were lower than those of the monoculture system, while Finn's cycling index (FCL) and Finn's mean path length (FML) values were higher than those of the monoculture system. In general, compared with the monoculture system, the integrated aquaculture system showed no significant change in the trophic structure of each functional group, acceptable competition for ecological niches among cultured animals, substantially higher utilization of primary productivity and detritus, and greater system stability and resistance to disturbance. The integrated aquaculture evaluation index system provides a methodological basis for the development of new integrated aquaculture models and has implications for the evaluation of integrated aquaculture ecosystems.","2022","JUL 2022","10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109154","WOS:000870309400003"

Plants elicit changes in the soil microbiome that either promote or suppress conspecifics at the same location, thereby regulating population density-dependence and species co-existence. Such effects are often attributed to the accumulation of host-specific antagonistic or beneficial microbiota in the rhizosphere. However, the identity and host-specificity of the microbial taxa involved are rarely empirically assessed. Here we review the evidence for host-specificity in plant-associated microbes and propose that specific plant-soil feedbacks can also be driven by generalists. We outline the potential mechanisms by which generalist microbial pathogens, mutualists and decomposers can generate differential effects on plant hosts and synthesize existing evidence to predict these effects as a function of plant investments into defence, microbial mutualists and dispersal. Importantly, the capacity of generalist microbiota to drive plant-soil feedbacks depends not only on the traits of individual plants but also on the phylogenetic and functional diversity of plant communities.

Competition increased the shoot nitrogen, phosphorus and root myristic acid concentrations and relative expression of fatty acid transporter genes (RiFAT1 and RiFAT2) in AMF-colonized invasive plants, but decreased those in AMF-colonized native plants. Structural equation models indicated that the presence of AMF increased the uptake of phosphorus, but not nitrogen, by invasive plants, which probably provided more myristic acids to symbiotic AMF in return. These results suggest that invasive Asteraceae plants have greater mutualistic interactions with AMF than their phylogenetically related native counterparts, potentially contributing to invasion success.","2022","AUG 2022","10.1111/nph.18435","WOS:000847469500001"

Here, the authors investigate the response and assembly processes of bacterial communities adopted in two grasslands with different degrees of degradation. Stochastic processes dominated bacterial community assembly in response to grassland degradation. With an increase in degree of grassland degradation, bacterial richness decreased from 3526 to 2930 and from 3573 to 3021 in Grassland 1 (G1) and Grassland 2 (G2), respectively; however, functional gene richness increased from 6760 to 6887 and from 6851 to 7040 in G1 and G2, respectively. The KO gene numbers of each operational taxonomic units were positively correlated with standardized effect size measure of the mean nearest taxon distance (R-2 = 0.38 and 0.68 in G1 and G2, respectively), indicating that phylogenetic dispersion in community assembly under grassland degradation increases functional genes. Furthermore, different phyla exhibited distinct response strategies: Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, as r-strategists, exhibited positive productivity, with increases in diversity, abundance, and niche breadth; other phyla exhibited greater phylogenetic dispersion, and less diversity and niche overlap, highlighting the role of K-strategists in improving resource-use efficiency in response to nutrient loss. The transition of communities from K- to r-strategists could help communities adapt to environmental disturbance. The results enhance our understanding of bacterial community assembly and ecology-associated functions in underground grassland ecosystems, which could facilitate degradation prediction and grassland management.","2022","MAY 2022","10.1002/ldr.4304","WOS:000796874600001"

We conducted a rain simulation experiment combined with in situ (15) N labeling of three nitrogen (N) forms (NO3-, NH4+, glycine) to investigate how the frequency of extreme precipitation influences plant productivity and N acquisition (N uptake, (15) N recovery, and preference for N form) by the dominant species Stipa grandis and soil microorganisms in the temperate steppe. Extreme precipitation had three frequencies (1, 3, and 6 events for low, medium, and high frequency) with the same total rain amount in 1-month cycle. The low frequency reduced the S. grandis biomass by 39%, whereas the high ones raised the S. grandis biomass by 43% and increased plant and microbial N uptake up to 6.3-fold and 5.1-fold of those under ambient precipitation, respectively. Plants preferred NO3- and microorganisms preferred NH4+ under low frequency, but they showed similar preference for three N forms, leading to chemical niche overlap for NO3-, NH4+, and glycine under high frequency. This indicated that high precipitation frequency effectively reduced the proportion of each N form, which plants and microorganisms competed for as the available N pool increased. Overall, the increase of precipitation frequency (decreasing intensity) shifted the extreme (low frequency but high intensity) to optimal conditions for plant productivity and N acquisition by plants and microorganisms in the temperate steppe. These findings provide new insights for understanding the diverse responses of ecosystem functions to extreme climate events.","2022","DEC 2021","10.1007/s00374-021-01608-7","WOS:000734142500002"

We investigated the spatial variation and drivers of microbial communities in the topsoil (0-20 cm) of Robinia pseudoacacia forests at the regional scale on the Loess Plateau. Soil bacterial and fungal com-munities showed a significant distance decay pattern, and fungi exhibited a more apparent spatial pattern than bacteria. Microbial diversity (Shannon-Wiener and Chao1 indexes) and the relative abundance of Actinobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Nitrospirae, Latescibacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Rozellomycota significantly differed among regions. Community dissimilarities of bacterial and fungal indicator species were sensitive to changes in mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP), respectively. However, the first axis of nonmetric multidimensional scaling (nMDS1) of soil bacterial and fungal communities were respectively asso-ciated with soil pH and MAP. The proportion of positive links of co-occurrence networks between microor-ganisms increased with the decrease in MAP, suggesting that the decrease in precipitation increases species coexistence. Soil bacterial and fungal community assemblies were both dominated by stochastic processes and were well predicted by the neutral community model. The effects of soil properties were larger on bacteria than fungi, and soil properties respectively explained 54.54% and 37.29% of the total variation in the bacterial and fungal community compositions. The major drivers of community dissimilarity varied between bacteria and fungi, indicating that bacterial community was mainly drove by soil pH, NH4+ and geographic distance and fungal community was mainly drove by MAP, pH and geographic distance.

In this work, we explored the spatial distribution and association networks of bacteria and fungi in the rhizosphere of broomcorn millet selected from 12 locations across northern China using high-throughput sequencing. We decomposed the beta-diversity into species turnover and nestedness, confirming that the bacterial and fungal beta-diversity in the broomcorn millet rhizosphere was almost entirely linked to species turnover. Distance-decay relationships revealed that the biogeographic patterns of rhizosphere bacterial and fungal beta-diversity (including species turnover rather than nestedness) were clearly distinct. Environmental selection was the only factor determining the rhizosphere bacterial beta-diversity, whereas the rhizosphere fungal beta-diversity was governed by both environmental selection and dispersal limitation. We also demonstrated that mean annual temperature (MAT) and pH were the major ecological drivers regulating the bacterial and fungal community structure, keystone species, and modularisation in the broomcorn millet rhizosphere. This elucidated different mechanisms of bacterial and fungal biogeographic and co-occurrence patterns in the broomcorn millet rhizosphere, and provided new ideas and basic insights for an in-depth understanding of the biogeography and coexistence theory of broomcorn millet rhizosphere ecosystems.","2022","MAR 2022","10.1007/s11104-022-05349-w","WOS:000769821100004"

Here, we assessed the environmental conditions influencing the development stages of Atlantic Calanus finmarchicus and Arctic Calanus glacialis, and we quantified the extent to which their niches overlap by incorporating multiple environmental data. We based our analysis on a 3-year seasonal collection of zooplankton by sediment traps, located on moorings in two contrasting Svalbard fjords: the Arctic Rijpfjorden and the Atlantic-influenced Kongsfjorden. Despite large differences in water temperature between the fjords, local realized ecological niches of the sibling Calanus species overlapped almost perfectly. The exception was the earliest copepodites of C. glacialis in Rijpfjorden, which probably utilized the local ice algal bloom in spring. However, during periods with no sea ice, like in Kongsfjorden, the siblings of both Calanus species showed high synchronization in the population structure. Interestingly, differences in temperature preferences of C. finmarchicus and C. glacialis were much higher between the studied fjords than between the species. Our analysis confirmed the high plasticity of Calanus copepods and their abilities to adapt to highly variable environmental settings, not only on an interannual basis but also in a climate warming context, indicating some resilience in the Calanus community.","2022",NA,"10.1002/ece3.9569","WOS:000894343400001"

However, few studies have assessed effects on PSFs under field conditions or the mechanisms involved. We assessed drought effects on PSFs of four common grassland species (Lolium multiflorum, Medicago sativa, Plantago lanceolata, and Trifolium repens) in situ in a mesic grassland under ambient rainfall and prolonged drought conditions using a long-term rainfall manipulation system. The four species were first grown in monocultures in sub-plots of each of six ambient and drought plots to condition the soils. Then, each species was grown in a sub-plot conditioned by the same species ('home') and a sub-plot conditioned by each of the other three species ('away'). We found that three species (L. multiflorum, M. sativa and T. repens) produced higher biomass in their 'home' soil than away soil under ambient rainfall while they consistently grew better in away soil under drought conditions, indicating drought-induced negative shifts in PSFs. There were strong interaction effects of rainfall treatment and conditioning species on several phospholipid-derived fatty acids markers, including a marker associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). We found a significant positive correlation between PSFs and the AMF marker across all treatment combinations, indicating that PSFs were driven by changes in positive plant-soil biotic interactions. Furthermore, drought increased plant parasitic nematode abundances. We found a strong significant negative correlation between PSFs and plant parasitic nematodes across all treatment combinations, indicating that the drought-induced shifts to more negative PSFs were driven by increased negative plant-soil biotic interactions. Drought may therefore negatively impact common grassland species due to stronger negative PSFs but at the same time promote species co-existence by reducing the abundance of competitive species.","2022","JUL 2022","10.1016/j.soilbio.2022.108772","WOS:000828211000001"

We obtain sufficient conditions for existence, persistence and extinction of the stochastic system. In relation to the therapy control, we also analyze the stochasticity role of equilibrium point stabilities. The Monte Carlo algorithm is used to estimate the mean extinction time and the extinction probability of cancer cells or viruses-specific CTLs. Our simulations highlighted the switch of the system leaving the attractor basin of the three species co-existence equilibrium toward that of cancer cell extinction or that of virus-specific CTLs depletion. This allowed us to characterize the spaces of cancer control parameters. Finally, we determine the model solution robustness by analyzing the sensitivity of the model characteristic parameters.

"Hashem, I; Van Impe, JFM","A Game Theoretic Analysis of the Dual Function of Antibiotics","FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY","There are two major views toward the role of antibiotics in microbial social interactions. The classical view is that antibiotics serve as weapons, produced by a bacterial species, at a significant cost, to inhibit the growth of its competitors. This view is supported by observations that antibiotics are usually upregulated by stress responses that infer the intensity of ecological competition, such as nutrient limitation and cellular damage, which point out to a competitive role for antibiotics. The other ecological function frequently assigned to antibiotics is that they serve as signaling molecules which regulate the collective behavior of a microbial community. Here, we investigate the conditions at which a weapon can serve as a signal in the context of microbial competition. We propose that an antibiotic will serve as a signal whenever a potential alteration of the growth behavior of the signal receiver, in response to a subinhibitory concentration (SIC) of the antibiotic, reduces the competitive pressure on the signal producer. This in turn would lead to avoiding triggering the stress mechanisms of the signal producer responsible for further antibiotics production. We show using individual-based modeling that this reduction of competitive pressure on the signal producer can happen through two main classes of responses by the signal recipient: competition tolerance, where the recipient reduces its competitive impact on the signal producer by switching to a low growth rate/ high yield strategy, and niche segregation, where the recipient reduces the competitive pressure on the signal producer by reducing their niche overlap. Our hypothesis proposes that antibiotics serve as signals out of their original function as weapons in order to reduce the chances of engaging in fights that would be costly to both the antibiotic producer as well as to its competitors.","2022",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2021.812788","WOS:000764309200001"

Bacteria with a generalist life style, however, can actively shift between these two habitats. Globally increasing densities of natural and artificial particles enhance habitat heterogeneity, with potential consequences for system stability and trophic transfer through aquatic food webs. To better decipher the dynamics of microbial communities, we investigated the influence of adaptive vs. fixed habitat choice on species coexistence for a simplified bacterial community by analyzing a corresponding food web model, consisting of two specialist bacterial prey species (free and attached), a generalist bacterial prey species with the ability to shift between both habitats, and two protist predators, specialized on either water or particle compartment. For simplicity we assume a shared resource pool, considering particles only for colonization but not as a source for nutrients or carbon, that is, inert particles like microplastics or inorganic sediments. The model predicts coexistence on a cyclic attractor between fixed and flexible bacteria, if the costs for adaptive habitat choice can be balanced by adaptation speed. The presence of adaptive prey dampens predator-prey cycle amplitudes, contributing to system stabilization resulting in higher mean predator biomass compared to specialist prey only. Thus, in pelagic microbial systems, flexible habitat choice at the prey level has important implications for system stability and magnitude of energy flow through the microbial loop.","2022","APR 2022","10.1002/lno.12091","WOS:000783519200001"

The number of locally coexisting species often vastly exceeds the number of identifiable niches, and taxonomic composition often appears decoupled from local environmental conditions. This is contrary to the view that environmental conditions should select for a few locally well-adapted species. Here we use an individual-based eco-evolutionary model to show that virtually unlimited taxonomic diversity can be supported in highly evolving assemblages, even in the absence of niche separation. With a steady stream of heritable changes to phenotype, competitive exclusion may be weakened, allowing sustained coexistence of nearly neutral phenotypes with highly divergent lineages. This behaviour is robust even to abrupt environmental perturbations that might be expected to cause strong selection pressure and an associated loss of diversity. We, therefore, suggest that rapid evolution and individual-level variability are key drivers of species coexistence and maintenance of microbial biodiversity.","2022","JUN 2022","10.1111/ele.14061","WOS:000816751600001"

The non-hibernating small mammals increase metabolic rate including obligatory thermogenesis (basal/resting metabolic rate, BMR/RMR) and regulatory thermogenesis (mainly nonshivering thermogenesis, NST, in brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle) to maintain thermal homeostasis in cold conditions. A substantial amount of evidence indicates that the symbiotic gut microbiota are sensitive to air temperature, and play an important function in cold-induced thermoregulation, via bacterial metabolites and byproducts such as short-chain fatty acids and secondary bile acids. Cold signal is sensed by specific thermosensitive transient receptor potential channels (thermo-TRPs), and then norepinephrine (NE) is released from sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and thyroid hormones also increase to induce NST. Meanwhile, these neurotransmitters and hormones can regulate the diversity and compositions of the gut microbiota. Therefore, cold-induced NST is controlled by both Thermo-TRPs-SNS-gut microbiota axis and thyroid-gut microbiota axis. Besides physiological thermoregulation, small mammals also rely on behavioral regulation, such as huddling and coprophagy, to maintain energy and thermal homeostasis, and the gut microbial community is involved in these processes. The present review summarized the recent progress in the gut microbiota and host physiological and behavioral thermoregulation in small mammals for better understanding the evolution and adaption of holobionts (host and symbiotic microorganism). The coevolution of host-microorganism symbionts promotes individual survival, population maintenance, and species coexistence in the ecosystems with complicated, variable environments.","2022",NA,"10.3389/fphys.2022.888324","WOS:000792065800001"

Northern peatlands are important ecosystems in middle-high latitude regions. In peatlands, different vegetation successions occur with changes in groundwater levels. The overall carbon emission of peat bogs is related to the carbon stability of the surrounding environment. Unraveling the assembly and distribution of bacterial communities at different succession stages in peatland is essential to understanding the soil nutrient cycle. In this study, we investigated the characteristics of soil carbon emissions and the composition of subsurface microorganisms under six different succession stages. The highest carbon emission was observed in mossy peatlands, and their soil enzyme activity was closely related to the aboveground vegetation cover type. The succession pattern of ground vegetation was the main driver of soil microorganisms. The abundance of the dominant Proteobacteria decreased with increasing soil depth, while the opposite trend was observed for Chloroflexi. Furthermore, the community structure of microorganisms became progressively simpler and looser as soil water content decreased. The bacterial alpha diversity was driven by soil dissolved organic carbon and Fe, and the beta diversity was driven mainly by soil water content. The bacteria presented a random distribution in a nutrient-rich soil environment and shifted to deterministic distribution with decreasing water and nutrient contents. The balance between taxonomic diversity and dispersal limitation mediates species coexistence in the soil microbiome.

Additionally, the changes in the ranking of important values along with the progress of the forest succession were consistent with the niche width calculated by the previous stage of the plant community. The results of niche overlap, Pearson's correlation and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and significance indicated that in the early stage of succession, tree species did not fully utilize environmental resources. Then, as time went by, the number of negative correlations of plants in the early-mid stage was more than that in the mid stage of succession. Significant differences were found in the species richness of soil microorganisms among the three successional stages.

We found that soil pH decreased while soil water content (SWC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and total potassium (TK) tended to increase with the increase in C. japonica abundance. In contrast, soil available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP) and available potassium (AK) content declined by 26.1%similar to 49.3% under the high level of C. japonica abundance. A gradual decrease in relative abundance of Acidobacteria and Chloroflexi while a pronounced increase in relative abundance of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were observed with increase of C. japonica abundance. Alternations in bacterial composition were closely related to changes in AP and AK, while the change of fungal structure was mainly related to SWC, soil organic carbon (SOC) and pH, indicating that bacterial community was sensitive to declines in soil available nutrients and fungal structure was sensitive to changes in soil physicochemical properties (i.e., pH and SWC) and organic carbon resource. Understory plants had the highest alpha-diversity in forest containing moderate abundance of C. japonica, which might be related to the high bacterial diversity.

The mechanisms by which intestinal microbes can interact, however, remain poorly mapped and are often modeled as spatially unstructured competitions for chemical resources. Recent imaging studies examining the zebrafish gut have shown that patterns of aggregation are central to bacterial population dynamics. In this study, we focus on bacterial species of genera Aeromonas and Enterobacter. Two zebrafish gut-derived isolates, Aeromonas ZOR0001 (AE) and Enterobacter ZOR0014 (EN), when mono-associated with the host, are highly aggregated and located primarily in the intestinal midgut. An Aeromonas isolate derived from the commensal strain, Aeromonas-MB4 (AE-MB4), differs from the parental strain in that it is composed mostly of planktonic cells localized to the anterior gut. When challenged by AE-MB4, clusters of EN rapidly fragment into non-motile, slowgrowing, dispersed individual cells with overall abundance two orders of magnitude lower than the mono-association value. In the presence of a certain set of additional gut bacterial species, these effects on EN are dampened. In particular, if AE-MB4 invades an already established multi-species community, EN persists in the form of large aggregates. These observations reveal an unanticipated competition mechanism based on manipulation of bacterial spatial organization, namely dissolution of aggregates, and provide evidence that multi-species communities may facilitate stable intestinal co-existence.","2022","SEP 2022","10.1016/j.bpj.2022.08.010","WOS:000928436300001"

The different types of organic matter jointly enriched Ramlibacter, Sphingomonas and Adhaeribacter OTUs in the Populus rhizosphere. Amendment with organic matter improved network complexity and stability but had little effect on the species composition of the rhizosphere network at the phylum level. Conclusions Increased network stability was found in the Populus rhizosphere with organic amendments. These results highlight that organic matter input increased the diversity and network interactions in the Populus rhizosphere, indicated promoting species coexistence caused by resource availability improvement.","2022","FEB 2021","10.1007/s11104-021-04859-3","WOS:000615110700001"

We explore this paradox by evaluating the dynamics generated by symbiont competition for plant resources and the plant's preferential allocation to the most beneficial symbiont using a system of differential equations representing the densities of mutualistic and nonmutualistic symbionts and the level of preferentially allocated and nonpreferentially allocated resources for which the symbionts compete. We find that host preferential allocation and costs of mutualism generate resource specialization that makes the coexistence of beneficial and nonbeneficial symbionts possible. Furthermore, coexistence becomes likely because of negative physiological feedbacks in host preferential allocation. We find that biologically realistic models of plant physiology and symbiont competition predict that the coexistence of beneficial and nonbeneficial symbionts should be common in root symbioses and that the density and relative abundance of mutualists should increase in proportion to the needs of the host.","2022","APR 2022","10.1086/718643","WOS:000760446200001"

While seedling recruitment studies and cross-biome patterns of plant diversity and mycorrhizal dominance support this hypothesis, it remains to be tested at the forest stand level over continental scales. Here, we analyse approximately 82,000 forest plots across the USA to show that both ectomycorrhizal-dominated and arbuscular mycorrhizal-dominated forests show relatively low tree diversity, while forests with a mixture of mycorrhizal strategies support a higher number of tree species. Our findings suggest that mycorrhizal dominance, rather than mycorrhizal type, shapes tree diversity in forests. Associations with mycorrhizal fungi can affect many aspects of plant ecology, including the structuring of plant communities at large spatial scales. Here, the authors use forest inventory plot data to show that tree species diversity is highest in plots with mixed presence of arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal fungi, while plots with dominance by either fungal type have lower diversity.","2022","FEB 2022","10.1038/s41559-021-01634-6","WOS:000761869000007"

To clarify the behavior of H. albidus and its spatial and temporal niche overlap with the invasive relative, we used light microscopy, fungal species-specific qPCR assays, and PacBio long-read amplicon sequencing of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region to examine fungal growth and species composition in attached leaves of European ash. The plant material was collected from a healthy stand in central Norway, where ash saplings in late autumn showed leaflet vein necrosis like that commonly related to H. fraxineus. For reference, leaflet samples were analyzed from stands with epidemic level of ash dieback in southeastern Norway and Estonia. While H. albidus was predominant in the necrotic veins in the healthy stand, H. fraxineus was predominant in the diseased stands. Otherwise, endophytes with pathogenic potential in the genera Venturia (anamorph Fusicladium), Mycosphaerella (anamorph Ramularia), and Phoma, and basidiomycetous yeasts formed the core leaflet mycobiome both in the healthy and diseased stands. In necrotic leaf areas with high levels of either H. albidus or H. fraxineus DNA, one common feature was the high colonization of sclerenchyma and phloem, a region from which the ascomata of both species arise. Our data suggest that H. albidus can induce necrosis in ash leaves, but that owing to low infection pressure, this first takes place in tissues weakened by autumn senescence, 1-2 months later in the season than what is characteristic of H. fraxineus at an epidemic phase of ash dieback. The most striking difference between these fungi would appear to be the high fecundity of H. fraxineus. The adaptation to a host that is phylogenetically closely related to European ash, a tree species with high occurrence frequency in Europe, and the presence of environmental conditions favorable to H. fraxineus life cycle completion in most years may enable the build-up of high infection pressure and challenge of leaf defense prior to autumn senescence.","2022",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2022.892051","WOS:000811300300001"

Previous studies investigating P. gorzugi diet have focused on the population occupying the Black River drainage in southeastern New Mexico, while Texas populations have remained unexamined. During the summer and fall of 2020, we studied the dietary habits of P. gorzugi and the syntopic red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans) at San Felipe Creek, Texas, USA using fecal content and stable isotope analyses. We also compared the isotopic niches of these 2 co-occurring turtle species. Filamentous algae were, volumetrically, the most important food item for male, female, and juvenile P. gorzugi. Stable isotope mixing models indicated that lotic and lentic filamentous algae had the greatest proportional contribution to P. gorzugi and T. s. elegans diets, respectively. Stable isotope dietary mixing models also indicate T. s. elegans had a more carnivorous diet, composed mostly of red-rimmed melania (Melanoides tuberculata) and red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii). Carnivory in this species was further supported by enriched delta N-15 values and higher trophic position estimates. Pseudemys gorzugi and T. s. elegans had delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures that significantly differed, and the 2 species showed little overlap in isotopic niche space, suggesting a low likelihood of intense resource competition. Our results demonstrate that the diet of P. gorzugi, and the isotopic niche overlap between P. gorzugi and T. s. elegans at San Felipe Creek differ from that in the Black River drainage of New Mexico.

Sampling was conducted from 2002 to 2015 in two biotopes (river and lake) of the Ivinheima River basin, Brazil. In the river, abundance was similar between species, whereas, in the lake, P. ambrosettii differed from the other species, showing high abundance. Diet analysis revealed a predominance of detritus, plant material, and algae. Pterygoplichthys ambrosettii and L. platymetopon presented distinct diets. By contrast, the three Hypostomus consumed the same resources. We found trophic differences between the two biotopes. Niche breadth and overlap showed that similarity in the diet cannot explain species coexistence, but the high availability of the consumed items supports resource partitioning, promoting coexistence. However, the high population size of P. ambrosetti suggests a possible competitive relationship, potentially harming native species.

However, it is unclear how many protist species truly coexist in this miniaturized environment, and moreover, it is difficult to define the fundamental unit of protist diversity. Species delineation of termite gut protists has therefore been guided without a theory-based concept of species. Here, we focused on the hindgut of the termite Reticulitermes speratus, where 10 or 11 morphologically distinct oxymonad cell types, that is, morphospecies, coexist. We elucidated the phylogenetic structure of all co-occurring oxymonads and addressed whether their diversity can be explained by the ecotype hypothesis. Oxymonad-specific 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing analyses of whole-gut samples, combined with single-cell 18S rRNA sequencing of the oxymonad morphospecies, identified 210 one-nucleotide-level variants. The phylogenetic analysis of these variants revealed the presence of microdiverse clusters typically within 1% sequence divergence. Each known oxymonad morphospecies comprised one to several monophyletic or paraphyletic microdiverse clusters. Using these sequence data sets, we conducted computational simulation to predict the rates of ecotype formation and periodic selection, and to demarcate putative ecotypes. Our simulations suggested that the oxymonad genetic divergence is constrained primarily by strong selection, in spite of limited population size and possible bottlenecks during intergenerational transmission. A total of 33 oxymonad ecotypes were predicted, and most of the putative ecotypes were consistently detected among different colonies and host individuals. These findings provide a possible theoretical basis for species diversity and underlying mechanisms of coexistence of termite gut protists.","2022","DEC 2021","10.1111/mec.16309","WOS:000731094600001"

ECM and AM differ in strategies for acquiring nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), however, little is known about the degree to which mycorrhiza mediate the effects of tree species on soil P bioavailability outside of the temperate zone. Here, we established a natural gradient with increasing ECM tree dominance in subtropical secondary forests, and investigated the linkages between the ECM tree dominance and soil bioavailable P content. We quantified the contents of four soil bioavailable P pools (CaCl2-P, citric-P, enzyme-P and HCl-P) using the recently developed biologically-based P extraction method, as well as acid phosphatase activity, litter biomass and quality, microbial biomass carbon (C), and soil abiotic variables. We found that CaCl2-P, citric-P and HCl-P increased with ECM tree dominance, while enzyme-P did not. Specially, ECM-dominated soils displayed markedly higher (1.2-2.9 times) citric-P and HCl-P than AM soils, indicating that ECM forests can effectively obtain inorganic P by releasing organic acids and through proton excretion. The acid phosphatase involved in the acquisition of organic P had similar activity between AM and ECM forests. Structural equation models indicated that increasing ECM tree dominance increases litter C/N ratio and soil organic matter, but decreases pH and microbial biomass C/P ratio, all of which are critical in mediating P bioavailability. Collectively, our findings confirm that tree mycorrhizal associations affect soil P bioavailability, which have implications for understanding species coexistence and guiding forest managements in subtropics.","2022","JUL 2022","10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120435","WOS:000878533000001"

Herein, we compared the turnover and networks of foxtail millet, proso millet, and sorghum rhizosphere bacterial communities across nine paired fields in northern China. Remarkable differences in community composition, diversity between three minor grain crops, and the influence of region on these indicators was greater than that of crop type. Community richness of foxtial millet, proso millet, and sorgum showed a unimodal curve with latitude increased. Compared to spatial factors, environmental variables had greater effects on the rhizosphere bacterial community turnover in three minor grain crops. Edaphic variables were more important than climatic variables for rhizosphere bacterial community composition in foxtail millet fields. In addition, soil organic matter (OM) and total nitrogen (TN) were the key factors influencing the turnover of rhizosphere communities in foxtail millet and sorghum. In contrast, pH and TN were important factors influencing the turnover of rhizosphere communities in proso millet. Rhizosphere bacterial networks were more closely interconnected in proso millet fields than in the other two crops, showing the lower average path length and diameter, greater average clustering, and graph density. In addition, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Acidobacteria played major roles in the rhizosphere bacterial network structures and were predicted to maintain generalist metabolic diversity.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are key plant symbionts that can affect plant community dynamics and ecosystem stability. However, knowledge about how AM fungal communities respond to climate extremes in natural ecosystems remains elusive. Based on a grassland extreme drought experiment in Inner Mongolia, we investigated the response of AM fungal communities to extreme drought in association with plant communities. The experiment simulated two types of extreme drought (chronic/intense) of once-in-20-year occurrence. AM fungal richness and community composition exhibited high sensitivity to extreme drought and were more sensitive to intense drought than chronic drought. This community sensitivity (i.e. decline in richness and shifts in community composition) of AM fungi can be jointly explained by soil moisture, plant richness, and aboveground productivity. Notably, the robustness of the plant-AM fungal community co-response increased with drought intensity. Our results indicate that AM fungal communities are sensitive to climate extremes, and we propose that the plant community mediates AM fungal community responses. Given the ubiquitous nature of AM associations, their climate sensitivity may have profound consequences on plant communities and ecosystem stability under climate change.","2022","SEP 2021","10.1111/nph.17692","WOS:000695513500001"

We researched how these different mycorrhizal associations affect rhizosphere soil nutrient economy in these calcareous soils. Methods Bulk and rhizosphere soils were sampled beneath 25 AM and 9 ECM plants growing in primary forests at the Puding Karst Critical Zone Observatory. Nutrient contents and potential enzyme activities were analyzed to test the effect of different types of mycorrhizal association on rhizosphere soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) economies. Results The contents of nitrate-N and available-P were markedly lower in the rhizospheres of ECM plants compared to AM plants. Ectomycorrhizal plants promoted relatively greater investment in N-acquisition enzymes, in contrast, AM plants caused relatively greater investment in P-acquisition enzymes. The decreased pH in the rhizospheres of AM plants likely promoted the greater P availability. Conclusion Our results revealed how plants that form contrasting mycorrhizal associations have fundamentally different effects on rhizospheric nutrient economies in the low fertility karst soils of southwest China. Differentiation in N- and P-acquisition capacity of these plants have implications for species coexistence and the high levels of plant biodiversity observed in these forests.","2022","APR 2021","10.1007/s11104-021-04950-9","WOS:000642833500001"

Understanding the ecological and evolutionary factors that increase the likelihood of disease agents infecting and establishing in a novel host is therefore an important research area. Previous work across different pathogens, including rabies virus (RABV), found that increased evolutionary distance between hosts reduces the frequency of cross-species transmission and of permanent host shifts. However, whether this effect of host relatedness still holds for transmission among recently diverged hosts is not well understood. We aimed to ask if high host relatedness can still increase the probability of a host shift between more recently diverged hosts, and the importance of this effect relative to ecological predictors. We first addressed this question by quantifying the CST frequency of RABV between North American bat species within the genus Myotis, using a multi-decade data set containing 128 nucleoprotein (N) RABV sequences from ten host species. We compared RABV CST frequency within Myotis to the rates of CST between nine genera of North American bat species. We then examined whether host relatedness or host range overlap better explains the frequency of CST seen between Myotis species. We found that at the within genus scale, host range overlap, rather than host relatedness best explains the frequency of CST events. Moreover, we found evidence of CST occurring among a higher proportion of species, and CST more frequently resulting in sustained transmission in the novel host in the Myotis dataset compared to the multi-genus dataset. Our results suggest that among recently diverged species, the ability to infect a novel host is no longer restricted by physiological barriers but instead is limited by physical contact. Our results improve predictions of where future CST events for RABV might occur and clarify the relationship between host divergence and pathogen emergence.","2022",NA,"10.3390/v14112399","WOS:000881468300001"

With Michaelis-Menten or Monod growth functions, it is well known that the model can have a unique positive equilibrium which is unstable as long as it exists. If a non monotonic growth rate is considered (which is the case when there is substrate inhibition), it is shown that a new positive equilibrium point exists which can be stable according to the operating parameters of the system. We describe its operating diagram, which is the bifurcation diagram giving the behavior of the system with respect to the operating parameters. By means of this bifurcation diagram, we show that the general model presents a set of fifteen possible behaviors: washout, competitive exclusion of one species, coexistence, multi-stability, occurrence of stable limit cycles through a super-critical Hopf bifurcations, homoclinic bifurcations and flip bifurcation.

In this contribution, we explore the effects of flexible associations between fully fledged viruses and subviral entities, such as virus satellites, in viral dynamics and, in particular, in stable viral coexistence. We devise a mathematical model to compare different situations of competition between two viruses and to quantify how the association with a satellite qualitatively modifies dynamical equilibria. The relevant parameter is the invasion fitness of each virus or of the virus-satellite tandem, which in the model depends on the transmission rate of viruses and on their effect on host survival. In a virus-virus competition, one of the viruses becomes eventually extinct, recasting the competitive exclusion law of ecology. However, an association with a satellite might change the outcome of the competition in two ways, either to favor the less competitive virus (regardless of whether it is the helper virus or not) or to allow for the stable coexistence of the two viruses and the satellite. The virus-satellite association differs from other mechanisms proposed in ecology to date to enhance species coexistence. We hypothesize that such an association constitutes a parsimonious evolutionary pathway towards more stable cooperative associations, such as bipartite viral forms, a collaborative association unique to viruses.","2022",NA,"10.3389/fviro.2022.929851","WOS:001087803600001"
"Cook, SC; Back, JA; King, RS","Compensatory dynamics of lotic algae break down nonlinearly with increasing nutrient enrichment","ECOLOGY","One important mechanism governing the temporal maintenance of biodiversity is asynchrony in co-occurring competitors due to fluctuating environments (i.e., compensatory dynamics). Temporal niche partitioning has evolved in response to predictable oscillations in environmental conditions so that species may offset competition, but we do not yet have a clear understanding of how novel anthropogenic stressors alter seasonal patterns of succession. Many primary producers are nutrient limited, and enrichment may decrease the importance of environmental fluctuations that govern which species are effective competitors under naturally low nutrient regimes. Consequently, elevated nutrient concentrations may synchronize species responses to seasonality. By studying benthic algal assemblages over 2 years from 35 streams that spanned a wide gradient of nutrient enrichment, we found that compensatory dynamics characterizing seasonal succession under natural nutrient regimes broke down at relatively low levels of total phosphorus (P) enrichment (similar to 25 mu g/L). With increasing P more species were able to coexist at any given time, and seasonal variation in assemblage composition was characterized by synchronous swings in species biovolumes. We also observed much higher instability in assemblage biovolumes with declines in compensatory dynamics, which indicates that anthropogenic alteration of nutrient regimes can affect community stability by changing the dominant mode of seasonal succession. Our findings indicate that compensatory fluctuations of stream algae are driven by seasonality and provide insight about how nutrient enrichment alters evolved drivers of species coexistence.","2022","MAR 2022","10.1002/ecy.3613","WOS:000769193900001"

Nonetheless, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus are commonly isolated from chronically infected, nonhealing wounds and lungs of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Therefore, we hypothesized that S. aureus could protect itself from P. aeruginosa through glucose-derived metabolites, such as small organic acids, preventing it from being eradicated. This in vitro study demonstrated that S. aureus populations, in the presence of glucose, secrete one or more substances that efficiently eradicate P. aeruginosa in a concentration-dependent manner. These substances had a molecular mass lower than three kDa, were hydrophilic, heat- and proteinase-resistant, and demonstrated a pH-dependent effect. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis identified acetoin, acetic acid, and oligopeptides or cyclic peptides in glucose-grown S. aureus supernatants. All the tested wild-type and clinical S. aureus strain inhibited P. aeruginosa growth. Thus, we proposed a model in which a cocktail of these compounds, produced by established S. aureus populations in glucose presence, facilitated these two species' coexistence in chronic infections. IMPORTANCE Chronic infections affect a growing part of the population and are associated with high societal and personal costs. Multiple bacterial species are often present in these infections, and multispecies infections are considered more severe than single-species infections. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa often coexist in chronic infections. However, the interactions between these two species and their coexistence in chronic infections are not fully understood. By exploring in vitro interactions, we found a novel S. aureus-mediated inhibition of P. aeruginosa, and we suggested a model of the coexistence of the two species in chronic infections.

Subsequently, H2O2 is reduced by MtrCAB to facilitate DmsEFAB-mediated extracellular reduction of iodate. To investigate the distribution of bacteria with the capability for extracellular reduction of iodate, bacterial genomes were systematically searched for both dmsEFAB and mtrCAB gene clusters. The dmsEFAB and mtrCAB gene clusters were found in three Ferrimonas and 26 Shewanella species. Coexistence of both dmsEFAB and mtrCAB gene clusters in these bacteria suggests their potentials for extracellular reduction of iodate. Further analyses demonstrated that these bacteria were isolated from a variety of ecosystems, including the lakes, rivers, and subsurface rocks in East and Southeast Asia, North Africa, and North America.

"Khalighi, M; Sommeria-Klein, G; Gonze, D; Faust, K; Lahti, L","Quantifying the impact of ecological memory on the dynamics of interacting communities","PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY","Ecological memory refers to the influence of past events on the response of an ecosystem to exogenous or endogenous changes. Memory has been widely recognized as a key contributor to the dynamics of ecosystems and other complex systems, yet quantitative community models often ignore memory and its implications. Recent modeling studies have shown how interactions between community members can lead to the emergence of resilience and multistability under environmental perturbations. We demonstrate how memory can be introduced in such models using the framework of fractional calculus. We study how the dynamics of a well-characterized interaction model is affected by gradual increases in ecological memory under varying initial conditions, perturbations, and stochasticity. Our results highlight the implications of memory on several key aspects of community dynamics. In general, memory introduces inertia into the dynamics. This favors species coexistence under perturbation, enhances system resistance to state shifts, mitigates hysteresis, and can affect system resilience both ways depending on the time scale considered. Memory also promotes long transient dynamics, such as long-standing oscillations and delayed regime shifts, and contributes to the emergence and persistence of alternative stable states. Our study highlights the fundamental role of memory in communities, and provides quantitative tools to introduce it in ecological models and analyse its impact under varying conditions. Author summary An ecosystem is said to exhibit ecological memory when its future states do not only depend on its current state but also on its initial state and trajectory. Memory may arise through various mechanisms as organisms adapt to their environment, modify it, and accumulate biotic and abiotic material. It may also emerge from phenotypic heterogeneity at the population level. Despite its commonness in nature, ecological memory and its potential influence on ecosystem dynamics have been so far overlooked in many applied contexts. Here, we use modeling to investigate how memory can influence the dynamics, composition, and stability landscape of communities. We incorporate long-term memory effects into a multi-species model recently introduced to investigate alternative stable states in microbial communities. We assess the impact of memory on key aspects of model behavior and further examine our findings using a model parameterized by empirical data from the human gut microbiota. Our approach for modeling long-term memory and studying its implications has the potential to improve our understanding of microbial community dynamics and ultimately our ability to predict, manipulate, and experimentally design microbial ecosystems. It could also be applied more broadly in the study of systems composed of interacting components.","2022",NA,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009396","WOS:000843626800003"
"Yan, XY; Levine, JM; Kandlikar, GS","A quantitative synthesis of soil microbial effects on plant species coexistence","PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA","Soil microorganisms play a major role in shaping plant diversity, not only through their direct effects as pathogens, mutualists, and decomposers, but also by altering the outcome of plant interactions. In particular, previous research has shown that the soil community often generates frequency-dependent feedback loops among plants that can either stabilize or destabilize species interactions and thereby promote or hinder species coexistence. However, recent insights from modern coexistence theory have shown that microbial effects on plant coexistence depend not only on these stabilizing or destabilizing effects, but also on the degree to which they generate competitive fitness differences. While many previous experiments have generated the data necessary for evaluating microbially mediated fitness differences, these effects have rarely been quantified in the literature. Here, we present a meta-analysis of data from 50 studies, which we used to quantify the microbially mediated (de)stabilization and fitness differences derived from a classic plant-soil feedback model. We found that across 518 plant species pairs, soil microbes generated both stabilization (or destabilization) and fitness differences, but also that the microbially mediated fitness differences dominated. As a consequence, if plants are otherwise equivalent competitors, the balance of soil microbe-generated (de)stabilization and fitness differences drives species exclusion much more frequently than coexistence or priority effects. Our work shows that microbially mediated fitness differences are an important but overlooked effect of soil microbes on plant coexistence. This finding paves the way for a more complete understanding of the processes that maintain plant biodiversity.","2022",NA,"10.1073/pnas.2122088119","WOS:001051443200006"
"Zhao, XF; Shu, WS; Hao, YQ","Seasonal Climate Variations Promote Bacterial α-Diversity in Soil","MICROBIAL ECOLOGY","Ecological theory suggests that temporal environmental fluctuations can contribute greatly to diversity maintenance. Given bacteria's short generation time and rapid responses to environmental change, seasonal climate fluctuations are very likely to play an important role in maintaining the extremely high alpha-diversity of soil bacterial community, which has been unfortunately neglected in previous studies. Here, with in-depth analyses of two previously published soil bacterial datasets at global scale, we found that soil bacterial alpha-diversity was positively correlated with both seasonal variations of temperature and precipitation. Furthermore, piecewise structural equation models showed that seasonal variations of temperature or precipitation had weak but significant positive effect on soil bacterial alpha-diversity in each dataset. However, it is noteworthy that the importance of seasonal climate variations might be underestimated in the above analyses, due to the potential confounding factors (such as vegetation type) and the lack of sampling across seasons. As a supplement, we analyzed a previously published wheat cropland dataset with samples collected in both winter and the following summer across North China Plain. As expected, bacterial alpha-diversity was positively correlated with seasonal climate variations in the cropland dataset, and climate seasonality explained a larger proportion of variations in bacterial alpha-diversity. Collectively, these findings implied that fluctuation-dependent mechanisms of diversity maintenance presumably operate in soil bacterial communities. Based on existing evidence, we speculated that the storage effect may be the main mechanism responsible for diversity maintenance in soil bacterial community, but rigorous experimental tests are needed in the future.","2022","MAY 2021","10.1007/s00248-021-01780-1","WOS:000656435000001"

Here, we investigate whether host anatomy can explain strain co-residence of Cutibacterium acnes, the most abundant species on human skin. We reconstruct on-person evolution and migration using whole-genome sequencing of C. acnes colonies acquired from healthy subjects, including from individual skin pores, and find considerable spatial structure at the level of pores. Although lineages (sets of colonies separated by <100 mutations) with in vitro fitness differences coexist within centimeter-scale regions, each pore is dominated by a single lineage. Moreover, colonies from a pore typically have identical genomes. An absence of adaptive signatures suggests a genotype-independent source of low within-pore diversity. We therefore propose that pore anatomy imposes random single-cell bottlenecks; the resulting population fragmentation reduces competition and promotes coexistence. Our findings suggest that therapeutic interventions involving pore-dwelling species might focus on removing resident populations over optimizing probiotic fitness.","2022","FEB 2022","10.1016/j.chom.2021.12.007","WOS:000768998600008"

To examine fitness based on colony size, we established a relationship between cell number and colony size for strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae robotically pinned onto solid agar plates in a high-density format. This was used to measure growth rates and estimate relative fitness differences between evolved strains and their ancestors. After controlling for edge effects through both normalization and agar-trimming, we found that colony size is a sensitive measure of fitness, capable of detecting 1% differences.

Environmental shifts that cause species loss or fluctuations in community composition are expected to become more common, so it is important to understand the evolutionary forces that shape the stability and function of the emergent community. Here we study experimental cultures of a simple, ecologically stable community of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Lactobacillus plantarum, in order to understand how the presence or absence of a species impacts coexistence over evolutionary timescales. We found that evolution in coculture led to drastically altered evolutionary outcomes for L. plantarum, but not S. cerevisiae. Both monoculture- and co-culture-evolved L. plantarum evolved dozens of mutations over 925 generations of evolution, but only L. plantarum that had evolved in isolation from S. cerevisiae lost the capacity to coexist with S. cerevisiae. We find that the evolutionary loss of ecological stability corresponds with fitness differences between monoculture-evolved L. plantarum and S. cerevisiae and genetic changes that repeatedly evolve across the replicate populations of L. plantarum. This work shows how coevolution within a community can prevent destabilising evolution in individual species, thereby preserving ecological diversity and stability, despite rapid adaptation.","2022","JAN 2022","10.1038/s41396-022-01191-1","WOS:000745567500001"

The formation of G4s was confirmed by biophysical methods on synthetic oligonucleotides derived from the predicted TBEV sequences. TBEV-5, located at the NS4b/NS5 boundary and conserved among all known flaviviruses, was tested along with its mutated variants for interactions with a panel of known G4 ligands, for the ability to affect RNA synthesis by the flaviviral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and for effects on TBEV replication fitness in cells. G4-stabilizing TBEV-5 mutations strongly inhibited RdRp RNA synthesis and exhibited substantially reduced replication fitness, different plaque morphology and increased sensitivity to G4-binding ligands in cell-based systems. In contrast, strongly destabilizing TBEV-5 G4 mutations caused rapid reversion to the wild-type genotype. Our results suggest that there is a threshold of stability for G4 sequences in the TBEV genome, with any deviation resulting in either dramatic changes in viral phenotype or a rapid return to this optimal level of G4 stability.

Epidemiological evidence suggests that this viral property has been under stabilising selection, with a typical optimum for the virus between 10(4) and 10(5) copies of viral RNA per ml. Here we aimed to detect transmission fitness differences between viruses from individuals with different SPVLs directly from phylogenetic trees inferred from whole-genome sequences. We used the local branching index (LBI) as a proxy for transmission fitness. We found that LBI is more sensitive to differences in infectiousness than to differences in the duration of the infectious state. By analysing subtype-B samples from the Bridging the Evolution and Epidemiology of HIV in Europe project, we inferred a significant positive relationship between SPVL and LBI up to approximately 10(5) copies/ml, with some evidence for a peak around this value of SPVL. This is evidence of selection against low values of SPVL in HIV-1 subtype-B strains, likely related to lower infectiousness, and perhaps a peak in the transmission fitness in the expected range of SPVL. The less prominent signatures of selection against higher SPVL could be explained by an inherent limit of the method or the deployment of antiretroviral therapy.","2022",NA,"10.1093/ve/veac022","WOS:000779782500001"

We further hypothesize that the variable plasticity in the considered traits of the here tested species may result in different niche differentiation with regard to a vertical light gradient. Ochromonas sp. should perform better in stable stratified surface water layers, where light is available, but prey abundances might be low. However, P. malhamensis should be able to also successfully grow in deeper water layers, benefiting from higher bacterial production.

For this purpose, nitrate, ammonium, and cyanamide were compared in greenhouse pot trials with the aim to suppress two important fungal wheat pathogens Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) and Gaeumannomyces graminis f. sp. tritici (Ggt). Wheat inoculated with the foliar pathogen Bgt was comparatively up to 80% less infested when fertilized with nitrate or cyanamide than with ammonium. Likewise, soil inoculation with the fungal pathogen Ggt revealed a 38% higher percentage of take-all infected roots in ammonium-fertilized plants. The bacterial rhizosphere microbiome was little affected by the N form, whereas the fungal community composition and structure were shaped by the different N fertilization, as revealed from metabarcoding data. Importantly, we observed a higher abundance of fungal pathogenic taxa in the ammonium-fertilized treatment compared to the other N treatments.

Our results showed that niche differentiation and potential interactions among those metabolically distinct nitrifiers were determined by their kinetic characteristics. The dominant species shifted from N. inopinata to N. communis in the N4 community (with all four types of nitrifiers) as ammonium concentrations increased, which could be well explained by the kinetic difference in ammonia affinity, specific growth rate, and substrate tolerance of nitrifiers in the SNCs.

Studies to date suggested a combination of deterministic (where biotic/abiotic factors act on fitness differences amongst taxa) and stochastic (where dispersal plays a larger factor in community assembly) processes are responsible for structuring biotic communities, but there is no consensus on the relative roles these processes play, and data is lacking for lakes. In the present study, we sampled different biotic components in 34 lakes located on the South Island of New Zealand. To obtain a holistic view of assembly processes in lakes we used metabarcoding to investigate bacteria in the sediment and surface waters, and eukaryotes in the sediment and two different size fractions of the water column. Physicochemical parameters were collected in parallel. Results showed that deterministic processes dominated the assembly of lake communities although the relative importance of variable and homogeneous selection differed among the biotic components. Variable selection was more important in the sediment (SSbact and SSeuks) and for the bacterioplankton (Pbact) while the assembly of the eukaryotic plankton (SPeuks, LPeuks) was driven more by homogeneous selection. The ease of human access to the lakes had a significant effect on lake communities. In particular, clade III of SAR11 and Daphnia pulex were only present in lakes with public access.

Accordingly, it is reasonable to predict that diverse AOA lineages would grow in ammonium (NH4+)-rich alkaline arable soils if AOB growth is suppressed. To test this hypothesis, a microcosm study was established using three different types of alkaline arable soils, in which a high NH4 concentration (200 mu g N g(-1) dry soil) was maintained by routinely replenishing urea and the activities of AOB were selectively inhibited by 1-octyne or 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP). Compared with amendment with urea alone, 1-octyne partially retarded AOB growth, while DMPP completely inhibited AOB. Both inhibitors accelerated the growth of AOA, with significantly higher ratios of abundance of AOA to AOB observed with DMPP amendment across soils. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS) indicated that different treatments significantly altered the community structures of both AOA and AOB and AOA OTUs enriched by high-NH4+ amendment were taxonomically constrained across the soils tested and closely related to Nitrososphaera viennensis EN76 and N. garnensis.

Insights into resource use and niche differentiation of functionally similar and/or taxonomically closely related species are scant, especially so for small organisms that dominate marine sediments in terms of abundance and species richness. In this study we characterized the microbiomes of 10 bacterivorous nematode species co-occurring in various estuarine microhabitats using 16S rRNA metabarcoding to address their resource utilization. We investigated microbiome diversity and composition of nematodes collected from six microhabitats in the field: Fucus spiralis, Fucus vesiculosus, fresh and decomposing thalli of Ulva sp., and attached and detached leaves of Spartina anglica. The 10 species belonged to three different families, and included congeneric and morphologically cryptic species. The microbiome of species sharing their microhabitats showed a substantial overlap, suggesting that resource differentiation of species within a microhabitat was rather limited at time of sampling. Microbiomes of the same nematode species found in different microhabitats were also not strongly differentiated. Temporal divergence in resource use may occur, as suggested by temporally divergent microbiome composition of nematodes associated with Ulva sp. The observed high intraspecific variability in microbiome composition of nematodes may be the principal factor explaining the lack of microbiome differentiation among species or microhabitats and may illustrate individual specialization in resource use as a consequence of substantial intraspecific competition.","2022",NA,"10.3389/fmars.2022.881566","WOS:000826759700001"

In this work, the vertical niche differentiation of CMX NB was investigated in the soils of 6 water-level fluctuation (WLF) zones (both natural and artificial) in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) region. The results demonstrated that the level of clade A amoA was obviously reduced with increasing soil depth in the natural WLF zones and one of the artificial WLF zones. However, in the other two artificial WLF zones, the abundance of this gene was not dramatically reduced with depth. The level of clade B amoA did not markedly decrease with increasing soil depth in most WLF zones and remained stable in the three WLF zones. Total nitrogen (TN) had the most significant effect on the abundance of CMX NB. Clade A.1, clade A.2.1, clade A.2.2, clade A.3, and clade B of CMX NB co-occurred simultaneously in all WLF zones. The number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of clade A in the two types of WLF zones first increased and then decreased with increasing depth, whereas the number of OTUs of clade B continuously increased with depth in the artificial WLF zone. Total carbon (TC) and pH, as environmental factors, affected the community structure of CMX NB. This study confirmed the vertical differentiation of the abundance and diversity of CMX NB in the WLF zones of the TGR region, and the artificial restoration of the WLF zones affected the niche differentiation of CMX NB to a certain degree.","2022",NA,"10.1186/s12302-022-00700-5","WOS:000898815000002"

This has practical significance since several filamentous genera are the main producers of the musty odorant 2-methylisoborneol (MIB), which lead to odor problems in drinking water. This study investigates the relationships between two filamentous cyanobacteria, the MIB-producing genus Planktothrix and the non-MIB-producing genus Pseudanabaena, in a drinking water reservoir. We firstly identified their niche characteristics based on a monitoring dataset, combined this information with culture experiments and developed a niche-based model to clarify these processes. The results reveal that the optimal light requirements of Pseudanabaena (1.56 mol m(-2) d(-1)) are lower than those of Planktothrix (3.67 mol m(-2) d(-1)); their light niche differentiation led to a fundamental replacement of Planktothrix (2013) by Pseudanabaena (2015) along with MIB decreases in this reservoir during 2013 and 2015.

Fungal pathogens infecting bell pepper plants may fluctuate across the growing seasons. Dynamic fluctuation of the microbiome and fungal pathogens in bell pepper plants is poorly understood, and the origin of fungal pathogens causing fruit rot and leaf wilt has been barely investigated. In this study, we used amplicon sequencing (i.e., 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer [ITS] sequencing) to explore the compositional variations of the microbiome in bell pepper plants and studied the fluctuation of fungal pathogens across the growing seasons. Co-occurrence network analysis was applied to track the origin and dissemination route of fungal pathogens that infected bell pepper plants. ITS and 16S rRNA sequencing analyses demonstrated that fungal pathogens infecting fruits and leaves probably belonged to the Penicillium, Cladosporium, Fusarium, and unclassified_Sclerotiniaceae genera rather than one specific genus. The dominant fungal pathogens were different, along with the development of bell pepper plants. Both plant development and fungal pathogens shaped microbial communities in bell pepper plants across the growing seasons. Fungal pathogens decreased species richness and diversity of fungal communities in fungus-infected fruit and leaf tissues but not the uninfected stem tissues. Bacterial metabolic functions of xenobiotics increased in fungus-infected leaves at a mature developmental stage. Competitive interaction was present between fungal and bacterial communities in leaves. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that the origins of fungal pathogens included the greenhouse, packing house, and storage room. Niche differentiation of microbes was discovered among these locations. IMPORTANCE Bell peppers are widely consumed worldwide. Fungal pathogen infections of bell peppers lead to enormous economic loss. To control fungal pathogens and increase economic benefit, it is essential to investigate the shifting patterns of the microbiome and fungal pathogens in bell pepper plants across the growing seasons. In this study, bell pepper plant diseases observed in fruits and leaves were caused by different fungal pathogens. Fungal pathogens originated from the greenhouse, packing house, and storage room, and niche differentiation existed among microbes.

The survival preference of DAMO microbes directly affects their habitat preference, enabling them playing different roles in different environments. There are few studies regarding the preference and adaptability of DAMO microbes in the environment. In this work, the survival characteristics of DAMO microbes in Taihu Lake were studied. The relative abundance of DAMO archaea was relatively high in samples D7 and D8 of the moderately eutrophic region. The abundance of DAMO bacteria was 1.82 x 10(4)-6.11 x 10(6) copies g(-1) sediment, which was the highest in D1 of the mildly eutrophic region. The microbial association network analysis showed a significant difference in the connector number between the Moderate-NA (54 connectors) and Mild-NA (27 connectors), and DAMO bacteria played the connector role in the Mild-NA. The OTU numbers showing a positive and negative correlation with DAMO bacteria were 7 and 8 in Mild-NA, respectively, while 7 and 10 in Moderate NA, showing a stronger competition relationship. For DAMO archaea, the corresponding OTUs in Mild-NA were 8 and 5, respectively, while 11 and 2 in Moderate-NA, showing a stronger cooperation association. DAMO microbes were differently affected by the antagonism of Rhodocyclaceae and Anammox bacteria.

Niche differentiation with respect to resources is a prominent hypothesis to account for the maintenance of species diversity in forest ecosystems. Resource-based niche differentiation has driven ecological specialization. Plants influence soil microbial diversity and distribution by affecting the soil environment. However, with the change in plant population type, whether the distribution of soil microbes is random or follows an ecologically specialized manner remains to be further studied. We characterized the soil microbiome (bacteria and fungi) in different plant populations to assess the effects of phytophysiognomy on the distribution patterns of soil microbial communities in a temperate forest in China. Results Our results showed that the distribution of most soil microbes in different types of plant populations is not random but specialized in these temperate forests. The distribution patterns of bacteria and fungi were related to the composition of plant communities. Fungal species (32%) showed higher specialization than bacterial species (15%) for different types of plant populations. Light was the main driving factor of the fungal community, and soil physicochemical factors were the main driving factor of the bacterial community. Conclusion These findings suggest that ecological specialization is important in maintaining local diversity in soil microbial communities in this forest. Fungi are more specialized than bacteria in the face of changes in plant population types. Changes in plant community composition could have important effects on soil microbial communities by potentially influencing the stability and stress resistance of forest ecosystems.","2022",NA,"10.1186/s12866-022-02591-1","WOS:000847695300002"

The first step of nitrification, ammonia oxidation, is performed by three, often co-occurring guilds of chemolithoautotrophs: ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), archaea (AOA), and complete ammonia oxidizers (comammox). Substrate kinetics are considered to be a major niche-differentiating factor between these guilds, but few AOA strains have been kinetically characterized. Here, the ammonia oxidation kinetic properties of 12 AOA representing all major cultivated phylogenetic lineages were determined using microrespirometry. Members of the genus Nitrosocosmicus have the lowest affinity for both ammonia and total ammonium of any characterized AOA, and these values are similar to previously determined ammonia and total ammonium affinities of AOB. This contrasts previous assumptions that all AOA possess much higher substrate affinities than their comammox or AOB counterparts. The substrate affinity of ammonia oxidizers correlated with their cell surface area to volume ratios. In addition, kinetic measurements across a range of pH values supports the hypothesis that-like for AOB-ammonia and not ammonium is the substrate for the ammonia monooxygenase enzyme of AOA and comammox. Together, these data will facilitate predictions and interpretation of ammonia oxidizer community structures and provide a robust basis for establishing testable hypotheses on competition between AOB, AOA, and comammox.","2022","JUL 2021","10.1038/s41396-021-01064-z","WOS:000677942400001"

Fertilization treatments included chemical nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) fertilizers (NPK), NP, NK, PK, and NPK plus peanut straw, rice straw, radish residue or pig manure. Our results revealed that comammox Nitrospira were undetectable in the NK, which was excluded from further analysis. Compared with NPK, NPK plus pig manure significantly increased the abundance of comammox Nitrospira clade A, while the other treatments did not. Available P was the most important factor positively associated with the abundance of clade A. In contrast, soil pH was the best predictor for the variation of comammox Nitrospira community structure, which was distinctly separated by three groups: PK, NPK plus pig manure and the other treatments. Four comammox Nitrospira clusters were identified: clades A.2.1, A.2.2, B.1, and B.2. Of these clusters, clade A.2.1 accounted for 100% of the comammox Nitrospira sequences in NPK, whereas PK and NPK plus pig manure increased the relative abundance of clades A.2.2, B.1, and B.2. The relative abundance of clade A.2.1 was negatively correlated to soil pH, while that of clade A.2.2 showed an opposite trend, indicating the potential niche differentiation of clade A in the soils.

However, marker genes are not linked to traits with complete fidelity, nor do they capture important attributes, such as the timing of gene expression or coordination among traits. To address this, we present an approach for assessing the trait landscape of microbial communities by statistically defining a trait attribute as a shared transcriptional pattern across multiple organisms. Leveraging the KEGG pathway database as a trait library and the Enhanced Biological Phosphorus Removal (EBPR) model microbial ecosystem, we demonstrate that a majority (65%) of traits present in 10 or more genomes have niche-differentiating expression attributes. For example, while many genomes containing high-affinity phosphorus transporter pstABCS display a canonical attribute (e.g. up-regulation under phosphorus starvation), we identified another attribute shared by many genomes where transcription was highest under high phosphorus conditions.

A high ammonium concentration was maintained during the incubation by regularly supplementing urea, and the growth of AOB was retarded to different extents using the AOB inhibitors 1-octyne (OC) and 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) as amendments. In parallel, a (CO2)-C-13-stable isotope probing (SIP) incubation study was conducted to investigate the metabolic activity of AOA and AOB under ammonium-rich conditions, with and without DMPP amendment. The results of the network-oriented microcosm incubation indicated that the growth of AOA was highly and negatively correlated with the growth of AOB (r =-0.94, P < 0.001). Network analysis of the whole prokaryotes showed that the majority of AOA phylotypes formed a module independent of AOB phylotypes, indicating their distinct niche preferences. In another distinctive module, we found the remaining AOA to have a coexclusion pattern with AOB, indicating a competitive relationship and a positive connection between AOB and many taxa capable of nitrite/nitrate metabolism, in particular denitrifi-cation. The SIP study confirmed that all AOA and AOB phylotypes retained in the network were autotrophically active. It was also shown that the phylotype susceptible to AOB competition was closely related to Nitrososphaera viennensis EN76.

Changes in amino acid propensities at protein sites over the course of evolution have been inferred from sequence alignments statistically, but the existing methods are data-intensive and aggregate multiple sites. Here, we develop an approach to detect individual amino acids that confer different fitness in different groups of species from combined sequence and phylogenetic data. Using the fact that the probability of a substitution to an amino acid depends on its fitness, our method looks for amino acids such that substitutions to them occur more frequently in one group of lineages than in another. We validate our method using simulated evolution of a protein site under different scenarios and show that it has high specificity for a wide range of assumptions regarding the underlying changes in selection, while its sensitivity differs between scenarios. We apply our method to the env gene of two HIV-1 subtypes, A and B, and to the HA gene of two influenza A subtypes, H1 and H3, and show that the inferred fitness changes are consistent with the fitness differences observed in deep mutational scanning experiments. We find that changes in relative fitness of different amino acid variants within a site do not always trigger episodes of positive selection and therefore may not result in an overall increase in the frequency of substitutions, but can still be detected from changes in relative frequencies of different substitutions. Author summaryWhich amino acids are acceptable at a certain protein site can change with time. In viruses, for example, this can be due to changes in mechanisms of drug resistance and immune escape in the course of evolution. Here, we develop a method for detecting such changes from how evolutionary events are distributed over an evolutionary tree. Informally, we infer that a certain amino acid is favored in a certain group of lineages if substitutions giving rise to it repeatedly occur in the evolution of this group, and disfavored if such substitutions are rare. In surface proteins of HIV-1 and influenza A, we find that changes in preferences detected with d-test match those observed in deep mutational scanning experiments. Our purely bioinformatic approach allows inference of changes in selection between lineages from sequences alone, shedding light on the functional differences between strains or species even in the absence of any structural or functional data.","2022",NA,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009878","WOS:000760839600004"

Segata et al. (2012) found that the microbiome of diverse habitats along the DT may be classified as four categories or niches with different microbial compositions and metabolic potentials. Nonetheless, few studies have offered theoretical interpretations of the observed patterns, not to mention quantitative mechanistic parameters. Such parameters should capture the essence of the fundamental processes that shape the microbiome distribution, beyond simple ecological metrics such as diversity or composition descriptors, which only capture the manifestations of the mechanisms. Here, we aim to get educated guesses for such parameters by adopting an integrated approach with multisite neutral (MSN) and niche-neutral hybrid (NNH) modeling, via reanalyzing Segata's 16s-rRNA samples covering 10 DT-sites from over 200 healthy individuals. We evaluate the relative importance of the four essential processes (drift, dispersal, speciation, and selection) in shaping the microbiome distribution and dynamics along DT, which are assumed to form a niche-neutral continuum. Furthermore, the continuum seems to be hierarchical: the selection or niche differentiations seem to play a predominant role (> 90% based on NNH) at the global (the DT metacommunity) level, but the neutral drifts seem to be prevalent (> 90% based on MSN/NNH) at the local sites except for the gut site. An additional finding is that the DT appears to have a fifth niche for the DT microbiome, namely, Keratinized gingival (KG), while in Segata's original study, only four niches were identified. Specifically, in Segata's study, KG was classified into the same niche type including buccal mucosa (BM), hard palate (HP), and KG. However, it should be emphasized that the proposal of the fifth niche of KG requires additional verification in the future studies.","2022",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2022.912240","WOS:000837289200001"

Despite their considerable spatial scale and impact on biogeochemical cycles, niche differentiation of abundant microbial clades is poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the microbial ecology of two bathy- (Brothers volcano; BrV-cone and northwest caldera; NWC) and a mesopelagic (Macauley volcano; McV) plumes on the Kermadec intra-oceanic arc in the South Pacific Ocean. The microbial community structure, determined by a combination of 16S rRNA gene, fluorescence in situ hybridization and metagenome analysis, was similar to the communities observed in other sulfur-rich plumes. This includes a dominance of the vent characteristic SUP05 clade (up to 22% in McV and 51% in BrV). In each of the three plumes analyzed, the community was dominated by a different yet uncultivated chemoautotrophic SUP05 species, here, provisionally named, Candidatus Thioglobus vadi (McV), Candidatus Thioglobus vulcanius (BrV-cone) and Candidatus Thioglobus plumae (BrV-NWC). Statistical analyses, genomic potential and mRNA expression profiles suggested a SUP05 niche partitioning based on sulfide and iron concentration as well as water depth. A fourth SUP05 species was present at low frequency throughout investigated plume samples and may be capable of heterotrophic or mixotrophic growth. Taken together, we propose that small variations in environmental parameters and depth drive SUP05 niche partitioning in hydrothermal plumes.","2022","JAN 2022","10.1038/s41396-022-01195-x","WOS:000750475100001"

Research on the abundance and niche differentiation of comammox in the sludges of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) would be useful for improving the nitrogen removal efficiency of WWTPs. Here, we investigated the relative abundance and diversity of comammox in fifteen sludges of five WWTPs that use the anaerobic-anoxic-aerobic process in Jinan, China, via quantitative polymerase chain reaction and high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and ammonia monooxygenase gene. In the activated sludges in the WWTPs, comammox clade A.1 was widely distributed and mostly comprised Candidatus Nitrospira nitrosa-like comammox (>98% of all comammox). The proportion of this clade was negatively correlated (p < 0.01) with the dissolved oxygen (DO) level (1.7-8 mg/L), and slight pH changes (7.20-7.70) affected the structure of the comammox populations. Nitrospira lineage I frequently coexisted with Nitrosomonas, which generally had a significant positive correlation (p < 0.05) with the DO level.

We found that the abundance, diversity and community composition of major N-cycling microbes differed dramatically between the two slope aspects, and these variances could be well explained by the aspect-driven differences in environmental conditions, especially soil temperature and moisture. The response patterns of different N-cycling groups to slope aspect were much inconsistent, especially for those with similar functions (i.e. ammonia-oxidizing archaea vs. bacteria, nirK- vs. nirS-reducers), indicating strong niche differentiation between these counterparts. We also observed strong preferences and distinct co-occurrence patterns of N-cycling microbial taxa for the two slope aspects.

Both ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) exhibited strong nitrification activities, although AOB performed most of the ammonia oxidation observed in the solonetz soil and in the farmland soil converted from solonetz soil. Members of the Nitrosococcus, which are more often associated with aquatic habitats, were identified as the dominant ammonia oxidizers in the solonetz soil with the first direct labeling evidence, while members of the Nitrosospira were the dominant ammonia oxidizers in the farmland soil, which had much lower salinity and pH. Metagenomic analysis of Candidatus Nitrosococcus sp. Sol14, a new species within the Nitrosococcus lineage, revealed multiple genomic adaptations predicted to facilitate osmotic and pH homeostasis in this extreme habitat, including direct Na+ extrusion/H+ import and the ability to increase intracellular osmotic pressure by accumulating compatible solutes. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that variation in salt-tolerance mechanisms was the primary driver for the niche differentiation of ammonia oxidizers in saline-sodic soils.

The genus Nitrospira is the most diverse among nitrifying microorganisms and of significant importance in nitrification in natural and engineered environments. These microorganisms are versatile, and niche differentiation has been observed even at the same lineage level. In general, bacteria of the genus Nitrospira can adapt to a wide range of conditions such as substrate concentrations, dissolved oxygen, and temperature. However, environmental and operating factors governing the presence and abundance of these organisms in different habitats are still not completely understood. Nitrite-oxidizing bacteria and complete ammonia oxidizers (comammox) of the genus Nitrospira are the nitrifying organisms frequently predominant in wastewater treatment plants. Nitrospira may also be associated with opportunities for wastewater treatment such as bioprocesses that consume less energy for aeration and produce a smaller volume of pollutant gases during nitrification. Nevertheless, the genus Nitrospira has not yet been completely characterized, and very few isolates have been obtained, making it difficult to investigate their unique metabolism for wastewater treatment. Therefore, to fill knowledge gaps and improve the understanding of the ecophysiology and importance of Nitrospira, it is crucial to develop an integrated strategy for the cultivation, identification, and characterization of these microorganisms. Thus, this review aims to identify some research gaps on Nitrospira and highlight the importance of this genus in the treatment of nitrogen-containing wastewater, as well as the interfering factors associated with niche differentiation and methods currently used to investigate these microorganisms.","2022","OCT 2022","10.1007/s11157-022-09634-z","WOS:000865207600001"

The lineage-specific biogeochemical roles of the widespread phylum Acidobacteria in hydrologically sensitive ecosystems, such as peatlands, are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Acidobacteria sublineages in Sphagnum peat respond differentially to redox fluctuations due to variable oxygen (O-2) availability, a typical feature of hydrologic variation. Our genome-centric approach disentangles the mechanisms of niche differentiation between the Acidobacteria genera Holophaga and Terracidiphilus in response to the transient O-2 exposure of peat in laboratory incubations. Interlineage functional diversification explains the enrichment of the otherwise rare Holophaga in anoxic peat after transient O-2 exposure in comparison to Terracidiphilus dominance in continuously anoxic peat. The observed niche differentiation of the two lineages is linked to differences in their carbon degradation potential. Holophaga appear to be primarily reliant on carbohydrate oligomers and amino acids, produced during the prior period of O-2 exposure via the O-2-stimulated breakdown of peat carbon, rich in complex aromatics and carbohydrate polymers. In contrast, Terracidiphilus genomes are enriched in diverse respiratory hydrogenases and carbohydrate active enzymes, enabling the degradation of complex plant polysaccharides into monomers and oligomers for fermentation. We also present the first evidence for the potential contribution of Acidobacteria in peat nitrogen fixation. In addition to canonical molybdenum-based diazotrophy, the Acidobacteria genomes harbor vanadium and iron-only alternative nitrogenases. Together, the results better inform the different functional roles of Acidobacteria in peat biogeochemistry under global change. IMPORTANCE Acidobacteria are among the most widespread and abundant members of the soil bacterial community, yet their ecophysiology remains largely underexplored. In acidic peat systems, Acidobacteria are thought to perform key biogeochemical functions, yet the mechanistic links between the phylogenetic and metabolic diversity within this phylum and peat carbon transformations remain unclear. Here, we employ genomic comparisons of Acidobacteria subgroups enriched in laboratory incubations of peat under variable O-2 availability to disentangle the lineage-specific functional roles of these microorganisms in peat carbon transformations. Our genome-centric approach reveals that the diversification of Acidobacteria subpopulations across transient O-2 exposure is linked to differences in their carbon substrate preferences. We also identify a previously unknown functional potential for biological nitrogen fixation in these organisms. This has important implications for carbon, nitrogen, and trace metal cycling in peat systems.","2022","AUG 2022","10.1128/msystems.00055-22","WOS:000849803600003"

Three ammonia-oxidizing functional guilds constitute the major producers of N2O in agricultural soils, but their relative contributions are still poorly understood, especially the newly discovered and widespread complete ammonia oxidizers (comammox). To fill this knowledge gap, we used three nitrification inhibitors: acetylene, 1octyne, and 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP), to selectively suppress the activity of different ammonia oxidizer guilds to discriminate their relative contributions to N2O production in an alkaline arable soil. The results indicated that DMPP completely inhibited the growth of comammox Nitrospira clade A and ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) but promoted ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) growth, while the abundance of comammox Nitrospira clade A increased in the presence of 1-octyne at high ammonium (NH4+) concentrations. AOB dominated N2O production in soils with inorganic NH4+ amendment, followed by AOA, while comammox Nitrospira contributed to less than 3% of total N2O emissions with an N2O yield of ~0.083% (N2O per molecule of nitrate). The abundance of comammox Nitrospira clade A was approximately two orders of magnitude lower than that of canonical ammonia-oxidizers. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the majority of comammox Nitrospira clade A belonged to a new cluster that was separated from the known comammox bacterium. Taken together, our results clearly and strongly demonstrate that comammox Nitrospira play only a minor role in N2O emissions in a heavily fertilized alkaline arable soil.","2022","MAY 2022","10.1016/j.soilbio.2022.108720","WOS:000808182500009"

Stone biodeterioration involves a complex ecological interplay among organisms, however, the ecological mechanisms (deterministic or stochastic processes) that determine the microbial community on stone remain poorly understood. Here, using both amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing approaches, we comprehensively investigated the biodiversity, assembly, and function of communities (including prokaryotes, fungi, microfauna, and plants) on various types of deteriorating limestone across different habitats in Feilaifeng. By generalizing classic ecological models to stone habitats, we further uncovered and quantified the mechanisms underlying microbial community assembly processes and microbial interactions within the biodeteriorated limestone. Community profiling revealed stable ecosystem functional potential despite high taxonomic variation across different biodeterioration types, suggesting non-random community assembly. Increased niche differentiation occurred in prokaryotes and fungi but not in microfauna and plant during biodeterioration. Certain microbial groups such as nitrifying archaea and bacteria showed wider niche breadth and likely contributing to the initiation, succession and expansion of stone biodeterioration. Consistently, prokaryotes were more strongly structured by selection-based deterministic processes, while micro-eukaryotes were more influenced by dispersal and drift-based stochastic processes. Importantly, microbial coexistence maintains network robustness within stone microbiotas, highlighting mutual cooperation among functional microorganisms. These results provide new insights into microbial community assembly mechanisms in stone ecosystems and may aid in the sustainable conservation of stone materials of interest. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Climate did not affect the distribution of the hyperparasite at the continental scale and at the national scale in Sweden. However, climate affected the hyperparasite distribution in France, with a negative relationship between non-growing season temperature and presence of the hyperparasite.

Soil ecologists often operate with functional groups to infer the effects of individual taxa on ecosystem functions and services. Simultaneous assessment of the functional roles of multiple taxa is possible using food-web reconstructions, but our knowledge of the feeding habits of many taxa is insufficient and often based on limited evidence. Over the last two decades, molecular, biochemical and isotopic tools have improved our understanding of the feeding habits of various soil organisms, yet this knowledge is still to be synthesised into a common functional framework. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the feeding habits of consumers in soil, including protists, micro-, meso- and macrofauna (invertebrates), and soil-associated vertebrates. We have integrated existing functional group classifications with findings gained with novel methods and compiled an overarching classification across taxa focusing on key universal traits such as food resource preferences, body masses, microhabitat specialisation, protection and hunting mechanisms. Our summary highlights various strands of evidence that many functional groups commonly used in soil ecology and food-web models are feeding on multiple types of food resources. In many cases, omnivory is observed down to the species level of taxonomic resolution, challenging realism of traditional soil food-web models based on distinct resource-based energy channels. Novel methods, such as stable isotope, fatty acid and DNA gut content analyses, have revealed previously hidden facets of trophic relationships of soil consumers, such as food assimilation, multichannel feeding across trophic levels, hidden trophic niche differentiation and the importance of alternative food/prey, as well as energy transfers across ecosystem compartments. Wider adoption of such tools and the development of open interoperable platforms that assemble morphological, ecological and trophic data as traits of soil taxa will enable the refinement and expansion of the multifunctional classification of consumers in soil. The compiled multifunctional classification of soil-associated consumers will serve as a reference for ecologists working with biodiversity changes and biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, making soil food-web research more accessible and reproducible.","2022","JAN 2022","10.1111/brv.12832","WOS:000744680200001"
"Yamamichi, M; Letten, AD","Extending the gleaner-opportunist trade-off","JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY","Species exhibit various trade-offs that can result in stable coexistence of competitors. The gleaner-opportunist trade-off to fluctuations in resource abundance is one of the most intuitive, yet also misunderstood, coexistence-promoting trade-offs. Here, we review its history as an ecological concept, discuss extensions to the classical theory and outline opportunities to advance its understanding. The mechanism of coexistence between species that grow relatively faster than their competitors in a low-resource environment (i.e. a gleaner) versus a high-resource environment (i.e. an opportunist) was first proposed in the 1970s. Stable coexistence could emerge between gleaners and opportunists if the opportunist species (dominant in unstable environments) dampens resource fluctuations via relatively convex functional responses, while the gleaner species (dominant in stable environments) promotes fluctuations, or diminishes them less than the opportunist does, via relatively saturating functional responses. This fluctuation-dependent coexistence mechanism has since been referred to by various names, including the Armstrong-McGehee mechanism and relative nonlinearity of competition. Several researchers have argued this mechanism likely plays a relatively minor role in species coexistence owing in part to the restricted range of conditions that allow it to operate. More recent theoretical research, however, suggests that relative nonlinearity can operate over wider conditions than previously thought. Here, we identify several novel, or little explored, extensions to the gleaner-opportunist trade-off that can yield species coexistence under phenomena as diverse as fluctuations in predation/pathogen pressure, multiple resources, phenotypic plasticity and rapid evolution, amongst other phenomena. While the original definition of the gleaner-opportunist trade-off may be imperfect as a collective for these extensions, we argue that a subtle reframing of the trade-off focusing on species' performance in equilibrium versus fluctuating conditions (irrespective of preferences for high or low resources, predation pressure or other competitive factors) reveals their fundamental commonality in stable coexistence via relative nonlinearity. An extended framing shines a light on the potential ubiquity of this canonical trade-off in nature and on the breadth of theoretical and empirical terrain that remains to be trodden.","2022","OCT 2022","10.1111/1365-2656.13813","WOS:000871246900001"

Through experiments in gnotobiotic mice with complex microbiomes, we demonstrated that strains of Akkermansia muciniphila and Bacteroides vulgatus could only be established if microbiomes were devoid of these species. Strains of A. muciniphila showed strict competitive exclusion, while B. vulgatus strains coexisted but populations were still influenced by competitive interactions. These differences in competitive behavior were reflective of genomic variation within the two species, indicating considerable niche overlap for A. muciniphila strains and a broader niche space for B. vulgatus strains. Priority effects were detected for both species as strains' competitive fitness increased when colonizing first, which resulted in stable persistence of the A. muciniphila strain colonizing first and competitive exclusion of the strain arriving second. Based on these observations, we devised a subtractive strategy for A. muciniphila using antibiotics and showed that a strain from an assembled community can be stably replaced by another strain. By demonstrating that competitive outcomes in gut ecosystems depend on niche differences and are historically contingent, our study provides novel information to explain the ecological characteristics of gut microbiomes and a basis for their modulation.","2022","FEB 2022","10.1038/s41396-022-01208-9","WOS:000761880400001"

In this study, we synthesized the seasonal patterns in soil microbial biomass and their associations with plant gross primary productivity (GPP) with 335 seasonal cases from nine types of biomes in the world (133 publi-cations). We found that seasonal dynamics in microbial biomass changed with biome types. Microbial biomass peaked in winter in tundra, dry season in savanna and tropical monsoon forest, spring in Mediterranean, autumn in temperate forest, and summer in subtropical forest. Negative relationships between monthly microbial biomass and GPP were detected in tundra, tropical monsoon forest, savanna, and desert, suggesting seasonal asynchrony between plants and microorganisms. This asynchronous pattern was advanced by low temperature and dry climate. In addition, seasonal microbial biomass and GPP were decoupled in temperate forest, sub-tropical forest, tropical rain forest, and grassland.

While differing by only 1.3% at the 16S rRNA gene level, members of the intertidal benthic ecotypes are complete denitrifiers whereas the pelagic ecotype representative (DSS-3) is a partial denitrifier lacking a nitrate reductase. The intertidal benthic ecotypes are further differentiated by using non-homologous nitrate reductases and a different set of genes that allow alleviating oxidative stress and acquiring organic substrates. In the presence of nitrate, the two ecotypes showed contrasting growth patterns under initial oxygen concentrations at 1 vol% versus 7 vol% and supplemented with different carbon sources abundant in intertidal sediments. Collectively, this combination of evidence indicates that there are cryptic niches in coastal intertidal sediments that support divergent evolution of denitrifying bacteria.

Two paddy soils collected in January (winter, nitrification almost stopped) and June (summer, nitrification occurred quickly and at high rates) in 2021 were analyzed for nitrification rates. In situ active nitrifiers were identified by quantifying the amoA gene and transcript abundance to distinguish the relative importance of Ammonia Oxidizing Archaea (AOA), Ammonia Oxidizing Bacteria (AOB) and commomox Nitrospira Clade A and Clade B to ammonia oxidation. Both amoA gene abundance and transcript abundance for comammox were high even in January when nitrification almost stopped and did not increase significantly in summer when nitrification occurred at high rates. On the contrary, AOB transcriptional activity showed a consistent pattern with nitrification, with the amoA gene expression being low for AOB in winter when nitrification almost stopped and increased two orders of magnitudes in summer when nitrification occurred quickly. AOB showed a much higher transcription ratio than AOA. These results indicated that AOB basically drives ammonia oxidation in these paddy soils, and comammox Nitrospira adapts better to low temperature conditions than AOA and AOB. Furthermore, soil water content was identified to be an important factor in shaping comammox clade A activity, but not clade B in these two neutral paddy soils.","2022","MAR 2022","10.1016/j.soilbio.2022.108641","WOS:000793242400005"

Composition of bacterial and fungal communities exhibited distinct patterns of ecological succession measured through time and by bedding depth. Community composition patterns were related to management practices and choice of bedding material. Aspergillus and Penicillium species exhibited niche differentiation expressed as differential substrate requirements; however, they generally exhibited traits of early colonizers of bedding substrates, typically rich in carbon and low in nitrogen.

Recent work shows that trophic niche partitioning between parrotfishes (Labridae: Scarini) is more extensive than previously described. One Indo-Pacific species, Scarus spinus, appears highly specialized, scraping crustose coralline algae (CCA) with powerful oral jaws. CCA are of low nutritional value, suggesting that the dietary targets of this parrotfish are protein-rich microphotoautotrophs associated with CCA, particularly filamentous cyanobacteria. We collected feeding substrata samples at mid-shelf and outer-shelf sites near Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia, in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Scarus spinus were followed on snorkel. When biting was observed, bite substrata were photographed and then a 22-mm-diameter core extracted around the bite site. Density of biota including filamentous cyanobacteria and diatoms was quantified microscopically on photographs of the bite cores (up to 630 x magnification). The taxonomy of cyanobacteria and CCA was refined using next-generation sequencing of 16S and 18S rRNA genes, respectively. CCA and filamentous cyanobacteria were present on all bite cores and the density of filamentous cyanobacteria where S. spinus fed did not vary between mid-shelf and outer-reef samples. Epiphytic and shallow endophytic cyanobacteria were consistently associated with the CCA where S. spinus fed, including Calothrix spp., Mastigocoleus testarum, Leptolyngbya spp., Hyella patelloides and Oscillatoriales. Our results emphasize the importance of high-resolution species-specific dietary data for parrotfishes.

We designed a disturbance experiment where PNA biofilms, treating water from a high-rate activated sludge process, were constantly or intermittently exposed to anaerobic sidestream wastewater, which has been proposed to inhibit nitrite oxidizers. With increasing sidestream exposure we observed decreased abundance, alpha-diversity, functional versatility, and hence functional redundancy, among Nitrospira in the PNA biofilms, while the opposite patterns were observed for anammox bacteria within Brocadia. At the same time, species turnover was observed for aerobic ammonia-oxidizing Nitrosomonas populations. The different exposure regimens were associated with metagenomic assembled genomes of Nitrosomonas, Nitrospira, and Brocadia, encoding genes related to N-cycling, substrate usage, and osmotic stress response, possibly explaining the three different patterns by niche differentiation.

Moreover, salinity was the best predictor of RFGs' biomass (higher R-2), followed by depth, soluble reactive phosphorus, irradiance, water transparency, and dissolved inorganic nitrogen. Our approach improves the understanding of how RFGs interact with environmental gradients in tropical reservoirs, helping water managers to adopt sustainable practices to control algal blooms, based on predictions of the future state of dominance.","2022","NOV 2021","10.1007/s10750-021-04750-3","WOS:000722097200001"

How selection works on different parts of bacterial pan-genomes to drive and maintain the emergence of clades is unclear. Focusing on the three largest clades in the diverse and well-studied Bacillus cereus sensu lato group, we identified clade-specific core genes (present in all clade members) and then used clade-specific allelic diversity to identify genes under purifying and diversifying selection. Clade-specific accessory genes (present in a subset of strains within a clade) were characterized as being under selection using presence/absence in specific clades. Gene ontology analyses of genes under selection revealed that different gene functions were enriched in different clades. Furthermore, some gene functions were enriched only amongst clade-specific core or accessory genomes. Genes under purifying selection were often clade-specific, while genes under diversifying selection showed signs of frequent HGT. These patterns are consistent with different selection pressures acting on both the core and the accessory genomes of different clades and can lead to ecological divergence in both cases. Examining variation in allelic diversity allows us to uncover genes under clade-specific selection, allowing ready identification of strains and their ecological niche.","2022","MAY 2022","10.1111/mec.16490","WOS:000796365600001"

Quantification of the strength, density, and nature of foraging behaviors enables the investigation of how these may have changed through time. Here, we present a novel approach to explore such patterns using spatial point process analyses to quantify the scale and strength of ichnofossil spatial distributions on horizontal bedding planes. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we use two samples from the terminal Ediacaran Shibantan Member in South China (between 551 and 543 Ma) and the early Cambrian Nagaur Sandstone in northwestern India (between 539 and 509 Ma). We find that ichnotaxa on both surfaces exhibited significant nonhomogeneous lateral patterns, with distinct levels of heterogeneity exhibited by different types of trace fossils. In the Shibantan, two ichnotaxa show evidence for mutual positive aggregation over a shared resource, suggesting the ability to focus on optimal resource areas. Trace fossils from the Nagaur Sandstone exhibit more sophisticated foraging behavior, with greater niche differentiation. Critically, mark correlation functions highlight significant spatial autocorrelation of trace fossil orientations, demonstrating the greater ability of these Cambrian tracemakers to focus on optimal patches. Despite potential limitations, these analyses hint at changes in the development and optimization of foraging at the Ediacaran/Cambrian transition and highlight the potential of spatial point process analysis to tease apart subtle differences in behavior in the trace fossil record.","2022","MAY 2022","10.1017/pab.2022.16","WOS:000797718400001"

A comparative study on microbiota of the rhizosphere and endosphere of Populus deltoides and their structural and functional variations in response to composite HMs pollution was conducted. Results suggested that habitat niche was the driving force in shaping bacterial composition as shown by distinctive niche differentiation of 48 core species. Among all factors, HM explained 43% of the bacterial variability that constituted the key determinant for all microbiota structures. Further redundancy analysis revealed Cd and Pb were the main drivers of soil microbiota distribution, while none of HMs significantly affected the structure of endophytes. The responses of microbiota to HM stress varied in different habitats. The diversity (Shannon) and richness (Chao) of bare soil (CS) was significantly deteriorated by HM, but richness of rhizosphere (CRS) was greatly increased than CS, indicating the beneficial effects of phytoremediation to bacterial composition. Functional genes were also enriched in contaminated samples related to multiple cell defence mechanisms including extracellular binding, transmembrane transport, and antioxidant protection. Metabolic pathways related to plant signaling compounds and energy-rich nucleotides were enriched in endophytes, inferring the potential for stress protection and plant growth promotion. This study indicated that shifts of microbial organization and function strengthened their HM stress adaptability; plant associated microbiome contributed to the phytoremediation efficiency, which could provide the basis for soil evaluation after phytoremediation and further exploration of host-microbe interactions in mine ecosystems.","2022","DEC 2021","10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.104359","WOS:000734887700005"

However, despite being a classic example of an obligate symbiosis, tests of cophylogeny between scleractinian corals and their photosynthetic algal symbionts have been hampered in the past because both corals and algae contain genetically unresolved and morphologically cryptic species. Here, we studied co-occurring, cryptic Pocillopora species from Mo ' orea, French Polynesia, that differ in their relative abundance across depth. We constructed new phylogenies of the host Pocillopora (using complete mitochondrial genomes, genomic loci, and thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms) and their Symbiodiniaceae symbionts (using ITS2 and psbA(ncr) markers) and tested for cophylogeny. The analysis supported the presence of five Pocillopora species on the fore reef at Mo ' orea that mostly hosted either Cladocopium latusorum or C. pacificum. Only Pocillopora species hosting C. latusorum also hosted taxa from Symbiodinium and Durusdinium. In general, the Cladocopium phylogeny mirrored the Pocillopora phylogeny. Within Cladocopium species, lineages also differed in their associations with Pocillopora haplotypes, except those showing evidence of nuclear introgression, and with depth in the two most common Pocillopora species. We also found evidence for a new Pocillopora species (haplotype 10), that has so far only been sampled from French Polynesia, that warrants formal identification. The linked phylogenies of these Pocillopora and Cladocopium species and lineages suggest that symbiont speciation is driven by niche diversification in the host, but there is still evidence for symbiont flexibility in some cases.","2022","AUG 2022","10.1111/mec.16654","WOS:000847226400001"

However, despite the obvious role that biota play in the global carbon cycle, the effects of biotic interactions on carbon pools and fluxes are poorly understood. Here we develop a conceptual framework that illustrates the importance of biotic interactions in regulating carbon cycling based on a literature review and a quantitative synthesis by means of meta-analysis. Our study focuses on blue carbon ecosystems-vegetated coastal ecosystems that function as the most effective long-term CO2 sinks of the biosphere. We demonstrate that a multitude of mutualistic, competitive and consumer-resource interactions between plants, animals and microbiota exert strong effects on carbon cycling across various spatial scales ranging from the rhizosphere to the landscape scale. Climate change-sensitive abiotic factors modulate the strength of biotic-interaction effects on carbon fluxes, suggesting that the importance of biota-mediated carbon cycling will change under future climatic conditions. Strong effects of biotic interactions on carbon cycling imply that biosphere-climate feedbacks may not be sufficiently represented in current Earth system models. Inclusion of new functional groups in these models, and new approaches to simplify species interactions, may thus improve the predictions of biotic effects on the global climate.","2022","JAN 2022","10.1111/ele.13940","WOS:000740763000001"

Here we studied microbial plankton (bacteria, archaea, protists and micro-metazoans) in a large temperate estuary where bottom hypoxia occurs every summer due to warmer temperatures, stratification, and oxidation of organic matter fueled by nutrient enrichment. We used high-throughput sequencing of the 16S and 18S rRNA genes (V4 region) and quantified multiple abiotic and biotic factors in surface and bottom waters during the summer of 2019. The conditions associated with the intensification of hypoxia in bottom waters as the summer progressed were linked to significant changes in the diversity, community structure and potential functioning of microbial communities. Under maximum hypoxia (dissolved oxygen concentration: 0.9-3.1 mg 1(-1)), there were increased proportions of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), bacterivorous and parasitic protists, and copepod nauplii. Sequence proportions of AOA (Nitrosopumilus) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (Nitrospinaceae) were significantly correlated with the concentration of oxidized N species (nitrite plus nitrate, which peaked at 14.4 mu M) and the proportions of nauplii DNA sequences and biomass. Our data support a tight coupling of biogeochemical and food web processes, with rapid oxidation of ammonia and accumulation of oxidized N species as hypoxia intensifies during the summer.","2022",NA,"10.3354/ame01982","WOS:000790576000006"

Amplicon sequence variants (ASV) were obtained from the water, tank biofilm, and biofilters of two systems, pre-ongrowing and weaning, and the study focuses on two microbial target groups, the potentially pathogenic and the nitrifying prokaryotes. No significant negative correlations were found with any target ASVs, indicating a mostly cooperative environment. As expected, ammonia oxidizing bacteria (Nitrosomonas) and archaea (Candidatus Nitrosopumilus) were found to be positively interacting with the nitrite oxidizing bacteria Nitrospira. However, no interactions were found between them, and results hint at a niche differentiation based on ammonia competition. Nitrospira also showed subcommunities with no ammonia oxidizing archaea or ammonia oxidizing bacteria correlations, hinting at a separate functional role of complete ammonia oxidation to nitrate for some Nitrospira ASVs. Two taxa commonly associated with pathogenic outbreaks, Tenacibaculum and Vibrio, had a significant positive correlation in one of the systems.

In this study, three ML models (extreme learning machine (ELM), artificial neural network (ANN), and random forest (RF)) were applied to analyse and model AD of dry fermentation. The results showed that the best prediction model, based on ELM, could best predict the material biogas production in this experiment with a mean absolute error (MAE/10) of 0.678 and a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.9574, whereas the characteristic percentage analysis of the RF model showed that butyric acid, acetic acid, and pH had three important influences on the biogas production values. Meanwhile, the results of high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing and PICRUSt showed that the addition of manure containing ammonia nitrogen improved the metabolism of amino acids, enriched species capable of Clostridiales and Methanosarcinales, promoted the electronic transfer of nutrient metabolism, and thus enhanced AD. Moreover, the co-occurrence network showed that seven niches were differentiated within the HS -AD system to reduce the shock of ammonia nitrogen for methanogens.

We show that phytoplankton species richness in an unbalanced nutrient supply context was influenced by wind-driven processes, ecological specialization for dissolved inorganic phosphorous, temporal niche differentiation, and a competition-defense and/or a growth-defense trade-off, a coexistence mechanism where weak competitors (i.e., slower growing) are better protected against predation. Under the influence of both environmental perturbations (e.g., wind-driven processes, freshwater influence, unbalanced nutrient levels) and biotic interactions (e.g., competition, predation, facilitation), phytoplankton species exhibited specific survival strategies such as investment on growth, adaptation and tolerance of species to environmental stresses, silicification and resource specialization. These strategies have led to more speciose communities, higher productivity, functional redundancy and stability in the last decade. Our results revealed that the unbalanced nutrient reduction facilitated Phaeocystis blooms and that anthropogenic climate warming and nitrate reduction may threaten the diatom communities of the eastern English Channel in a near future. Our results provide strong support for biogeographical historical and niche-based processes in structuring the phytoplankton community in this temperate region.

However, the inhibitory effect of SA on nitrification and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in different soils and the environmental factors controlling the degree of inhibition have not been studied. Using 14-day microcosm incubation, we investigated the effects of different concentrations of SA on nitrification activity, abundance of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms, and N2O emissions in three typical agricultural soils. The nitrification inhibitory efficacy of SA was strongest in acidic red soil, followed by weakly acidic paddy soil, with no significant effect in an alkaline calcareous soil. Potential nitrification activity (PNA) were also greatly reduced by SA additions in paddy and red soil. Pearson correlation analysis showed that the inhibitory efficacy of SA might be negatively correlated with soil pH and positively correlated with clay percentage.

Perturbed development of the respiratory microbial community in early-life has been associated with higher susceptibility to respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Given a consistent gap in time between first signs of aberrant microbial maturation and the observation of the first RTIs, we hypothesized that early-life host-microbe cross-talk plays a role in this process. We therefore investigated viral presence, gene expression profiles and nasopharyngeal microbiota from birth until 12 months of age in 114 healthy infants. We show that the strongest dynamics in gene expression profiles occurred within the first days of life, mostly involving Toll-like receptor (TLR) and inflammasome signalling. These gene expression dynamics coincided with rapid microbial niche differentiation. Early asymptomatic viral infection co-occurred with stronger interferon activity, which was related to specific microbiota dynamics following, including early enrichment of Moraxella and Haemophilus spp. These microbial trajectories were in turn related to a higher number of subsequent (viral) RTIs over the first year of life. Using a multi-omic approach, we found evidence for species-specific host-microbe interactions related to consecutive susceptibility to RTIs. Although further work will be needed to confirm causality of our findings, together these data indicate that early-life viral encounters could impact subsequent host-microbe cross-talk, which is linked to later-life infections.

However, it remains unclear how plant-microbial competition for N changes after the restoration of degraded alpine grasslands. This study aimed to explore the dynamics of plant-microbial competition for N in restoration chronosequences (i.e., short-, medium-, and long-term) in an alpine meadow and an alpine steppe on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Two inorganic forms of N (ammonium (NH4+ ) and nitrate (NO3-)) and one organic N (glycine) were used for the in situ N-15 labeling experiments. The competition between microorganisms and plants (i.e., ratios) for N increased by 4.8 times after medium- than short-term restoration in the alpine meadow and remained stable after each restoration. Compared to short-term restoration, medium-term restoration increased the N uptake of microorganisms by 2.4 times in alpine meadow and 4.3 times in alpine steppe. Microorganisms and plants showed chemical niche differentiation between NH4+ and NO3- uptake in both alpine ecosystems after medium-term restoration, with microorganisms taking up more NH4+ but plants taking up more NO3-. Competition between microorganisms and plants decreased after long-term compared with medium-term restoration, maintaining the microbial to plant N uptake ratio > 1. Long-term restoration increased plant N uptake in the alpine meadow, while decreased the microbial N uptake in the alpine steppe. Neither microorganisms nor plants showed a preference for glycine, but glycine uptake by microorganisms was higher than plants after medium- and long-term restorations. These findings provide valuable insights into the restoration of degraded alpine grasslands from the perspective of plant-microbial competition for available N in soil, which may be useful for developing sustainable grassland management practices.","2022","SEP 2022","10.1007/s00374-022-01660-x","WOS:000849472800002"

However, the development of dinoflagellate blooms and their effects on the plankton community are still not well explored. Here we relate the species succession of MTD with parallel changes of phytoplankton size spectra during periods of MTD dominance. We used FlowCAM analysis to acquire size spectra in the range 2-200 mu m every one or two weeks from July to December 2007 at Helgoland Roads (Southern North Sea). Most size spectra of dinoflagellates were bimodal, whereas for other groups, e.g. diatoms and autotrophic flagellates, the spectra were unimodal, which indicates different resource use strategies of autotrophs and mixotrophs. The biomass lost in the size spectrum correlates with the potential grazing pressure of MTD. Based on size-based analysis of trophic linkages, we suggest that mixotrophy, including detritivory, drives species succession and facilitates the formation of bimodal size spectra. Bimodality in particular indicates niche differentiation through grazing of large MTD on smaller MTD. Phagotrophy of larger MTD may exceed one of the smaller MTD since larger prey was more abundant than smaller prey. Under strong light limitation, a usually overlooked refuge strategy may derive from detritivory. The critical role of trophic links of MTD as a central component of the plankton community may guide future observational and theoretical research.","2022","MAR 2022","10.1093/plankt/fbac013","WOS:000806618400001"

Here, we ask how this plant-human mutualism has, in turn, impacted beneficial interactions within crop species, between crop species, and between crops and their associated microbial partners. We focus on beneficial interactions resulting from three main mechanisms that can be promoted by manipulating genetic diversity in agrosystems: niche partitioning, facilitation, and kin selection. We show that a combination of factors has impacted either directly or indirectly plant-plant interactions during domestication and breeding, with a trend toward reduced benefits arising from niche partitioning and facilitation. Such factors include marked decrease of molecular and functional diversity of crops and other organisms present in the agroecosystem, mass selection, and increased use of chemical inputs. For example, the latter has likely contributed to the relaxation of selection pressures on nutrient-mobilizing traits such as those associated to root exudation and plant nutrient exchanges via microbial partners. In contrast, we show that beneficial interactions arising from kin selection have likely been promoted since the advent of modern breeding. We highlight several issues that need further investigation such as whether crop phenotypic plasticity has evolved and could trigger beneficial interactions in crops, and whether human-mediated selection has impacted cooperation via kin recognition. Finally, we discuss how plant breeding and agricultural practices can help promoting beneficial interactions within and between species in the context of agroecology where the mobilization of diversity and complexity of crop interactions is viewed as a keystone of agroecosystem sustainability.","2022","MAY 2022","10.1111/eva.13390","WOS:000797476200001"

Characterizing the impact of this large-scale ecosystem conversion on the composition and activity of the soil microbial community is crucial for understanding potentially consequential shifts in nutrient and greenhouse gas cycling, as well as adding to the body of knowledge concerning how tropical ecosystems respond to human disturbance. Research to date has shown that locally, communities of soil microorganisms tend to become more diverse upon conversion of forest to pasture. However, these communities undergo taxonomic homogenization at landscape-level spatial scales, mirroring the homogenization of plant communities across pastures. Microbial community structure is distinct between forest and pasture soil communities across several studies, and specific taxa, such as Firmicutes and Acidobacteria, show consistent association with pasture and forest soils, respectively. In addition, shifts in microbial community functions with pasture conversion have relevant impacts on both carbon and nitrogen cycling at the ecosystem scale: the abundance and diversity of methane-cycling prokaryotes shifts in conjunction with increased methane flux in pastures. Further, quantitation and community profiling of free-living nitrogen fixers has demonstrated that this functional group is favored in pastures and suggests that asymbiotic N-2 fixation may be a significantly augmented process. While human-driven deforestation is continuing, a large percentage of once-converted pastures are undergoing the process of secondary forest succession. Assessment of microbial communities in secondary forests compared to primary forests and pastures suggests convergence toward a recovery of functionality and community composition with reforestation.","2022",NA,"10.1016/bs.agron.2022.04.001","WOS:000893346800004"

We investigated how abundance and diversity of soil fungi and invertebrates responded to a reduction in fresh below-ground photosynthate supply in treeline birch and willow, achieved using stem girdling. We hypothesised that birch forest would support greater abundance of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal species and fauna than willow shrubs, and that girdling would result in a rapid switch from ECM fungi to saprotrophs as canopy supply of C was cut, with a concomitant decline in soil fauna. Birch forest had greater fungal and faunal abundance with a large contribution of root-associated ascomycetes (ericoid mycorrhizal fungi and root endophytes) compared to willow shrub plots, which had a higher proportion of saprotrophs and, contrary to our expectations, ECM fungi. Broad-scale soil fungal and faunal functional group composition was not significantly changed by girdling, even in the third year of treatment. Within the ECM community, there were some changes, with genera that are believed to be particularly C-demanding declining in girdled plots.

In this study we investigate how Aedes albopictus, an invasive mosquito of considerable public health concern fits within mosquito communities at the edge of its range of distribution. This was addressed using a 2-year field survey of mosquitoes in south-eastern Illinois. We found that Ae. albopictus was more broadly distributed in this region than previously realized, with new occurrence records for nine counties. Abundance of this species varied strongly and peaked in locations of low-intermediate overall mosquito species richness. This differed from overall mosquito abundance, as well as abundance of another important vector, Cx. pipiens, for which the abundance-richness relationships were best described with power functions. Metacommunity analyses revealed that mosquito communities showed a non-random distribution with a Clementsian gradient, which suggests a pattern whereby distinct species assemblages are associated with specific habitats or environmental conditions. Land use was a significant underlying factor shaping mosquito community structure and species assemblages. Multivariate analyses showed that while Ae. canadensis and Cx. pipiens complex mosquitoes were associated with high and low proportions of wetlands in the environment, respectively, Ae. albopictus was most strongly associated with urban settlements. This work sheds light on landscape-level processes, such as niche differentiation driven by urban and agricultural development, structuring mosquito communities. We suggest that mosquito community assessments across habitats be incorporated as part of a One Health vector surveillance approach to aid in the goal of prediction and prevention of new and (re-)emerging vector-borne diseases.","2022",NA,"10.3389/fpubh.2022.872812","WOS:000796981600001"
"Wu, YT; Brown, A; Ricklefs, RE","Host-specific soil microbes contribute to habitat restriction of closely related oaks (Quercus spp.)","ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","Habitat divergence among close relatives is a common phenomenon. Studying the mechanisms behind habitat divergence is fundamental to understanding niche partitioning, species diversification, and other evolutionary processes. Recent studies found that soil microbes regulate the abundance and diversity of plant species. However, it remains unclear whether soil microbes can affect the habitat distributions of plants and drive habitat divergence. To fill in this knowledge gap, we investigated whether soil microbes might restrict habitat distributions of closely related oaks (Quercus spp.) in eastern North America. We performed a soil inoculum experiment using two pairs of sister species (i.e., the most closely related species) that show habitat divergence: Quercus alba (local species) vs. Q. michauxii (foreign), and Q. shumardii (local) vs. Q. acerifolia (foreign). To test whether host-specific soil microbes are responsible for habitat restriction, we investigated the impact of local sister live soil (containing soil microbes associated with local sister species) on the survival and growth of local and foreign species. Second, to test whether habitat-specific soil microbes are responsible for habitat restriction, we examined the effect of local habitat live soil (containing soil microbes within local sister's habitats, but not directly associated with local sister species) on the seedlings of local and foreign species. We found that local sister live soil decreased the survival and biomass of foreign species' seedlings while increasing those of local species, suggesting that host-specific soil microbes could potentially mediate habitat exclusion. In contrast, local habitat live soil did not differentially affect the survival or biomass of the local vs. foreign species. Our study indicates that soil microbes associated with one sister species can suppress the recruitment of the other host species, contributing to the habitat partitioning of close relatives. Considering the complex interactions with soil microbes is essential for understanding the habitat distributions of closely related plants.","2022",NA,"10.1002/ece3.9614","WOS:000898497300001"

While the high affinity for ammonia of the comammox species Nitrospira inopinata suggests their niche partitioning is expected to be centered in oligotrophic environments, their absence in nutrient-depleted environments (such as the oceans) suggests that other (abiotic) factors might control their distribution and spatial localization within microbial communities. Many ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizing organisms are sensitive to light; however, the photosensitivity of comammox has not been explored. Since comammox bacteria encode enzymatic machinery homologous to canonical ammonia-and nitrite-oxidizers, we hypothesized that comammox N. inopinata, the only available pure culture of this group of microorganisms, may be inhibited by illumination in a similar manner. We evaluated the impact of light intensity, wavelength, and duration on the degree of photoinhibition for cultures of the comammox species N. inopinata and the soil ammonia-oxidizing archaea Nitrososphaera viennensis. Both species were highly sensitive to light. Interestingly, mimicking diurnal light exposure caused an uncoupling of ammonia and nitrite oxidation in N. inopinata, indicating nitrite oxidation might be more sensitive to light exposure than ammonia oxidation. It is likely that light influences comammox spatial distribution in natural environments such as surface fresh waters according to diurnal cycles, light attenuation coefficients, and the light penetration depths. Our findings therefore provide ecophysiological insights for further studies on comammox both in field and laboratory settings.","2022",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2022.1022899","WOS:000905514900001"

However, the role of diversity of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) in shaping nitrifier communities remains underexplored. This study deciphered the nitrifier community assembly by analyzing amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) of amoA and nxrB genes from soil microbiomes in forest and meadow ranging from the temperate monsoon to the tropic monsoon climate areas. The abundance, alpha-diversity, and 13-diversity of AOA, AOB, Nitrobacter, and Nitrospira were dominantly distinguished by geographical variation and less by vegetation type. The overall environmental factors, including the soil properties and climate factors, significantly correlated with the 13-diversity of AOA and Nitrospira, but not with AOB and Nitrobacter community. The assembly process of AOA was dominated by heterogeneous selection, while that of AOB, Nitrobacter, and Nitrospira by dispersal limitation. We found that AOA and Nitrospira dominated the combined nitrifier network, and several phylotypes exhibited extensive segregation between different modules, suggesting niche partition was present within subgroups or lineages of AOA, AOB, and Nitrospira. Links between different functional groups might reflect functional coupling, while links between the same lineage or subgroup could result from niche overlap or unknown mechanisms. As network connectors, some AOA and Nitrospira belonged to generalists, which could be essential to keep the stability of the network. Nitrospira inopinata-like node in module 24 suggested that comammox might not be an ecologically isolated bacterium in nitrification. We hypothesized that a balance between species sorting in AOA and dispersal limitation in AOB and NOB communities determined the species co-existence in the forest and meadow soils from temperate to tropical regions.

While the microorganisms of many crops such as soybean, rice, and maize have been studied, the root-associated microbial diversity of horticultural plants such as Paeonia lactiflora has been little studied. In this study, we investigated the composition, abundance, diversity and variability of microorganisms associated with different rhizospheric compartments (bulk soil, rhizosphere, rhizoplane, root endosphere) of different cultivars of P. lactiflora. We used the root and root-associated soil of a medicinal cultivar P. lactiflora cv 'Hang Baishao' (HS, 2n = 10) and an ornamental cultivar P. lactiflora cv 'Zi Fengyu' (ZFY, 2n = 10) as our study objectives. Based on Illumina Novaseq 6000 high-throughput sequencing, the 16S rRNA V4 amplicon of two cultivars of P. lactiflora root-associated bacterial communities and the ITS1-spanning amplicon of the fungal communities were sequenced, and the microbial communities were analyzed for relevant bioinformatics. Observed Species, Simpson, Shannon, and Chao1 indices showed that the microbial diversity of the rhizosphere was greater than that of the root, with the with the diversity decreasing from the bulk soil to the root endosphere. In addition, Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria were the most abundant of the root-associated bacterial communities, accounting for 19.59 % and 31.23 %, respectively. On the other hand, Ascomycota (37.74 %) and Basidiomycota (11.15 %) were the most dominant fungal communities in the four root-associated compartments.

The recent discovery of a novel bacterial process, complete ammonia oxidation (comammox, CMX), has refuted a century-long perception of the two-step conversion of NH3 to NO3-. Compared with canonical nitrifiers, CMX bacteria offer undeniable advantages, such as a high growth yield propensity and adaptability to nutrient-and growth-limiting conditions, which collectively draw attention to vali-date the aptness of CMX bacteria to wastewater treatment. As there has been no comprehensive review on the relevance of CMX bacteria for sustainable water and wastewater treatment, this review is intended to discuss the roles and applications of CMX in the removal of nitrogen and pollutants from water and wastewater. We took into account insights into the metabolic versatilities of CMX bacteria at the clade and subclade levels. We focused on the distribution of CMX bacteria in engineered systems, niche differ-entiation, co-occurrence and interactions with canonical nitrifiers for a better understanding of CMX bac-teria in terms of their ecophysiology. Conceptualized details on the reactor adaptability and stress response of CMX bacteria are provided. The potential of CMX bacteria to degrade micropollutants either directly or co-metabolically was evaluated, and these insights would be an indispensable advantage in opening the doors for wider applications of CMX bacteria in WWTPs.

However, knowledge of microeukaryotic community distribution patterns, assembly processes, and co-existence networks is greatly limited. Here, microbial eukaryotes in bulk and rhizosphere soils of the North China Plain were investigated. The results showed that soil pH was the driving factor for the microeukaryotic community composition in the bulk and rhizosphere soils. The soil microeukaryotic community could significantly differ between alkaline and acidic soils. The results indicated that the soil pH had a stronger effect than niche differences on community composition. Partial Mantel tests showed that soil pH and spatial distance had similar effects on the microeukaryotic community composition in the bulk soil. However, in the rhizosphere soil, spatial distance had a stronger effect than soil pH. Infer Community Assembly Mechanisms by Phylogenetic bin-based null model (iCAMP) analysis revealed that drift was the most important process driving microeukaryotic community assembly, with an average relative importance of 37.4-71.1%. Dispersal limitation displayed slightly greater importance in alkaline rhizosphere than in alkaline bulk soils. Meanwhile, the opposite trend was observed in acidic soils. In addition, the contribution of each assembly process to each iCAMP lineage bin varied according to the acidic or alkaline conditions of the soil and the niche environment. High proportions of positive links were found within the four ecological networks. Alkaline soil networks, especially the alkaline bulk soil network, showed greater complexity than the acidic soil networks. Natural connectivity analysis revealed that the rhizosphere community had a greater stability than the bulk soil community in alkaline soil.

Sexual dimorphism in morphology, physiology, or gene expression may relate to different microbial compositions that affect male and female fitness in different environments. However, sex-specific impacts on ecological processes that control the microbiome assembly are not well known. In this study, Populus cathayana males and females were planted in different nitrogen conditions. It was hypothesized that males and females differently affect bacterial and fungal communities in the rhizosphere soil, roots, old leaves, and young leaves. Physiological traits and transcriptome profiles of male and female plants were investigated to reveal potential mechanisms that control the microbiome assembly. Results: Our results showed strong niche differentiation that shapes microbial communities leading to a rapid loss of diversity along a decreasing pH gradient from the rhizosphere soil to leaves. Sex had different impacts on the microbial assembly in each niche. Especially fungal endophytes showed great differences in the community structure, keystone species, and community complexity between P. cathayana males and females. For example, the fungal co-occurrence network was more complex and the alpha diversity was significantly higher in young female leaves compared to young male leaves. Transcriptome profiles revealed substantial differences in plant-pathogen interactions and physiological traits that clearly demonstrated divergent internal environments for endophytes inhabiting males and females. Starch and pH of young leaves significantly affected the abundance of Proteobacteria, while tannin and pH of roots showed significant effects on the abundance of Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria, and on the bacterial Shannon diversity.

For example, Segata et al. discovered that the microbiomes of diverse habitats along the DT could be distinguished as 4 types (niches) including (i) stool; (ii) sub-gingival plaques (SubP) and supra-gingival plaques (SupP); (iii) tongue dorsum (TD), throat (TH), palatine tonsils (PT), and saliva (Sal); and (iv) hard palate (HP) and buccal mucosa (BM), and keratinized gingiva (KG). These niches are different not only in composition, but also in metabolic potentials. In a previous study, we applied Harris et al's multi-site neutral and Tang and Zhou's niche-neutral hybrid models to characterize the DT niches discovered by Segata et al. Here, we complement the previous study by applying Sloan's near-neural model and Ning et al's stochasticity analysis framework to quantify the niche-neutral continuum of the DT microbiome distribution to shed light on the possible ecological/evolutionary mechanism that shapes the continuum. Overall but excluding the stool site, the proportion of neutral OTUs (46%) is slightly higher than that of the positive selection (38%), but significantly higher than negative selection (15%). The gut (stool) exhibited 3 to 12 times lower neutrality than other DT sites. The analysis also cross-verified our previous hypothesis that the KG (keratinized gingiva) is of distinct assembly dynamics in the DT microbiome, should be treated as a fifth niche. Our findings offer new insight on the long-standing debate concerning whether a minimum of 2-mm of KG width is necessary for marginal periodontal health.","2022",NA,"10.1177/11769343221128540","WOS:000928097300001"

However, it is seldom measured or quantified how much deterministic versus stochastic processes contribute to community assembly in alpine meadows. Here, we measured the decay in community similarity with spatial and environmental distance in the Zoige Plateau. Furthermore, we used redundancy analysis (RDA) to divide the variations in the relative abundance of plant families into four components to assess the effects of environmental and spatial. Species assemblage similarity liner declined with geographical distance (p < .001, R-2 = .6388), and it decreased significantly with increasing distance of total phosphorus (TP), alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen (AN), available potassium (AK), nitrate nitrogen (NO3+-N), and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N). Environmental and spatial variables jointly explained a large proportion (55.2%) of the variation in the relative abundance of plant families. Environmental variables accounted for 13.1% of the total variation, whereas spatial variables accounted for 11.4%, perhaps due to the pronounced abiotic gradients in the alpine areas. Our study highlights the mechanism of plant community assembly in the alpine ecosystem, where environmental filtering plays a more important role than dispersal limitation. In addition, a reasonably controlled abundance of Compositae (the family with the highest niche breadth and large niche overlap value with Gramineae and Cyperaceae) was expected to maintain sustainable development in pastoral production.

To assess enzymatic reactions in soil thin layer at the microscopic level, we developed a micro-zymography approach and tested it by visualization of the potential activity of phosphomonoesterase for aggregates collected from the rhizosphere of Zea mays L. Methods We evaluated micro-zymography by applying fluorogenically-labeled substrate i) on individual soil aggregates freshly sampled from the rhizosphere, ii) on thin layers of aggregates (approximate to 500 mu m) saturated with substrate to assess the dynamics of phosphomonoesterase activity, and iii) on maize roots under laser scanning microscope upon the identified hotspots by membrane-based zymography. Results We found super transparent silicon as the most appropriate fixative to prevent sample drying. We optimized microscope settings to eliminate the soil auto-fluorescence. The fluorescent signal shifted from the free liquid phase towards the aggregate boundaries within 30 min after substrate addition and was finally detectable at the surface of a few aggregates. This was probably due to higher microbial abundance and enzymatic activity on the soil aggregates compared to the liquid phase. The enzymatic activity appeared patchy at the aggregate and root surfaces indicating heterogeneous distribution of hotspots. Conclusions The methodology including calibration, sample preparation, fixation, and monitoring was developed. The novel membrane-free micro-zymography approach is a promising tool to identify functional specificity and niche differentiation on roots and soil aggregates. This approach revealed unexplained complexity of competing processes (biochemical, hydrolytic, and physical) due to differently charged reaction products and enzyme-clay complexes.","2022","JUL 2022","10.1007/s11104-022-05573-4","WOS:000820569800002"

Therefore, we investigated the community structure of soil bacteria in the active, transition and permafrost layers based on 90 soil samples collected from 10 sites across the continuous permafrost region using high-throughput Illumina sequencing. Results Proteobacteria (31.59%), Acidobacteria (18.63%), Bacteroidetes (9.74%), Chloroflexi (7.01%) and Actinobacteria (6.92%) were the predominant phyla of the bacterial community in all soil layers; however, the relative abundances of the dominant bacterial taxa varied with soil depth. The bacterial community alpha-diversity based on the Shannon index and the phylogenetic diversity index both decreased significantly with depth across the transition from active layer to permafrost layer. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis and permutation multivariate analysis of variance revealed that microbial community structures were significantly different among layers. Redundancy analysis and Spearman's correlation analysis showed that soil properties differed between layers such as soil nutrient content, temperature and moisture mainly drove the differentiation of bacterial communities. Conclusions Our results revealed significant differences in bacterial composition and diversity among soil layers. Our findings suggest that the heterogeneous environmental conditions between the three soil horizons had strong influences on microbial niche differentiation and further explained the variability of soil bacterial community structures.

In terms of the degree of species interaction, the protist communities were ranked as follows: surface and bottom of WAR > ARs and WAR > different layers of ARs. The alpha-diversity of protists associated with ARs and WAR decreased with an increase in depth. Protist diversity was greater in WAR than in ARs. beta-Diversity analysis revealed significant differences in protist community structure between WAR and ARs (P < 0.05), and the upper layers of ARs and the middle or bottom layers of ARs differed. The key topological features of protist networks showed more positive interspecific interactions in the AR-associated protist community, a higher degree of niche differentiation, and higher complexity and stability. The keystone protists in the bottom seawater layer displayed community functions that were biased toward initial fixation in the ocean carbon cycle. The AR-associated protist community tended to participate in carbon transfer in the food chain and decomposition and utilization of dissolved organic matter (DOM). This study revealed significant differences in protist community structure between ARs and the adjacent environment, and the ecological functions of the key phyla were found to be related.

In this field study, we determined the impact of simulated climate change (a warmer and drier condition) and its legacy effect on CH4 emissions and the methanogenic and methanotrophic communities, as well as their relationships with ammonia oxidizers in an acidic soil with urea application. The climate change conditions were simulated in a greenhouse, and the legacy effect was simulated by removing the greenhouse after twelve months. Simulated climate change significantly decreased the in situ CH4 emissions in the urea-treated soils while the legacy effect significantly decreased the in situ CH4 emissions in the control plots, but had very little effect in the urea-treated soils. This indicates that the impact of simulated climate change and its legacy on CH4 emissions was significantly modified by nitrogen fertilization. Methanotrophs were more sensitive than methanogens in response to simulated climate change and its legacy effect, especially in the urea treated soil. Significant negative correlations were observed between the abundances of ammonia oxidizers and methanotrophs. Additionally, results of partial least path modeling (PLS-PM) indicated that the interactions of methanogens and methanotrophs with ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) had significant positive relationships with in situ CH4 emissions under the simulated climate change condition. Our work highlights the important role of AOA for CH4 emissions under climate change conditions. Further research is needed to better understand this effect in other ecosystems.

With the increase in parental genetic distance, the intensity of genetic isolation between them also increases. Will the increase in parental ecological niche differences also lead to the increase in ecological isolation intensity between them? This question is difficult to answer based on the current literature due to the lack of hybridization cases of contrasting ecological niche parents. Results Cyprinid fish parents (Schizothorax wangchiachii and Percocypris pingi) with contrasting ecological niches (herbivorous and carnivorous) and their F1 hybrids were used as research objects. Fish and periphytic algae were selected as food corresponding to different parental resources. The foraging-related traits of these hybrids are generally the same between parents; however, the intermediate foraging traits of hybrids did not result in intermediate foraging performance for parental resources, and these hybrids could hardly forage for parental resources. The poor foraging performance of these hybrids for parental resources was caused not only by the decline in the foraging ability of these hybrids but, more importantly, by the decrease in foraging activity. Interestingly, these hybrids initially showed a high interest in foraging small fishes; however, after the first successful capture, these hybrids had difficulty ingesting fish and spit them out, which led to the subsequent decrease in foraging activity. We designed a series of experiments to explore the mechanism of the fish spitting of these hybrids, excluding the taste and the size of prey, and found that the decrease in their pharyngeal tooth puncture ability may be the reason. Conclusions This study was the first to demonstrate that these parents with contrasting ecological niches will produce great postzygotic ecological isolation for parental resources. The poor foraging performance of these hybrids for parental resources is mainly due to the decrease in foraging activity. Interestingly, these hybrids have obvious fish-spitting behaviour, which is a typical example of the incompatibility between intermediate traits and genetic behaviors.","2021",NA,"10.1186/s12983-021-00401-4","WOS:000642164500001"

Microbial kinetics of Nitrobacter have been widely reported and are used to model the nitrite oxidation process and optimize the design parameters of the biological processes for wastewater treatment. However, limited information is available about the nitrite oxidation kinetics of the two coexisting Nitrobacter stains, namely the Nitrobacter winogradskyi and the Nitrobacter hamburgensis. The current work mainly focuses on the influence of temperature on the kinetic characteristics of the coexistence of N. winogradskyi and hamburgensis, which were enriched in a lab-scale sequencing batch reactor (SBR) through 419 operating cycles. The results for the kinetic properties of nitrite oxidation of the enrichments within the temperature range of 15-35 degrees C showed that the maximum specific rate (r(max)), half-saturation co-efficients (K-S), growth-rate constants (mu(max)), and temperature coefficient (theta) lied within the ranges of 22.91-93.58 mM/g/d, 0.13-2.47 mM, 0.026-0.105 1/d, and 1.038-1.137, respectively. The maximum activity and nitrite affinities of tested microorganisms were sensitive to temperature. Furthermore, the relationships between temperature and normalized kinetic parameters (r(max), mu(max), and theta) were developed as: 0.069T-0.076 (15-30 degrees C), 0.0057T-0.062 (15-30 degrees C), and 5.7T/40.9+T+T-2/10.5 (15-35 degrees C), respectively. Moreover, the capabilities of N. winogradskyi and N. hamburgensis to oxidize nitrite were lost at the temperature of 35 degrees C and were non-recoverable at temperature of 25 degrees C.

The biogeography of soil fungi has attracted much attention in recent years; however, the seasonal patterns of soil fungal community structure and diversity along altitudinal gradients under the unique climatic conditions at high latitudes remain unclear, which limits our insight into soil microbial interactions and the mechanisms of community assembly. In this study, Illumina MiSeq sequencing was used to investigate the spatiotemporal changes in soil fungal communities along an altitudinal gradient (from 750 m to 1420 m) on Oakley Mountain in the northern Greater Khingan Mountains. Altitude had significant impacts on the relative abundances of the dominant phyla and classes of soil fungi, and the interaction of altitude and season significantly affected the relative abundances of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. The number of soil fungal taxa and Faith's phylogenetic diversity index tended to monotonically decline with increasing elevation. Soil moisture, soil temperature and pH were the main factors affecting fungal community structure in May, July and September, respectively. The soil dissolved organic carbon content significantly shaped the soil fungal community composition along the altitudinal gradient throughout the growing season. Compared to that in May and July, the soil fungal network in September had more nodes and links, a higher average degree and a higher average clustering coefficient. The nine module nodes in the co-occurrence network were all Ascomycota taxa, and the identities of the keystone taxa of soil fungi in the network showed obvious seasonality. Our results demonstrated that altitude has stronger effects than season on soil fungal community structure and diversity at high latitudes. In addition, the co-occurrence network of soil fungi exhibited obvious seasonal succession, which indicated that the keystone taxa of soil fungi exhibit niche differentiation among seasons.","2021","MAY 2021","10.1016/j.catena.2021.105448","WOS:000657369600059"

It was found that, when the traditional default P-value = 0.05 was specified, the neutral drifts were predominant (>= 50% metacommunities indistinguishable from the MSN prediction), while the niche differentiations were moderate (<20% from the NNH prediction). The study also analyzed two challenging uncertainties in testing the neutral and/or niche-neutral hybrid models, i.e., lack of full model specificity - non-unique fittings of same datasets to multiple models with potentially different mechanistic assumptions - and lack of definite rules for setting the P-value thresholds (also noted as P-t-value when referring to the threshold of P-value in this article) in testing null hypothesis (model). Indeed, the two uncertainties can be interdependent, which further complicates the statistical inferences. To deal with the uncertainties, the MSN/NNH test results under a series of P-values ranged from 0.05 to 0.95 were presented. Furthermore, the influence of P-value threshold-setting on the model specificity, and the effects of woman's health status on the neutrality level of HVM were examined. It was found that with the increase of P-value threshold from 0.05 to 0.95, the overlap (non-unique) fitting of MSN and NNH decreased from 29.1 to 1.3%, whereas the specificity (uniquely fitted to data) of MSN model was kept between 55.7 and 82.3%. Also with the rising P-value threshold, the difference between healthy and BV groups become significant. These findings suggested that traditional single P-value threshold (such as the de facto standard P-value = 0.05) might be insufficient for testing the neutral and/or niche neutral hybrid models.","2021",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2021.699939","WOS:000696600900001"

In complex natural food webs, however, trophic niche parameters depicted by single and isolated methods may simplify the multidimensional nature of consumer trophic niches, which includes feeding processes such as food choice, ingestion, digestion, assimilation and retention. Here we explore the correlation and complementarity of trophic niche parameters tackled by four complementary methodological approaches, that is, visual gut content, digestive enzyme, fatty acid and stable isotope analyses-each assessing one or few feeding processes, and demonstrate the power of method combination. Focusing on soil ecosystems, where many omnivore species with cryptic feeding habits coexist, we chose Collembola as an example. We compiled 15 key trophic niche parameters for 125 species from 40 studies. We assessed correlations among trophic niche parameters and described variation of these parameters in different Collembola species, families and across life-forms, which represent microhabitat specialisation. Correlation between trophic niche parameters was weak in 45 out of 64 pairwise comparisons, pointing at complementarity of the four methods. Jointly, the results indicated that fungal- and plant-feeding Collembola assimilate storage, rather than structural polysaccharides, and suggested bacterial feeding as a potential alternative feeding strategy. Gut content and fatty acid analyses suggested alignment between ingestion and assimilation/retention processes in fungal- and plant-feeding Collembola. From the 15 trophic niche parameters, six were related to Collembola family identity, suggesting that not all trophic niche dimensions are phylogenetically structured. Only three parameters were related to the life-forms, suggesting that species use various feeding strategies when living in the same microenvironments. Consumers can meet their nutritional needs by varying their food choices, ingestion and digestion strategies, with the connection among different feeding processes being dependent on the consumed resource and consumer adaptations. Multiple methods reveal different dimensions, together drawing a comprehensive picture of the trophic niche. Future studies applying the multidimensional trophic niche approach will allow us to trace trophic complexity and reveal niche partitioning of omnivorous species and their functional roles, especially in cryptic environments such as soils, caves, deep ocean or benthic ecosystems.","2021","MAY 2021","10.1111/1365-2656.13511","WOS:000656250200001"

One under-explored application is assembly of communities from the built-environment, especially during process disturbances. Anaerobic digestion for biological wastewater treatment is often underpinned by retaining millions of active granular biofilm aggregates. Flotation of granules is a major problem, resulting in process failure. Anaerobic aggregates were sampled from three identical bioreactors treating dairy wastewater. Microbiome structure was analysed using qPCR and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing from DNA and cDNA. A comprehensive null-model approach quantified assembly mechanisms of floating and settled communities. Significant differences in diversity were observed between floating and settled granules, in particular, we highlight the changing abundances of Methanosaeta and Lactococcus. Both stochastic and deterministic processes were important for community assembly. Homogeneous selection was the primary mechanism for all categories, but dispersal processes also contributed. The lottery model was used to identify clade-level competition driving community assembly. Lottery winners were identified with different winners between floating and settled groups. Some groups changed their winner status when flotation occurred. Spirochaetaceae, for example, was only a winner in settled biomass (cDNA-level) and lost its winner status during flotation. Alternatively, Arcobacter butzerli gained winner status during flotation. This analysis provides a deeper understanding of changes that occur during process instabilities and identified groups which may be washed out-an important consideration for process control.","2021",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2021.666584","WOS:000655497300001"

However, the relative importance of autotrophic nitrification and the related active nitrifiers during mineralization of organic substances with different C/N ratios have not been fully elucidated to date. In this study, N-15 tracing and (CO2)-C-13-DNA-based stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) techniques were employed to investigate the responses of soil nitrification processes and the active nitrifying phylotypes in acidic and neutral paddy soils with amendment of glutamine (Gln) or rice straw with low C/N (LS) or high C/N (HS). Acetylene (C2H2) was utilized to differentiate autotrophic and heterotrophic nitrification. The results indicated that C2H2 completely blocked the production of (NO3-)-N-15 in Gln and LS treatments, implying the predominance of autotrophic nitrification with the N derived from the mineralization of Gln and LS. Neither (NH4+)-N-15 nor (NO3-)-N-15 was detected in the HS-amended soils, suggesting that NH4+ derived from organic N mineralization was immobilized immediately by microorganisms. In the DNA-SIP microcosms, the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in the unamended control (CK), Gln and LS treatments of acidic paddy soil increased by 22.1-, 71.9- and 27.6-fold, respectively. A significantly larger proportion of Nitrosospira-like AOB, rather than ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and comammox Nitrospira, was labelled by (CO2)-C-13, indicating that AOB made a stronger contribution to autotrophic nitrification in acidic paddy soil. The active nitrification of neutral paddy soil was predominated by AOA affiliated with the Nitrososphaera viennensis lineage in the CK and LS microcosms but by Nitrosospira-like AOB in the Gln microcosm. These results suggest the significance of autotrophic nitrification catalysed by canonical ammonia oxidizers, rather than comammox, during the mineralization of organic substances with low C/N in paddy soils.","2021","MAR 2021","10.1016/j.soilbio.2021.108192","WOS:000640189100009"

This study analyzes amplicon sequence variant (ASV) diversity and co occurrence of prokaryotic (Archaea and Bacteria) communities through coastal-oceanic gradients in the NW Iberian upwelling system and adjacent open-ocean (Atlantic Ocean). Biogeographic patterns were investigated in relation with environmental conditions, mainly focusing on the optical signature of the dissolved organic matter (DOM). Alpha and beta-diversity were horizontally homogeneous [with the only exception of Archaea (similar to 1700 m depth), attributed to the influence of Mediterranean water, MW], while beta diversity was significantly vertically stratified. Prokaryotic communities were structured in four clusters (upper subsurface, lower subsurface, intermediate, and deep clusters). Deep (>2000 m) archaeal and bacterial assemblages, and intermediate (500-2000 m) Bacteria (mainly SAR202 and SAR406), were significantly related to humic-like DOM (FDOM-M), while intermediate Archaea were additionally related to biogeochemical attributes of the high-salinity signature of MW. Lower subsurface (100-500 m) Archaea (particularly one ASV belonging to the genus Candidatus Nitrosopelagicus) were mainly related to the imprint of high-salinity MW, while upper subsurface (<= 100 m) archaeal assemblages (particularly some ASVs belonging to Marine Group II) were linked to protein-like DOM (aCDOM254). Conversely, both upper and lower subsurface bacterial assemblages were mainly linked to aCDOM254 (particularly ASVs belonging to Rhodobacteraceae, Cyanobacteria, and Flavobacteriaceae) and nitrite concentration (mainly members of Planctomycetes). Most importantly, our analysis unveiled depth ecotypes, such as the ASVs MarG.II_1 belonging to the archaeal deep cluster (linked to FDOM-M) and MarG.II_2 belonging to the upper subsurface cluster (related to FDOM-T and aCDOM254). This result strongly suggests DOM-mediated vertical niche differentiation, with further implications for ecosystem functioning. Similarly, positive and negative co-occurrence relationships also suggested niche partitioning (e.g., between the closely related ASVs Thaum._Nit._Nit._Nit._1 and _2) and competitive exclusion (e.g., between Thaum._Nit._Nit._Nit._4 and _5), supporting the finding of non-randomly, vertically structured prokaryotic communities. Overall, differences between Archaea and Bacteria and among closely related ASVs were revealed in their preferential relationship with compositional changes in the DOM pool and environmental forcing.

Conservative soil management may have the ability to reduce N2O emissions through affecting a number of Ncycling-related soil biophysical properties. Using in situ N2O measurements combined with the techniques of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), amplicon sequencing, and metagenomic sequencing, we aimed to understand the effects of long-term (>10 y) conservation tillage (i.e., zero- and chisel-till vs. conventional plow-till) on soil N2O production and associated microbial guilds following inorganic N fertilizer application in maize. Between 2017 and 2019, continuous in situ measurements of N2O fluxes indicated that both zero- and chisel-till significantly lowered cumulative emissions within the growing season, compared to plow-till, mainly through shortening the duration and reducing the magnitude of post-fertilization emission events. Conservative soil management, in particular zero-till, consistently increased the Shannon diversity index of bacterial community over the growing season, compared with plow-till. High-frequency qPCR analyses further revealed a clear tillage-induced niche differentiation between nosZI- and nosZII-N2O reducers, as evidenced by the dominant gene abundance of nosZII compared to nosZI in the conservation tillage soil, which eventually probably contributed to the transformation of N2O to N-2. Moreover, compared to plow-till, zero-till significantly decreased gene abundances involved in N2O production including the nirS, nirK, and narG genes, but increased abundances of N2O reduction genes such as nosZ during peak N2O emissions. Critically, the abundances of detected species involved in denitrification, such as Deltaproteobacteria_bacterium spp. and Alphaproteobacteria_bacterium spp. were clearly inhibited by zero-till. Overall, the reduced soil N2O emissions under reduced tillage positively and strongly depended on the nosZI-to-nosZII ratio, while increased emissions due to conventional tillage were positively associated with intensified denitrification. Such improvements in understanding of the responses of N-cycling gene abundances to tillage intensity can certainly help in the development of updated soil management practices and adaptative N application strategies to reduce reactive N emissions in agricultural ecosystems.","2021","APR 2021","10.1016/j.soilbio.2021.108239","WOS:000643701100010"

Here, we attempted to perform layered comparative stochasticity analyses across animal species (including humans), class, and kingdom scales, corresponding to microbial meta community, landscape, and global-landscape scales. By analyzing 4,903 microbiome samples from 274 animal species covering 4 major invertebrate classes and all 6 vertebrate classes and including 1,787 human gut microbiome samples, we discovered the following: (i) at the microbial metacommunity (animal species) scale, although the general trend of stochasticity (measured in the relationships between fundamental biodiversity/dispersal numbers of Hubbell's neutral theory and host species phylogenetic timeline) seems continuous, there seems to be a turning point from animals to humans in the passing rate of neutrality tests (12% to 45% versus 100%). We postulate that it should be the human experiences from agricultural/industrial activities (e.g., diet effects) and frequent social/familial contacts that are responsible for the dramatically rising stochastic neutrality in human gut microbiomes. (ii) At the microbial landscape (animal class) and global landscape (animal kingdom) scales, neutrality is not detectable, suggesting that the landscape is niche differentiated-animal species may possess home niches for their coadapted microbiomes.

A prominent example of those is the consistent association of diatoms with Alphaproteobacteria of the order Rhodobacterales. These photoheterotrophic bacteria have traditionally been described as generalists that scavenge dissolved organic matter. Many observations suggest that members of this clade are specialized in colonizing the microenvironment of diatom cells, known as the phycosphere. However, the molecular mechanisms that differentiate Rhodobacterales generalists and phycosphere colonizers are poorly understood. We investigated Rhodobacterales in the North Sea during the 2010-2012 spring blooms using a time series of 38 deeply sequenced metagenomes and 10 metaproteomes collected throughout these events. Rhodobacterales metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) were recurrently abundant. They exhibited the highest gene enrichment and protein expression of small-molecule transporters, such as monosaccharides, thiamine and polyamine transporters, and anaplerotic pathways, such as ethylmalonyl and propanoyl-CoA metabolic pathways, all suggestive of a generalist lifestyle. Metaproteomes indicated that the species represented by these MAGs were the dominant suppliers of vitamin B-12 during the blooms, concomitant with a significant enrichment of genes related to vitamin B-12 biosynthesis suggestive of association with diatom phycospheres. A closer examination of putative generalists and colonizers showed that putative generalists had persistently higher relative abundance throughout the blooms and thus produced more than 80% of Rhodobacterales transport proteins, suggesting rapid growth. In contrast, putative phycosphere colonizers exhibited large fluctuation in relative abundance across the different blooms and correlated strongly with particular diatom species that were dominant during the blooms each year. The defining feature of putative phycosphere colonizers is the presence of the tight adherence (tad) gene cluster, which is responsible for the assembly of adhesive pili that presumably enable attachment to diatom hosts. In addition, putative phycosphere colonizers possessed higher prevalence of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters, particularly homoserine lactones, which can regulate bacterial attachment through quorum sensing. Altogether, these findings suggest that while many members of Rhodobacterales are competitive during diatom blooms, only a subset form close associations with diatoms by colonizing their phycospheres.","2021",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2021.718297","WOS:000716728600001"

However, the relationship between plant diversity and soil microbial diversity is elusive. Moreover, it remains unknown whether plant diversity loss will cause the stability of soil microbial communities to deteriorate. To shed light on these questions, we conducted a pot-based experiment to manipulate the plant richness gradient (1, 2, 4, or 8 species) and plant [Symphyorrichum subulatum (Michx.) G.

We found that, in the noninvasion treatment, soil fungal diversity significantly and positively correlated with plant diversity, while the relationship between bacterial and plant diversity was not significant. Under plant invasion conditions, the coupling of plant-fungal alpha diversity relationship was enhanced, but the plant-fungal beta diversity relationship was decoupled. We also found significant positive relationships between plant diversity and soil microbial resistance. The observed positive relationships were determined by turnover (species substitution) and nestedness (species loss) processes for bacterial and fungal communities, respectively.

While effects of deforestation on aboveground interactions have been well studied, the responses of interactions among plant, soil bacterial and fungal communities to deforestation are pooly understood and their effects on vegetation restoration remain unknown. We sequenced soil 16S rRNA and ITS genes from the primary forest without logging history and secondary forests that had been clear cut or selective cut and left to recover for up to 50 years in the typical tropical rainforest in Hainan Island. Soil bacterial-fungal, plant-bacterial and plant-fungal associations were illustrated via ecological network analysis, and their correlations with plant composition, soil and litter properties were examined to explore the links to ecosystem functions. A higher negative proportion of bacterial-fungal interactions was found in selective cut sites while a higher positive proportion presented in clear cut sites. The changes after selective cut was related to tree composition and reductions in nitrogen and phosphorus content from soil and litter, indicating increased competition for nutrients, decoupling of communities and niche differentiation. The bacterial-fungal interaction changes after clear cut was associated with decrease in tree biomass and soil carbon content while increase in litter carbon content, implying increased co-operation in nutrient strategies and community homogenization. This ecological implications of bacterial-fungal interaction after clear cut was also applicable to plant-microbial interaction showing modular structure and strong across-module associations and significant correlations with litter carbon and soil nitrogen availability, which was indicative of a particular collection of microbial members under given plant species driving by changes in carbon and nitrogen content. Overall, the responses of bacterial-fungal and plant?microbe interactions to selective cut may in term promote the recovery of plant diversity during forest restoration, whereas these responses to clear cut may hinder the recovery of plant community diversity, and more costly restoration approaches based on different tree species planting will be required. This study suggested that the interkingdom interactions in below-aboveground metacommunity are indicative of changes in tree composition and soil fertility during the restoration of logged forest, and changes in such interkingdom interactions could in turn influence plant diversity and soil nutrients transformation.","2021","APR 2021","10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119182","WOS:000647735500005"

BS01 is restricted to the lower-salinity surface waters, while OM43 is found throughout the halocline.

Phylogenetic reconstruction shows that BS01 colonized the pelagic ocean independently of OM43 via convergent evolution. Salinity adaptation and differences in one-carbon and nitrogen metabolism may play a role in niche differentiation between BS01 and OM43. In particular, urea utilization by BS01 is predicted to provide an ecological advantage over OM43 given the limited amount of inorganic nitrogen in the Canada Basin. These observations provide further evidence that the Arctic Ocean is inhabited by distinct bacterial groups and that at least one group (BS01) evolved via a freshwater to marine environmental transition. IMPORTANCE Global warming is profoundly influencing the Arctic Ocean. Rapid ice melt and increased freshwater input is increasing ocean stratification, driving shifts in nutrient availability and the primary production that supports marine food webs. Determining bacterial responses to Arctic Ocean change is challenging because of limited knowledge on the specific adaptations of Arctic Ocean bacteria. In this study, we investigated the diversity and genomic adaptations of a globally distributed group of marine bacteria, the Methylophilaceae, in the surface waters of the Arctic Ocean. We discovered a novel lineage of marine Methylophilaceae inhabiting the Arctic Ocean whose evolutionary origin involved a freshwater to marine environmental transition. Crossing the salinity barrier is thought to rarely occur in bacterial evolution. However, given the ongoing freshening of the Arctic Ocean, our results suggest that these relative newcomers to the ocean microbiome increase in abundance and, therefore, ecological significance in a near-future Arctic Ocean.","2021",NA,"10.1128/mBio.01306-21","WOS:000693451600004"

Viral impacts are important in groundwater ecosystems, where microbes drive many nutrient fluxes and metabolic processes; however, little is known about the diversity of viruses in these environments. We analyzed four groundwater plasmidomes (the entire plasmid content of an environment) and iden-tified 200 viral sequences, which clustered into 41 genus-level viral clusters (approxi-mately equivalent to viral genera) including 9 known and 32 putative new genera. We used publicly available bacterial whole-genome sequences (WGS) and WGS from 261 bacterial isolates from this groundwater environment to identify potential viral hosts. We linked 76 of the 200 viral sequences to a range of bacterial phyla, the ma-jority associated with Proteobacteria, followed by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria. The publicly available WGS enabled mapping bacterial hosts to sev-eral viral sequences. The WGS of groundwater isolates increased the depth of host prediction by allowing host identification at the strain level. The latter included 4 viruses that were almost entirely (>99% query coverage, >99% identity) identified as integrated in the genomes of Pseudomonas, Acidovorax, and Castellaniella strains, resulting in high-confidence host assignments. Lastly, 21 of these viruses carried pu-tative auxiliary metabolite genes for metal and antibiotic resistance, which might drive their infection cycles and/or provide selective advantage to infected hosts. Exploring the groundwater virome provides a necessary foundation for integration of viruses into ecosystem models where they are key players in microbial adaption to environmental stress. IMPORTANCE To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify the bacteriophage distribution in a groundwater ecosystem shedding light on their prevalence and distribution across metal-contaminated and background sites. Our study is uniquely based on selective sequencing of solely the extrachromosomal elements of a micro-biome followed by analysis for viral signatures, thus establishing a more focused approach for phage identifications. Using this method, we detected several novel phage genera along with those previously established. Our approach of using the whole-genome sequences of hundreds of bacterial isolates from the same site enabled us to make host assignments with high confidence, several at strain levels. Certain phage genes suggest that they provide an environment-specific selective advantage to their bacterial hosts. Our study lays the foundation for future research on directed phage isolations using specific bacterial host strains to further character-ize groundwater phages, their life cycles, and their effects on groundwater micro-biome and biogeochemistry.","2021",NA,"10.1128/mSystems.00537-21","WOS:000709919700007"

Our ability to out-select nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) from activated sludge is challenged by their metabolic and physiological diversity, warranting measurements of their in situ physiology and activity under selective growth pressures. Here, we examined the stability of nitrite oxidation in activated sludge during a press disturbance induced by treating a portion of return activated sludge with a sidestream flow containing free ammonia (FA) at 200 mg NH3-N/liter. The nitrite accumulation ratio peaked at 42% by day 40 in the experimental bioreactor with the press disturbance, while it did not increase in the control bioreactor. A subsequent decrease in nitrite accumulation within the experimental bioreactor coincided with shifts in dominant Nitrospira 16S rRNA amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). We applied bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) coupled with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to investigate changes in the translational activity of NOB populations throughout batch exposure to FA. BONCAT-FACS confirmed that the single Nitrospira ASV washed out of the experimental bioreactor had reduced translational activity following exposure to FA, whereas the two Nitrospira ASVs that emerged after process acclimation were not impacted by FA. Thus, the coexistence of functionally degenerate and physiologically resistant Nitrospira populations provided resilience to the nitrite-oxidizing function during the press disturbance. These results highlight how BONCAT-FACS can resolve ecological niche differentiation within activated sludge and inform strategies to engineer and control microbiome function. IMPORTANCE Nitrogen removal from activated sludge wastewater treatment systems is an energy-intensive process due to the large aeration requirement for nitrification. This energy footprint could be minimized with engineering control strategies that wash out nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) to limit oxygen demands. However, NOB populations can have a high degree of physiological diversity, and it is currently difficult to decipher the behavior of individual taxa during applied selective pressures. Here, we utilized a new substrate analog probing approach to measure the activity of NOB at the cellular translational level in the face of a press disturbance applied to the activated sludge process. Substrate analog probing corroborated the time series reactor sampling, showing that coexisting and functionally degenerate Nitrospira populations provided resilience to the nitrite oxidation process. Taken together, these results highlight how substrate analog approaches can illuminate in situ ecophysiologies within shared niches, and can inform strategies to improve microbiome engineering and management.","2021",NA,"10.1128/mSystems.00712-21","WOS:000709832000003"

Habitat transformation can drastically alter macromycete communities and diminish the contribution of these organisms to ecosystem functioning; however, knowledge on the effect of urbanization on macrofungal communities is scarce. Diversity metrics based on functional traits of macromycete species have shown to be valuable tools to predict how species contribute to ecosystem functionality since traits determine the performance of species in ecosystems. The aim of this study was to assess patterns of species richness, functional diversity, and composition of macrofungi in an urban ecosystem in Southwest Mexico, and to identify microclimatic, environmental, and urban factors related to these patterns in order to infer the effect of urbanization on macromycete communities. We selected four oak forests along an urbanization gradient and established a permanent sampling area of 0.1 ha at each site. Macromycete sampling was carried out every week from June to October 2017. The indices used to measure functional diversity were functional richness (FRic), functional divergence (FDig), and functional evenness (FEve). The metric used to assess variation of macrofungal ecological function along the study area was the functional value. We recorded a total of 134 macromycete species and 223 individuals. Our results indicated a decline of species richness with increased urbanization level related mainly to microclimatic variables, and a high turnover of species composition among study sites, which appears to be related to microclimatic and urbanization variables. FRic decreased with urbanization level, indicating that some of the available resources in the niche space within the most urbanized sites are not being utilized. FDig increased with urbanization, which suggests a high degree of niche differentiation among macromycete species within communities in urbanized areas. FEve did not show notable differences along the urbanization gradient, indicating few variations in the distribution of abundances within the occupied sections of the niche space. Similarly, the functional value was markedly higher in the less urbanized site, suggesting greater performance of functional guilds in that area. Our findings suggest that urbanization has led to a loss of macromycete species and a decrease in functional diversity, causing some sections of the niche space to be hardly occupied and available resources to be under-utilized, which could, to a certain extent, affect ecosystem functioning and stability.","2021",NA,"10.7717/peerj.12191","WOS:000698571400001"

Chicken meats were defrosted using room temperature, running tap water, or high-frequency defroster. Marinated meats with herbal extract solution were treated with superheated steam and then hot smoked with wood sawdust; sensory evaluations were performed at each processing step. The products were analyzed for fatty acids and nutrients, along with storage tests under different conditions. High-frequency defrosting showed the lowest drip loss and thawing time compared to other methods. Bay leaves and oak wood were selected as the best sub-materials for higher sensory scores. Optimal superheated steam conditions showed higher overall acceptance (8.86, 8.71) and were set as follows; leg meat (225 degrees C; 12 min 20 s), breast meat (223 degrees C; 8 min 40 s). The final meat products possessed good nutritional composition and no severe sensory spoilages were detected during storage despite microbial and chemical degradations.

Granule recovery in both structure and activity is important for scale-up and stability of AGS, but information about the structure recovery of stored AGS is limited. In addition, whether short-term exogenous N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) regulations could accelerate the granule recovery and sustain positive effects on AGS is unknown. Herein, the recovery of 33-month stored AGS was performed in three reactors for 38 days (phase I) at different exogenous AHLs concentrations (0, 50 and 500 nM of AHL-mixtures in R0, R1 and R2, respectively) and for an extended 45 days without exogenous AHLs (phase II). Results demonstrated successful recovery of disintegrated AGS in all reactors, although it was relatively time-consuming in R0. The treatment performance was similar among the reactors and steady-state removal of COD (90%) and NH4+-N (94%) could be recovered within 7 and 21 days, respectively. However, exogenous AHLs regulation (especially in R1) obviously accelerated bioactivity recovery of heterotmphs and nitrifiers and improved granule characteristics, including biomass, density, hydrophobicity and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS). During phase II, sustainable positive effects remained in R1, but granule characteristics deteriorated in R2. The abundance of functional genera Thauera, Nitrosomonas and Candidatus Nitrotoga, contributed to the rapid recovery and helped maintain the structure and activity of AGS. The predictive functional profiling of bacterial communities also demonstrated sustainably higher activities of metabolism, growth and signal sensing under exogenous AHLs regulation at an appropriate content.","2021","MAY 2021","10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.130894","WOS:000665491400092"

Therefore, the possibility of integrating Se enriched bacteria as a supplement in poultry feed can provide an interesting source of organic Se, thereby offering health-related advantages to humans. In this study, bacterial selenoproteins from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was used as a dietary supplement with other Se sources in Lohman brown Classic laying hens to study the egg yolk color, egg yolk and breast antioxidant profile, oxidative stability, and storage effect for fresh and stored egg yolk at 4 +/- 2 degrees C for 14-days. The results showed that dietary Se supplementation significantly (p < 0.05) improved egg yolk color, the antioxidant profile of egg yolk, and breast meat (total carotenoid and phenol content). When the Se treated groups were compared to control groups, there was a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in total cholesterol in fresh and stored egg yolk and breast muscle.

Effects of two chemical fertilizers (triple superphosphate (TSP) and urea) and three bio-fertilizers (Bradyrhizobium japonicum, Pseudomonas putida and mycorrhizal fungi) compared to control were studied on resistance of cowpea pod and grain to C. maculatus. Pod resistance was evaluated as oviposition preference, egg-to-adult survival and developmental time, and grain resistance was measured as life history and life table parameters of the pest. Cowpea plants treated with tested fertilizers were grown under field condition. Then, the full-size green pods and their immature grains were harvested and used in the experiments. The highest oviposition preference and percentage of adults emergence were on control (untreated) pods as compared to treated ones. The longest developmental times were recorded on the pods obtained from TSP and B. japonicum treatments. In most cases, significant differences were observed for the life history and life table parameters of C. maculatus on the grains treated with examined fertilizers. Delayed developmental time was recorded when C. maculatus was fed with P. putida- and B. japonicum-treated grains. The highest and lowest number of eggs laid by each female (fecundity) was on the grains obtained from TSP and control treatments, respectively. The net reproductive rate (R-0), intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) and finite rate of increase (lambda) were the lowest on cowpea grains fertilized with B. japonicum and highest on the grains treated with urea.

Here, we measured the functional traits and leaf reflectance spectrum of the host plants under different disease degrees. The findings provide a fast and efficient method for large-scale and high-precision monitoring of C. gloeosporioides in M. persiciforma stands. Using the collected leaf reflection data, we set up a prediction model of the optimal disease degree. Firstly, we found that leaf functional traits of M. persiciforma generally consisted of low leaf thickness, low relative chlorophyll content, small specific leaf area, high leaf tissue density, high dry matter content, low stomatal density, and large stomatal area. Secondly, leaf reflectivity increases with damage of C. gloeosporioides, which corresponds to five main reflection peaks and five absorption valleys in the spectral reflectance curve of leaves at the same positions (350-1800 nm). Thirdly, with the increase of infection degree, red edge slope and yellow edge slope decrease, while green peak reflectance, red valley reflectance, and blue edge slope all increase. Blue shift was detected in the red edge, green peak, and red valley, while red shift appeared at the blue edge and yellow edge. Finally, the best predictive model was that based on green peak reflectance (y=3.6396-0.0693x, R-2=0.5149, RMSE [root-mean-square error] =0.2735), with an R-2=0.92 and RMSE=0.0042 between its predicted vs. observed values.

We determined that the successful root colonization of L. monocytogenes 10403S was modestly but significantly enhanced by the bacterium being pregrown at higher temperatures, and this effect was independent of the biofilm and virulence regulator PrfA. We tested 14 rhizosphere-derived bacteria for their impact on L. monocytogenes 10403S, identifying one that enhanced and 10 that inhibited the association of 10403S with plant roots.

We simulated climate warming and top predator loss in natural microcosms to investigate their direct and indirect effects on temporal stability of microbial communities and the role of underlying stabilising mechanisms. Community stability was insensitive to warming, but indirectly decreased due to top predator loss via increased mesopredator abundance and consequent reduction of species asynchrony and species stability.

Here, we demonstrate the application of regime shift theory to one of California's newest and deepest reservoirs, Diamond Valley Lake (DVL), which in recent years showed an unexpected rapid departure from its water quality conditions of the previous decade. The reservoir shifted from a well oxygenated condition with low phytoplankton growth to a hypoxic, phytoplankton-dominated turbid system. We statistically identified the critical stressor (phosphorus (P)), switch points, and its load threshold and characterized its transition to an alternative stable state and the stabilizing mechanisms contributing to hysteresis. We analyzed long-term environmental, chemical and flow data, conducted a hydrographic survey, and developed a hydrodynamic model to characterize the factors that contributed to regime shift and to evaluate different management strategies that might reverse this shift. Our findings indicate that large deep systems exhibit different transition dynamics in the presence of an acute stressor compared to regime shifts in shallow systems. A cumulative external TP load threshold of 4.6 mg m(-2) d(-1) added to the reservoir over nearly 11 months was identified as the critical stressor. For large deep systems, inherent morphometric features such as large relative depth combine with external stressors to drive regime shifts. Light winds, morphometric conditions impeding deep mixing, and a stable stratification that lasts up to 9 months makes DVL more susceptible to hypolimnetic hypoxia, an intrinsic factor accelerating regime shift. Results also suggest regime shift occurred in 2013, when new limnological processes were established to reinforce the new alternative stable state and existing ecosystem services were impaired. Interactions between hypoxia, internal P loading (similar to 2.1 mg m(-2) d(-1)), and seasonal cyanobacterial blooms were identified as mechanisms perpetuating the new alternative state.

An ultimate consequence of warming would be a transition to a different mixing regime. Here we investigate the role of physical, chemical, and biological feedback mechanisms that unfold during a shift in mixing regime, and whether these feedbacks could prompt and stabilise the new regime. Although climate, interannual temperature variation, and lake morphometry are the main determinants of a mixing regime, when climate change causes shifts in mixing regime, internal feedback mechanisms may gain in importance and modify lake ecosystem functioning. We review the role of these feedbacks in three mixing regime shifts: from polymictic to seasonally stratified, from dimictic to monomictic, and from holomictic to oligomictic or meromictic. Polymictic lakes of intermediate depth (c. 3-10 m mean depth) could experience seasonal stratification if a stratification event triggers phytoplankton blooms or dissolved organic matter release, reducing transparency and therefore further heating the surface layer. However, this feedback is only likely to have influence in small and clear lakes, it would be easily disturbed by weather conditions, and the resulting stratified state does not remain stable in the long term, as stratification is lost in winter. The ice-albedo feedback might cause an accelerated shift from ice-covered (dimictic) to ice-free (monomictic) winters in sufficiently deep (mean depth 50 m or more) lakes, where temperature memory is carried over from one winter to the next. Nevertheless, there is an ongoing debate into whether this process can persist during natural weather variations and overcome self-stabilising mechanisms such as thermal insulation by snow. The majority of studies suggest that a gradual transition from dimictic to monomictic is more likely than an abrupt transition. A shift from a holomictic to a meromictic regime can occur if anoxia is triggered by incomplete mixing and an increase in deep-water density-through the accumulation of solutes-exceeds a density decrease by hypolimnetic warming. A shift to meromixis would strongly alter the biology of a lake and might be difficult to reverse. If solutes accumulate only minimally in the hypolimnion, an oligomictic regime is formed, in which years with complete and incomplete mixing alternate. Understanding the importance of feedback mechanisms and the role of biogeochemistry when lakes shift in mixing regime could lead to a better understanding of how climate change affects lake ecosystems.","2021","MAR 2021","10.1111/fwb.13704","WOS:000633506600001"

Here, we test whether phylogenetic information can predict the biogeographical distributions, community assembly and species co-occurrence of soil archaea. Location Northern China. Time period July and August 2017. Major taxa studied Archaeal communities. Methods By conducting a large-scale (transect intervals of 1,257.6 km) study across agricultural field, forest, wetland, grassland and desert biomes, we applied the phylogenetic framework of niche conservatism to investigate archaeal biogeography, community assembly and network topology. We examined the phylogenetic signal based on Blomberg's K to test whether the environmental preference of a given archaeal taxon was related to the phylogeny, corresponding to the degree of phylogenetic conservatism for environmental niches across complex environmental gradients. We evaluated the assembly processes of archaeal communities based on null model and Sloan neutral model analyses. We then explored the major factors that influenced the species coexistence and assembly processes of soil archaeal communities. Results Soil archaeal taxa exhibited strong climate-related niche conservatism of ecological preferences. Mean annual precipitation (MAP) had the strongest phylogenetic signal, and this mediated both community assembly processes and species coexistence, with stronger deterministic assembly and less species coexistence in environments with lower precipitation. Phylogenetic diversity was closely linked to the balance of community assembly processes; that is, stochastic assembly processes were dominant in low-diversity communities, whereas variable selection of deterministic processes promoted high phylogenetic diversity. Main conclusions We conclude that strong phylogenetic niche conservatism of soil archaea drives their biogeographical distributions. Our findings represent a considerable advance in linking phylogenetic niche conservatism to soil archaeal biogeography, community assembly and species coexistence, and therefore forecasting soil archaeal evolutionary adaptations in response to ongoing environmental changes.","2021","MAY 2021","10.1111/geb.13313","WOS:000651785300001"

However, changes in food webs and energy flow in complex fish communities after zebra mussel establishment are poorly known. We assessed impacts of zebra mussels on fish littoral carbon use, trophic position, isotopic niche size, and isotopic niche overlap among individual fish species using delta C-13 and delta N-15 data collected before (2014) and after (2019) zebra mussel establishment in Lake Ida, MN. Isotope data were collected from 11 fish species, and from zooplankton and littoral invertebrates to estimate baseline isotope values. Mixing models were used to convert fish delta C-13 and delta N-15 into estimates of littoral carbon and trophic position, respectively. We tested whether trophic position, littoral carbon use, isotopic niche size, and isotopic niche overlap changed from 2014 to 2019 for each fish species. We found few effects on fish trophic position, but 10 out of 11 fish species increased littoral carbon use after zebra mussel establishment, with mean littoral carbon increasing from 43% before to 67% after establishment. Average isotopic niche size of individual species increased significantly (2.1-fold) post zebra mussels, and pairwise-niche overlap between species increased significantly (1.2-fold). These results indicate zebra mussels increase littoral energy dependence in the fish community, resulting in larger individual isotopic niches and increased isotopic niche overlap. These effects may increase interspecific competition among fish species and could ultimately result in reduced abundance of species less able to utilize littoral energy sources.","2021","APR 2021","10.1007/s10530-021-02553-0","WOS:000646091000001"

Recent advances in ecological coexistence theory offer a powerful framework to probe the mechanisms regulating intra- and interspecific competition, but the significance of this body of theory to the problem of antibiotic resistance has been largely overlooked. In this Perspective, we draw on emerging ecological theory to illustrate how changes in resource niche overlap can be equally important as changes in competitive ability for understanding costs of resistance and the persistence of resistant pathogens in microbial communities. We then show how different temporal patterns of resource and antibiotic supply, alongside trade-offs in competitive ability at high and low resource concentrations, can have diametrically opposing consequences for the coexistence and exclusion of resistant and susceptible strains. These insights highlight numerous opportunities for innovative experimental and theoretical research into the ecological dimensions of antibiotic resistance.","2021","FEB 2021","10.1038/s41559-020-01385-w","WOS:000613622000002"

Despite the key role of archaea in soil biogeochemical cycles, the assembly processes and co-occurrence patterns of archaeal communities in coastal wetlands in response to increasing inundation frequencies remain elusive. In this study, we established an in situ mesocosm with an inundation frequency gradient to investigate the response of soil archaeal community toward increasing inundation frequencies in monocultures of Spartina alterniflora and a mangrove species, Kandelia obovata. Both neutral community model and null model analyses suggested that stochastic processes are dominant in governing the archaeal community assembly and that the stochastic processes are enhanced with increasing inundation frequencies. Increasing inundation frequencies significantly increased the community niche width. Moreover, archaeal community in S. alterniflora soil displayed lower niche overlap and higher stochasticity than in K. obovata soil. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that the network complexity increases with increase in the inundation frequencies. Soil water content is the most decisive factor influencing the archaeal communities. Overall, we found that increasing inundation frequencies enhance the stochastic processes and network complexity of the soil archaeal community in coastal wetlands. This study could enhance our understanding on the response of soil archaeal communities in coastal wetlands toward global change. IMPORTANCE Coastal wetlands, subjected to regular disturbances by periodic tides, are highly productive and important in the regulation of climate change. However, the assembly mechanisms and co-occurrence patterns of soil archaeal communities in coastal areas remain poorly known, especially for their responses to increasing inundation frequencies. In this study, we aimed at unraveling these uncertainties by studying typical estuarine ecosystems in southern China. We show that increasing inundation frequencies enhance the stochastic processes and network complexity of the soil archaeal community. This study offers a new path for an improved understanding of archaeal community assembly and species coexistence in coastal environments, with a special focus on the role of inundation frequency.","2021",NA,"10.1128/AEM.02560-20","WOS:000655912400022"

Previous work has demonstrated that the pH in the nasal passage experiences temporal fluctuations. Yet, the impact of such pH fluctuations on nasal microbiota is not fully understood. Here, we examine how temporal fluctuations in pH might affect the coexistence of nasal bacteria in in silico communities. We take advantage of the cultivability of nasal bacteria to experimentally assess their responses to pH and the presence of other species. Based on experimentally observed responses, we formulate a mathematical model to numerically investigate the impact of temporal pH fluctuations on species coexistence. We assemble in silico nasal communities using up to 20 strains that resemble the isolates that we have experimentally characterized. We then subject these in silico communities to pH fluctuations and assess how the community composition and coexistence is impacted. Using this model, we then simulate pH fluctuations-varying in amplitude or frequency-to identify conditions that best support species coexistence. We find that the composition of nasal communities is generally robust against pH fluctuations within the expected range of amplitudes and frequencies. Our results also show that cooperative communities and communities with lower niche overlap have significantly lower composition deviations when exposed to temporal pH fluctuations.

Greater spatial overlap (SO) between species due to water column mixing could thus promote competitive exclusion, reducing community taxonomic diversity. However, greater SO could also promote coexistence of functionally different taxa. Using data from a whole-lake experiment, we investigated the effects of SO and other relevant environmental factors on phytoplankton diversity across the water columns of lake basins with different thermocline manipulations. We estimated SO using an in situ fluorometer, and overall community diversity microscopically. Using structured equation models, we estimated directional relationships between phytoplankton diversity, SO, the lake physical structure and the zooplankton community. No significant effect of SO on phytoplankton taxonomic diversity was observed, but higher SO was associated with greater functional diversity. Change in lake physical structure and in the zooplankton community also affected diversity, with a negative response to increased top-down interactions. Overall, despite the fact that the alteration of water column stratification structure and top-down interactions were stronger drivers of phytoplankton diversity in our system, some effect of spatial overlap on the outcome of inferred competitive interactions were observable.","2021",NA,"10.3390/microorganisms9122447","WOS:000735578800001"

Two oligotrophic lakes in West Greenland with different dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were selected. We assessed which factors: (1) promote under-ice growth of phytoplankton, and (2) trigger shifts in the community structure. Our results suggest that DOC is an important driver of the seasonal distribution of phytoplankton biomass-high DOC exacerbates light limitation under ice resulting in low phytoplankton biomass, but supports phytoplankton growth during the open-water period when photolytic and biological degradation of organic matter contributes to the pool of available nutrients. Under-ice phytoplankton biomass in a clear, low DOC lake was as high as during the open-water period, suggesting the importance of under-ice processes for lake metabolic balance, also evidenced by persistent oxic conditions in the hypolimnion. Species composition was dynamic, reflecting rapidly changing conditions over the course of the season. Our data suggest that phytoplankton under ice provides seed populations for early spring blooms and that the largest shifts in species composition occur later during the summer, likely as a result of nutrient depletion and intensified grazing pressure. Early spring temperatures in West Greenland have risen rapidly in recent decades, triggering shifts in the timing of lake ice-out and the onset of stratification; therefore, it is important to understand phytoplankton seasonal dynamics to disentangle the effects of climate-driven shifts on aquatic biota.","2021",NA,"10.1029/2020JG005972","WOS:000645001600033"

The objective of this work was to study the competitiveness of three potential biocontrol candidates (Debaryomyces hansenii FHSCC 253H, Enterococcus faecium SE920 and Penicillium chrysogenum CECT, 20922) against the ochratoxigenic P. nordicum FHSCC4 under environmental and nutritional conditions simulating the ripening of dry-cured meat products. For this, the nutritional utilisation pattern, niche overlap index (NOI), interactions by dual-culture assays and OTA production were determined. The number of carbon sources (CSs) metabolised depended on the microorganism and the interacting water activity (aw) x temperature conditions. The number of CSs utilised by both filamentous fungi was quite similar and higher than those utilised by D. hansenii and E. faecium. The yeast isolate metabolised a number of CSs much larger than the bacterium. The NOI values showed that, in general, P. nordicum nutritionally dominated E. faecium and D. hansenii regardless of the environmental conditions evaluated. The relationship between the toxigenic and non-toxigenic fungal isolates depended on the aw x temperature combinations, although in none of the conditions a dominance of P. nordicum was observed. According to the interaction assays, both D. hansenii and P. chrysogenum decreased the growth of P. nordicum. The effect of D. hansenii could be attributed to the production of some extra-cellular compounds, while the action of P. chrysogenum is likely related to nutritional competition. In addition, both P. chrysogenum and D. hansenii reduced the OTA levels produced by P. nordicum. The effect of the yeast was more pronounced decreasing the concentration of OTA at quantities lower than the limit established by the Italian legislation. Therefore, P. chrysogenum and D. hansenii can be suggested as biocontrol candidates in the manufacture of dry-cured meat products. (C) 2020 British Mycological Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we investigated differences in protist communities using high-throughput sequencing and their inferred potential interactions with bacteria and fungi between the bulk soil and rhizosphere compartments of three soybean cultivars collected from six ecological regions in China. Distinct protist community structures characterized the bulk soil and rhizosphere of soybean plants. A significantly higher relative abundance of phagotrophs was observed in the rhizosphere (25.1%) than in the bulk soil (11.3%). Spatial location (R-2 = 0.37-0.51) explained more of the variation in protist community structures of soybean fields than either the compartment (R-2 = 0.08-0.09) or cultivar type (R-2 = 0.02-0.03). The rhizosphere protist network (76 nodes and 414 edges) was smaller and less complex than the bulk soil network (147 nodes and 880 edges), indicating a smaller potential of niche overlap and interactions in the rhizosphere due to the increased resources in the rhizosphere.

To achieve this goal, we developed original procedures coupling niche theory and habitat suitability modelling using abundance data in 4 consecutive steps: (1) estimate the realised niche applying kernel functions, (2) assess differences between the species' niches as a whole and at the local level, (3) develop habitat and temporal suitability models using niche overlap procedures and (4) explore species temporal and spatial distributions to highlight possible drivers. We used data on species abundance and environmental variables collected over 27 yr (1988-2014), including 139 coastal water sampling sites along the French Atlantic coast. Results showed that the niches occupied by A. minutum and P. australis are very different, although both species exhibit a preference for warmer months.

Using bulk delta C-13 and delta N-15 of organisms and potential food sources, we elucidated dietary sources and found that invertebrate communities exhibited resource partitioning and contained two main food chains (periphyton versus terrestrial organic matter [OM]). In both spring complexes, several endemic spring orifice associated and subterranean taxa derived most of their diet from terrestrial OM. Analysis of compound-specific stable isotopes (i.e., delta C-13 of essential amino acids, EAAs) from two co-occurring elmid species indicated that the endemic spring orifice-associated species (Heterelmis comalensis) derived > 80% of its EAAs from bacteria, whereas the widespread surface species (Microcylloepus pusillus) derived its EAAs from a more equitable mix of bacteria, fungi, and algae. We additionally calculated niche overlap among of several taxonomically related groups (aquatic beetles and amphipods) that co-occur in spring ecotones and posterior probability estimates indicated little to no niche overlap among related species. Results indicate that invertebrates at subterranean-surface aquatic ecotones are partitioning food resources and highlight the importance of connections to riparian zones for persistence of several endemic invertebrates.","2021","APR 2021","10.1007/s00442-021-04912-z","WOS:000637632000001"

Seeds of T. fragiferum and T. repens were collected from populations in the wild, and plants were cultivated in an automated greenhouse, two plants per container. Three basic types of planting were performed: (1) both plants were T. fragiferum (single species), (2) one T. fragiferum and one T. repens (species coexistence), (3) both plants were T. repens (single species). For every basic type, three subtypes were made: (1) non-inoculated, (2) inoculated with rhizobia taken from T. fargiferum, (3) inoculated with rhizobia taken from T. repens. For every subtype, half of the containers were used as control, and half were treated with NaCl. Shoot fresh mass of plants was significantly (p < 0.001) affected by species coexistence, inoculant, and NaCl. Three significant two-way interactions on plant shoot growth were found: between species coexistence and NaCl (p < 0.001), inoculant and species (p < 0.05), and NaCl and species (p < 0.001). A significant three-way interaction between inoculant, NaCl, and species (p < 0.001) indicated different responses of shoot growth of the two species to inoculant type and NaCl. NaCl treatment was an important factor for T. fragiferum, resulting in better growth in conditions of species coexistence, but the positive effect of bacterial inoculant was significantly more pronounced. A decrease in peroxidase activity in leaves was a good indicator of relative NaCl tolerance, while the absence/presence of rhizobial inoculation was reflected by changes in leaf chlorophyll concentration and photochemical activity of photosystem II. It can be concluded that interaction between biotic and abiotic factors affected the outcome of the coexistence of the two Trifolium species.

In this study, we investigated the responses of taxonomic and functional structure of rotifer communities to total phosphorus (TP) concentration in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), China.

Body size is a fundamental trait that impacts many aspects of species biology and ecology. It is, in turn, influenced by a suite of environmental factors, and often decreases with warming. Although environmental conditions can also impact body shape, which is another functional trait that influences locomotion, resource acquisition and potentially physiological processes, such responses are poorly understood and rarely quantified. 2. We experimentally tested the independent and combined effects of environmental temperature, resource level and interspecific competition on the body shape and size responses of two model protist species. We also tested the degree to which these individual--level phenotypic responses are associated with population densities and species coexistence. 3. Body shape was strongly influenced by resource competition, whereas body size changes were mainly driven by environmental temperature. In both species, lower resource levels resulted in body shape elongation, suggesting that relatively more elongate individuals with potentially higher swimming speed were advantaged in the resource scarce environment. However, competition had contrasting influence on the body shape of the two species. Competition decreased the population densities of Blepharisma japonicum, which exhibited relative body shape elongation, similar to the response at low resource levels. In contrast, competition increased the population densities of Paramecium aurelia, which exhibited reduced elongation similar to body shape response at high resource levels. Hence, body shape responses could be indicative of changes in resource availability, aiding our understanding of competitive hierarchies and species interactions. 4. Coexistence was observed in all treatment combinations, likely because body size of both species decreased similarly under warming, potentially maintaining constant per capita competitive intensity. These findings, along with recent research on phytoplankton, diverse pelagic invertebrates, and birds highlight the importance of body shape and morphology across different taxonomic groups. Hence, we call for body size and shape to be considered in concert when investigating ecological consequences of climate warming.","2021","MAY 2021","10.1111/1365-2435.13789","WOS:000651894000001"

There are four cpn60 sequence-based subgroups within the genus (A, B, C and D), and thirteen genome species have been defined recently. Gardnerella spp. co-occur in the vaginal microbiome with varying abundance, and these patterns are shaped by a resource-dependent, exploitative competition, which affects the growth rate of subgroups A, B and C negatively. The growth rate of rarely abundant subgroup D, however, increases with the increasing number of competitors, negatively affecting the growth rate of others. We hypothesized that a nutritional generalist lifestyle and minimal niche overlap with the other more abundant Gardnerella spp. facilitate the maintenance of subgroup D in the vaginal microbiome through negative frequency-dependent selection. Using 40 whole-genome sequences from isolates representing all four subgroups, we found that they could be distinguished based on the content of their predicted proteomes. Proteins associated with carbohydrate and amino acid uptake and metabolism were significant contributors to the separation of subgroups. Subgroup D isolates had significantly more of their proteins assigned to amino acid metabolism than the other subgroups. Subgroup D isolates were also significantly different from others in terms of number and type of carbon sources utilized in a phenotypic assay, while the other three could not be distinguished. Overall, the results suggest that a generalist lifestyle and lack of niche overlap with other Gardnerella spp. leads to subgroup D being favoured by negative frequency-dependent selection in the vaginal microbiome.","2021","NOV 2020","10.1007/s00248-020-01643-1","WOS:000591107300001"

All bloodmeal analyses were completed in engorged females collected by means of BG-GAT (BIOGENTS (R)) traps and blood identification was made through PCR analysis using cytochrome b as reference gene. The results show thatAe. aegyptiis feeding primarily on birds from the Galliformes and Columbiformes orders. On the other hand,Culex quinquefasciatusexhibits the same behavior asAe. aegypti, selecting Galliformes as the main blood source group but exhibits different behavior regarding humans, feeding preferentially on humans over non-human mammals. Regarding resource utilization,Ae. aegyptihad a broader niche (0.79) thanCx. quinquefasciatus(0.46). Pianka ' s niche overlap index (0.79) showed that both species share many common hosts. Host selection for the mosquito species analyzed were found to be atypical from what is reported in the literature, which could have an impact on the vectorial capacity of the mosquitoes within the study area.","2021","JUN 2020","10.1007/s42690-020-00175-y","WOS:000539281500002"

Therefore, this study compared the differences of plant species and phylogenetic alpha-and beta-diversity between grazing and fencing conditions at three alpine grasslands (ASMWG: alpine steppe meadow for winter grazing; ASMSG: alpine steppe meadow for summer grazing; AMSG: alpine meadow for summer grazing), Northern Tibet. At the ASMSG site, grazing significantly decreased mean nearest taxon distance (MNTD) by 19.33%, and increased Pielou by 7.06%. Plant community compositions between fencing and grazing conditions were different (p = 0.021) at the ASMSG site. However, the Pielou, MNTD and plant community composition were not significantly different between the fencing and grazing conditions at the ASMWG and AMSG site. Grazing significantly increased the niche overlap at the ASMWG (levins: 51.36%, schooner: 28.97%, pianka: 28.11%, Czech: 28.97%; morisita: 28.75%) and ASMSG site (schooner: 35.19%, petraitis: 4.63%, pianka: 26.45%, czech: 35.19%; morisita: 30.86%), indicating that grazing may increase plant species competition and competitive exclusion at the ASMWG and ASMSG site. In contrast, grazing did not significantly affect niche overlap at the AMSG site. Therefore, the response of plant diversity to grazing can be different between species and phylogenetic diversity, and among alpine grasslands.","2021","JUN 2021","10.1016/j.ecoleng.2021.106331","WOS:000685533300009"

Little is known about microbial distribution and community assembly in AMD lakes, especially in deep layers. Here, we investigated prokaryotic microbial diversity and community assembly along a depth profile in a stratified AMD lake using 16S rRNA gene sequencing combined with multivariate ecological and statistical methods. The water column in the AMD lake exhibited tight geochemical gradients, with more acidic surface water. Coupled with vertical hydrochemical variations, prokaryotic microbial community structure changed significantly, and was accompanied by increased diversity with depth. In the surface water, heterogeneous selection was the most important assembly process, whereas stochastic processes gained importance with depth. Meanwhile, microbial co-occurrences, especially positive interactions, were more frequent in the stressful surface water with reduced network modularity and keystone taxa. The pH was identified as the key driver of microbial diversity and community assembly along the vertical profile based on random forest analysis. Taken together, environmental effects dominated by acid stress drove the community assembly and species coexistence that underpinned the spatial scaling patterns of AMD microbiota in the lake. These findings demonstrate the distinct heterogeneity of local prokaryotic microbial community in AMD lake, and provide new insights into the mechanism to maintain microbial diversity in extreme acidic environments.","2021","OCT 2021","10.1016/j.watres.2021.117739","WOS:000713308000003"

The coexistence of sympatric zooplanktivorous fish species might therefore be exposed in part to trophic niche overlap and competition for food. Combining visual diet characterization under the microscope with DNA metabarcoding from stomach contents of fish collected in spring results show that predation on relatively large krill is equally important for sardinella than for the other two niche overlapping species. Furthermore, an important overlap is found in their isotopic niche, especially with anchovy, using nitrogen (delta N-15) and carbon (delta C-13) stable isotopes in muscle tissue. In fact, the three fish species are able to feed effectively in the whole prey size spectrum available during the sampled season, from the smallest diatoms and copepods to the larger prey (i.e., decapods and euphausiids), including fish larvae. Moreover, effective predation upon other large prey like siphonophores, which is observed only when multi-proxy analyses in stomach contents are applied, might also be relevant in the diet of sardinella. The overlapping diet composition in spring, together with the effective use of food resource by sardinella, can be of special interest in potential future scenarios with warmer water temperature leading to lower zooplankton and/or higher jellyfish availability, where sardinella may take advantage over other species due to its feeding plasticity.","2021","NOV 2021","10.1002/ece3.8293","WOS:000716326700001"

A fundamental question in community ecology is the role of predator-prey interactions in food-web stability and species coexistence. Although microbial microcosms offer powerful systems to investigate it, interrogating the environment is much more arduous. Here, we show in a 1-year survey that the obligate predators Bdellovibrio and like organisms (BALOs) can regulate prey populations, possibly in a density-dependent manner, in the naturally complex, species-rich environments of wastewater treatment plants. Abundant as well as rarer prey populations are affected, leading to an oscillating predatory landscape shifting at various temporal scales in which the total population remains stable. Shifts, along with differential prey range, explain co-existence of the numerous predators through niche partitioning. We validate these sequence-based findings using single-cell sorting combined with fluorescent hybridization and community sequencing.

However, measuring this competition between putative biocontrol agents and pathogens for the same resources remains difficult. To evaluate carbon and nitrogen source utilization as a measure of competitiveness, we used phenotype microarrays on three endophytes (Trichoderma atroviridae, Trichoderma harzianum and Lecanicillium lecanii) with reported biological control activity and five stem-infecting fungal pathogens (Diplodia seriata, Eutypa lata, Neofusicoccum parvum, Phaeomoniella chlamydospora, and Phaeoacremonium minimum) that infect grapevine and other important woody plant hosts. The faster growing N. parvum and D. seriata utilized a greater number of the 190 assessed carbon and 380 assessed nitrogen sources than the relatively slower growing pathogens E. lata, P. chlamydospora, and P. minimum. All three endophytes had a greater niche overlap of carbon and nitrogen resource use than E. lata and P. chlamydospora. However, only T. harzianum and L. lecanii were determined to be able to equally compete or slightly outcompete N. parvum and D. seriata over carbon or nitrogen sources. Therefore, based on these results involving carbon and nitrogen source niche utilization, T. harzianum and L. lecanii would be advanced to additional biological control agent screening. Furthermore, according to plate bioassays, both Trichoderma spp. exhibited significant growth reduction of all pathogens except P. minimum, and L. lecanii significant reduced growth of D. seriata, E. lata, and N. parvum. Therefore, a combination of direct antagonism and ability to outcompete over resources is important in selecting biocontrols. Regardless, these results demonstrated the capacity of phenotype microarrays to assess the ability of endophytes to outcompete pathogens over shared resources in in vitro conditions as a complement to traditional plate assays.","2021","MAY 2021","10.1007/s10526-021-10091-w","WOS:000651662900001"

Here, we studied the pairwise effects of actinobacteria on other microbes isolated from red soils under different nutritional conditions. We found that neutral effects dominated the interactions, accounting for 68.1% of the interactions in eutrophic conditions and for a significantly higher proportion (86.2%) in oligotrophic conditions. High nutrient levels boosted active metabolism of actinobacteria and generally made them more aggressive, supporting the stress gradient hypothesis. The secondary metabolites produced by actinobacteria played a pivotal role in interference competition with other microbes, of which the role of desferrioxamine siderophores could not be ignored. Niche overlap seemed to be another cause of competition, notably under oligotrophic conditions. Moreover, the large-scale phylogeny had a much greater impact on the interaction than the location origin of the microbes.

"Zaret, MM; Bauer, JT; Clay, K; Whitaker, BK","Conspecific leaf litter induces negative feedbacks in Asteraceae seedlings","ECOLOGY","The plant soil feedback (PSF) framework has been instrumental in understanding the impacts of soil microbes on plant fitness and species coexistence. PSFs develop when soil microbial communities are altered due to the identity and density of a particular plant species, which can then enhance or inhibit the local survival and growth of that plant species as well as different plant species. The recent extension of the PSF framework to aboveground microbiota, termed here as plant phyllosphere feedbacks (PPFs), can also help to determine the impact of aboveground microbes on plant fitness and species interactions. However, experimental tests of PPFs during early plant growth are nascent and the prevalence of PPFs across diverse plant species remains unknown. Additionally, it is unclear whether plant host characteristics, such as functional traits or phylogenetic distance, may help to predict the strength and direction of PPFs. To test for the prevalence of litter-mediated PPFs, recently senesced plant litter from 10 native Asteraceae species spanning a range of life history strategies was used to inoculate seedlings of both conspecific and heterospecific species. We found that exposure to conspecific litter significantly reduced the growth of four species relative to exposure to heterospecific litter (i.e., significant negative PPFs), three species experienced marginally significant negative PPFs, and the PPF estimates for all 10 species were negative. However, neither plant functional traits, nor phylogenetic distance were predictive of litter feedbacks across plant species pairs, suggesting that other mechanisms or traits not measured may be driving conspecific negative PPFs. Our results indicate that negative, litter-mediated PPFs are common among native Asteraceae species and that they may have substantial impacts on plant growth and plant species interactions, particularly during early plant growth.","2021","NOV 2021","10.1002/ecy.3557","WOS:000714502400001"

Compatible species combinations are conducive to reconstruct plant communities that can persist at a low cost without further management and even develop into natural forest communities. However, our understanding of how the compatibility of mycorrhizal types mediates species coexistence is still limited, especially in a novel agroforestry system. Here, we assessed the effects of mycorrhizal association type on the survival and growth of native woody species in mixed-species Eucalyptus plantations. To uncover how mycorrhizal type regulates plant-soil feedbacks, we first conducted a pot experiments by treating distinct mycorrhizal plants with soil microbes from their own or other mycorrhizal types. We then compared the growth response of arbuscular mycorrhizal plants and ectomycorrhizal plants to different soil microbial compositions associated with Eucalyptus plants. We found that the type of mycorrhizal association had a significant impact on the survival and growth of native tree species in the Eucalyptus plantations. The strength and direction of the plant-soil feedbacks of focal tree species depended on mycorrhizal type. Non-mycorrhizal plants had consistent negative feedbacks with the highest survival in the Eucalyptus plantations, whereas nitrogen-fixing plants had consistent positive feedbacks and the lowest survival. Arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal plants performed varied feedback responses to soil microbes from distinct mycorrhizal plant species. Non-mycorrhizal plants grew better with Eucalyptus soil microbes while nitrogen-fixing plants grew worse with their own conspecific soil microbes. Different soil microbial compositions of Eucalyptus consistently increased the aboveground growth of arbuscular mycorrhizal plants, but the non-mycorrhizal microbial composition of the Eucalyptus soil resulted in greater belowground growth of ectomycorrhizal plants. Overall, Eucalyptus plants induced an unfavorable soil community, impeding coexistence with other mycorrhizal plants. Our study provides consistent observational and experimental evidence that mycorrhizal-mediated plant-microbial feedback on species coexistence among woody species. These findings are with important implications to optimize the species combinations for better design of mixed forest plantations.","2021",NA,"10.3389/fpls.2021.616726","WOS:000621787700001"
"Dalziel, BD; Novak, M; Watson, JR; Ellner, SP","Collective behaviour can stabilize ecosystems","NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION","Collective behaviour is common in bacteria, plants and animals, and therefore occurs across ecosystems, from biofilms to cities. With collective behaviour, social interactions among individuals propagate to affect the behaviour of groups, whereas group-level responses in turn affect individual behaviour. These cross-scale feedback loops between individuals, populations and their environments can provide fitness benefits, such as the efficient exploitation of uncertain resources, as well as costs, such as increased resource competition. Although the social mechanics of collective behaviour are increasingly well-studied, its role in ecosystems remains poorly understood. Here we introduce collective movement into a model of consumer-resource dynamics to demonstrate that collective behaviour can attenuate consumer-resource cycles and promote species coexistence. We focus on collective movement as a particularly well-understood example of collective behaviour. Adding collective movement to canonical unstable ecological scenarios causes emergent social-ecological feedback, which mitigates conditions that would otherwise result in extinction. Collective behaviour could play a key part in the maintenance of biodiversity. Collective movements such as flocking or schooling can benefit a single species, but there may also be wider implications of such behaviour. The authors use a theoretical model to show that collective movement of consumer species can promote species coexistence and ecosystem stability.","2021","AUG 2021","10.1038/s41559-021-01517-w","WOS:000684457100001"

Among the different components of the soil community, pathogens are considered to be the main drivers of negative PSFs. Despite this, the number of studies that have experimentally quantified the contribution of soil pathogens to PSFs remains considerably low. Here we conducted a greenhouse experiment with oomycete-specific fungicide to quantify the contribution of soil pathogens, and particularly oomycete pathogens, to individual and pairwise PSFs in forest communities. We used as a case study Mediterranean mixed forests dominated by Quercus suber and invaded by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi. The fungicide treatment was crossed with a competition treatment to explore how conspecific neighbors might modify pathogen effects. To place the results of the experiment in a wider context, we also conducted a systematic review of published papers that explicitly used fungicide to explore the role of pathogens in PSF experiments. Our experimental results showed that oomycete pathogens were the main drivers of individual PSFs in the study forests. Oomycete effects varied among tree species according to their susceptibility to P. cinnamomi, driving negative PSFs in the highly susceptible Q. suber but not in the coexistent Olea europaea. Oomycete-driven PSFs were not modified by intraspecific competition. Oomycete pathogens were also major contributors to negative pairwise PSFs assumed to promote species coexistence. Results from the systematic review supported the novelty of our experimental results, since only three studies had previously used oomycete-specific fungicide in a PSF context and none in systems invaded by exotic oomycetes. Overall, our results provide novel evidence of oomycete pathogens (including the exotic P. cinnamomi) as fundamental drivers of negative individual and pairwise PSFs with implications for species coexistence in invaded communities. Although in the short-term invasive pathogens might contribute to species coexistence by causing self-limitation in dominant species, strong inter-specific variation in self-limitation might undermine coexistence in the long-term. Because of the increasing number of exotic oomycetes worldwide, further attention should be given to oomycetes as drivers of PSFs in plant communities.","2021","JUL 2021","10.1002/ecy.3430","WOS:000674188500001"

Thus, fungi are central for the decomposition of dead organic matter such as leaf litter. Despite their ecological importance, our understanding of relationships between fungal species diversity and ecosystem functioning is limited, especially with regard to aquatic habitats. Moreover, fungal interactions with other groups of microorganisms such as bacteria are rarely investigated. This lack of information may be attributed to methodological limitations in tracking the biomass of individual fungal species in communities, impeding a detailed assessment of deviations from the overall performance expected from the sum of individual species' performances, so-called net diversity effects (NDEs). We used fungal species-specific biomolecular tools to target fungal-fungal and fungal-bacterial interactions on submerged leaves using four cosmopolitan aquatic fungal species and a stream microbial community dominated by bacteria. In microcosms, we experimentally manipulated fungal diversity and bacterial absence/presence and assessed functional performances and fungal community composition after 14 d of incubation. Fungal community data were used to evaluate NDEs on leaf colonization. The individual fungal species were functionally distinct and fungal cultures were on average more efficient than the bacterial culture. In absence of bacteria, NDEs correlated with growth rate (negatively) and genetic divergence (positively), but were predominantly negative, suggesting that higher fungal diversity led to a lower colonization success (niche overlap). In both absence and presence of bacteria, the overall functional performances of the communities were largely defined by their composition (i.e., no interactions at the functional level). In the presence of bacteria, NDEs correlated with genetic divergence (positively) and were largely positive, suggesting higher fungal diversity stimulated colonization (niche complementarity). This stimulation may be driven by a bacteria-induced inhibition of fungal growth, alleviating competition among fungi. Resulting feedback loops eventually promote fungal coexistence and synergistic interactions. Nonetheless, overall functional performances are reduced compared to bacteria-free cultures. These findings highlight the necessity to conduct future studies, investigating biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships using artificial systems, without exclusion of key organisms naturally co-occurring in the compartment of interest. Otherwise, study outcomes might not reflect true ecological relationships and ultimately misguide conservation strategies.","2021","SEP 2021","10.1002/ecy.3471","WOS:000697270200001"

Traditional approaches to characterizing these communities rely on DNA sequencing of a ribosomal precursor RNA gene (the internal transcribed spacer region), but directly sequencing the precursor rRNA may provide a more functionally relevant perspective on the potentially active fungal communities. Here, we map ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic soil fungal communities through a mixed hardwood-conifer forest to assess how above- and belowground diversity linkages compare across these differently adapted guilds. Using highly spatially resolved transects (sampled every 2 m) and well-mapped stands of varying host tree diversity, we sought to understand the relative influence of symbiosis versus environment in predicting fungal diversity measures. Canopy species in this forest included two oaks (Quercus agrifolia and Quercus douglasii) and one pine (Pinus sabiniana). At the scale of our study, spatial turnover in rRNA-based communities was much more predictable from measurable environmental attributes than DNA-based communities. And while turnover of ectomycorrhizal fungi and saprotrophs were predictable by the presence and abundance of different canopy species, they both responded strongly to soil nutrient characteristics, namely pH and nitrogen availability, highlighting the niche overlap of these coexisting guilds and the strong influence of aboveground plants on belowground fungal communities.","2021",NA,"10.3389/fevo.2021.641732","WOS:000672149400001"

The experimental design consists of five treatments: control (CNT), compost (CMP), composted biochar (CMB), compost fortified with biochar (CFWB), biochar (BCH). The results showed that CFWB, CMB, and CMP increased fungal diversity indices (Shannon, Sobs, and Chao) at the RS and MS stages respectively, compared to BCH and CNT. Distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA) at genus level indicated that the pH, available nitrogen, and soil organic matter at SS; available phosphorus at RS; Mg, Mn, Fe, and Zn at MS significantly and positively affected the fungi community. Based on the Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and effect size (LEfSe) analysis, the results revealed that only Cystofilobasidiaceae and Guehomyces were the MS biomarkers; and significantly enriched in CFWB.

The understanding of these processes forms part of the new theories of community assembly and species coexistence, and is attracting attention in a context of expanding human impacts. Specifically, new successional studies provide answers to different mechanisms of community assemblage, and aim to define the importance of deterministic or stochastic processes in the succession dynamic. Biotic limits, which depend directly on biodiversity (i.e., species competition), and abiotic filtering, which depends on the environment, become particularly important when they are exceeded, making the succession process more complicated to reach the previous disturbance stage. Plant functional traits (PFTs) are used in secondary succession studies to establish differences between abandonment stages or to compare types of vegetation or flora, and are more closely related to the functioning of plant communities. Dispersal limitation is a PFT considered an important process from a stochastic point of view because it is related to the establishing of plants. Related to it the soil seed bank plays an important role in secondary succession because it is essential for ecosystem functioning. Soil compounds and microbial community are important variables to take into account when studying any succession stage. Chronosequence is the best way to study the whole process at different time scales.

Here we used a natural gradient of adjacent forest patches that were dominated by either AM or EcM trees, or a mixture of both to determine how fungal communities characterized with high-throughput amplicon sequencing change across organic and mineral soil horizons. We found a general shift from saprotrophic to mycorrhizal fungal dominance with increasing soil depth in all forest mycorrhizal types, especially in organic horizons. Vertical changes in soil chemistry, including pH, organic matter, exchangeable cations, and extractable phosphorus, coincided with shifts in fungal community composition. Although fungal communities and soil chemistry differed among adjacent forest mycorrhizal types, variations were stronger within a given soil profile, pointing to the importance of considering horizons when characterizing soil fungal communities.

The plant species, one cluster root-forming (CR) species and four AM species, are native to jarrah forest that grows on nutrient-impoverished soils in south-western Australia. We measured plant growth in microcosms, with and without inoculation with the AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis, and across a gradient of P supply: 0, 9, 27 and 243 mg P per kg of soil. Our data show evidence of plant-plant facilitation at low P supply and competition at high P supply. Growth of the CR species, Hakea undulata, was highest in microcosms with 0P and without AM inoculation. One AM species, Bossiaea aquifolium, also performed better at lower P levels, possibly benefitting from P mobilised by H. undulata. The other three AM species, one strongly obligates, performed better at higher P levels. Data for Acacia celastrifolia suggested it was facultatively mycotropic, and because there was no correlation between AM colonisation and the relative inoculum effect, we suggest positive effects of AM inoculation at 9P might be due to benefits other than P acquisition, such as pathogen defence. Benefit of AM inoculation diminished for three of four mycorrhizal species at the highest P level as we had predicted. The fourth species, Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah), had higher growth in microcosms that were not inoculated with AM, perhaps because the species benefits more from ectomycorrhizas. Synthesis. Our experimental data suggest spatial heterogeneity of soil P, coupled with a diversity of nutrient-acquisition strategies, and plasticity among plant-plant and plant-AM fungi interactions, contributes to plant species coexistence in the nutrient-impoverished jarrah forest.

Algae dominated the volumetric contribution in cryptic juveniles while crustacean dominated the diet in vagile phase. Exoskeleton of other king crabs occurred in 43% of juveniles with crustaceans in their stomach. This fact confirms cannibalistic behavior in the wild in this species, which is consistent with findings in massive laboratory cultures. There was no evidence of isotopic niche shift between cryptic and vagile juvenile phases. Overlapping isotopic niches of different-sized juveniles suggest that they exploit similar food resources. However, vagile individuals occupy a higher trophic position than cryptic individuals, which could suggest a switch in dietary preference, from detritivorous/herbivory within kelp forests to omnivory outside of kelp forests, and an increase in the level of cannibalism in vagile juveniles.","2021",NA,"10.3390/d13110556","WOS:000724003700001"

In this article we assess the potential distribution, tolerance limits and similarity niche of macroalgae epiphytes and hosts from the Cuba marine shelf. Using different methods (BIOCLIM, Gower, Maxent and SVM) we have modelled the niche for each species. The final prediction map of distribution was made using the ensemble prediction technique. The similarity of ENMs was quantified by Schoener D and Hellinger I distance. The predictive power of all models was reasonable, since the values of the area under the curve (AUC) were greater than 0.9. The host macroalgae most closely related to the spatial distribution pattern of potential abundance of epiphytic macroalgae are Stypopodium zonale (Kendall correlation, r2 = 0.886) and Digenea simplex (Kendall correlation, r2 = 0.777). Environmental variables that contributed mostly (30 %) to the ecological niche models were: the average maximum salinity per year (35.5-36 PSU); the average minimum flow velocity per year (0.2 m center dot s- 1) and the average minimum light at ground level per year (10-60 E center dot m- 2 center dot yr- 1). The results show that epiphytic macroalgae and their most common hosts are generalist species (niche width 0.8) with high overlap in their niche (Schoener D > 0.7; Hellinger I distance = I > 0.6).","2021","APR 2021","10.1016/j.aquabot.2021.103395","WOS:000663425100007"

Here, we use stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopes to assess the proportionate contribution of photoautotrophic and heterotrophic sources to seven Hawaiian coral species collected from six locations around the island of O'ahu, HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai. We analyzed the delta C-13 and delta N-15 of coral tissues and their algal endosymbionts, as well as that of dissolved inorganic matter, particulate organic matter, and zooplankton from each site. Estimates of heterotrophic contribution varied among coral species and sites. Bayesian mixing models revealed that heterotrophic sources (particulate organic material and zooplankton) contributed the most to Pocillopora acuta and Montipora patula coral tissues at 49.3% and 48.0%, respectively, and the least to Porites lobata at 28.7%, on average. Estimates of heterotrophic contribution based on the difference between delta C-13 of the host and algal endosymbiont (delta C-13(h-e)) and isotopic niche overlap often differed, while estimates based on delta N-15(h-e) were slightly more aligned with the estimates produced using Bayesian mixing models. These findings suggest that the utility of each approach may vary with coral health status, regions, and coral species. Overall, we find that the mean heterotrophic contribution to Hawaiian coral tissues ranges from 20% to 50%, suggesting a variety of trophic strategies. However, these findings did not always match past direct measurements of heterotrophic feeding, indicating that heterotrophically acquired nutrition does not necessarily get incorporated into tissues but can be respired or exuded in mucus.","2021","MAY 2021","10.1002/lno.11760","WOS:000647452600001"

"Xie, L; Shou, WY","Steering ecological-evolutionary dynamics to improve artificial selection of microbial communities","NATURE COMMUNICATIONS","Microbial communities often perform important functions that depend on inter-species interactions. To improve community function via artificial selection, one can repeatedly grow many communities to allow mutations to arise, and reproduce the highest-functioning communities by partitioning each into multiple offspring communities for the next cycle. Since improvement is often unimpressive in experiments, we study how to design effective selection strategies in silico. Specifically, we simulate community selection to improve a function that requires two species. With a community function landscape, we visualize how community function depends on species and genotype compositions. Due to ecological interactions that promote species coexistence, the evolutionary trajectory of communities is restricted to a path on the landscape. This restriction can generate counter-intuitive evolutionary dynamics, prevent the attainment of maximal function, and importantly, hinder selection by trapping communities in locations of low community function heritability. We devise experimentally-implementable manipulations to shift the path to higher heritability, which speeds up community function improvement even when landscapes are high dimensional or unknown.

Here, we used a 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing approach to investigate the bacterial community diversity in the Eastern Indian Ocean (EIO) during the monsoon and intermonsoon. We employed a phylogenetic null model and network analysis to evaluate the assembly processes and co-occurrence pattern of the microbial community. We found that higher bacterial diversity was detected in the intermonsoon with high temperature and low Chlorophyll a concentrations and N/P ratios. The balance between ecological deterministic processes and stochastic processes varied with seasons in the EIO. Meanwhile, conditionally rare taxa (CRT) were more likely modulated by variable selection processes than always rare taxa (ART) and abundant taxa (AT) (CRT > ART > AT). By linking assembly process and species co-occurrence, we demonstrated that the microbial co-occurrence associations tended to be higher when deterministic processes (mainly variable selection) were weaker. This negative trend was observed in rare species rather than abundant species. The linkage could enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms underpinning the generation and maintenance of microbial community diversity.","2021",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2021.616956","WOS:000688435000001"

Among them, Staphylococcus was the most abundant and widespread functional microbe, and closely related Staphylococcus species were diverse and ubiquitously distributed, with the opportunistic pathogen S. gallinarum being the most abundant Staphylococcus specie isolated from BBP. To explain the dominance status of S. gallinarum and species distributions of Staphylococcus genus, we tested the effects of abiotic and biotic factors on three Staphylococcus species using a tractable BBP model, demonstrating that adaptation to environmental conditions (environmental parameters and other functional microbes) led to the dominant position and species coexistence of Staphylococcus, and congeneric competition among Staphylococcus species further shaped ecological distributions of closely related Staphylococcus species.

We then experimentally manipulated the plots to exclude fungal pathogens, insects, small mammals and large mammals for an additional 31 months to assess the influence of these natural enemies on density-dependent interactions among tropical seedlings.

Results indicated that the species pool (gamma-diversity) showed significant and positive correlations to the observed beta-diversity of the diazotrophic community; that is, diazotrophic community turnover increased with the size of the species pool.

Long-term maintenance of their functional capacities depends strongly on robust autochthonous biotic community baseline data. However, fine-scale temporal patterns remain poorly understood in human-impacted sites, limiting our knowledge of beach response to stressors. Marine arenicolous fungi represent a neglected group of endopsamon microorganisms (living within sandy sediments) that fulfills key ecological roles mainly as saprobes. Preliminary data suggests that this fungal group is threatened by anthropogenic disturbances in tourist beaches, yet knowledge on their ecological plasticity and fine-scale patterns is lacking. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated marine fungal community composition changes over a fine temporal scale (biweekly, over a four-month period) at an impacted Pacific tourist sandy beach, and explored associations between community composition and key environmental variables. We identified 17 taxa, within four ecological groups: strict marine arenicolous fungi (Arenariomyces majusculus, Corollospora gracilis, Corollospora maritima, Corollospora sp. 1 and 2), non-arenicolous marine fungi (Nia sp.), terrestrial borne opportunistic pathogens (Arthrographis kalrae, Parengyodontium album, Neocosmospora solani, Scopulariopsis sp., and Exophiala sp.), and facultative marine species (Aspergillus terreus and Penicillium sp.). In agreement with our hypothesis, minor fine temporal scale changes in community structure suggest arenicolous fungi persist on the beach as inoculum. Nevertheless, we detected changes in the intertidal fungal community structure in response to environmental variables, shown by the increase of terrestrial borne pathogenic species in the rainy season. Lastly, our data warn against extensive beach grooming, which may lead to the direct reduction of strict marine arenicolous fungal groups.","2021",NA,"10.1007/s12526-020-01148-7","WOS:000608368000003"

Empirical investigations show that plant species abundance in the field is often related to plant-soil biota interactions; however, the direction of these relations have yielded inconsistent results. We combined unique 31-year long field data on species abundances from a species-rich mountain meadow with single time point plant-soil feedback greenhouse experiments of 24 co-occurring plant species. We tested whether these relations were dynamic in time, whether coupled increases and decreases in abundance between years were related to plant-soil feedback and whether these changes were underlain by years in which manuring was applied. The prevailingly negative relationship between plant-soil feedback and plant relative abundance in the field was significantly time-dependent, which may reconcile the contrasting results in literature. Furthermore, significantly coupled oscillations appeared between species relative abundance changes and plant-soil feedback, which were likely moderated by years in which manuring was applied. Our results are consistent with the notion that the more abundant species are stabilised by negative plant-soil feedback, and the less abundant species co-vary with the fluctuations of these more competitive species. Synthesis. Our results project plant-soil feedback as an important regulatory mechanism in plant communities, operating in conjunction with species' competitive ability and soil nutrient availability. We suggest that negative feedback is particularly prominent in more abundant plant species that profit from more readily available soil nutrients than less abundant species with positive feedback. Negative plant-soil feedback may thus prevent more abundant plant species from out-competing less abundant plant species, facilitating stable species co-existence.","2021","DEC 2020","10.1111/1365-2745.13574","WOS:000602658900001"

However, in most cases, the role of each member is relatively fixed, and it is rare for the same species to exhibit different symbiotic behaviours throughout its ontogeny. Here, we use stable isotope analyses of food resources to identify the relationships between the spider crab Libinia ferreirae as a symbiont of its jellyfish host during juvenile life stages and as a host for sea anemone epibionts on its carapace as an adult. We ask the following questions: How do the food sources used by the crab change between its juvenile and adult phase? How does the symbiotic relationship change when the crab develops from a juvenile into an adult? We were particularly interested in the extent to which L. ferreirae juveniles feed on jellyfish hosts versus planktonic prey during the juvenile symbiont phase and how adults feed on their epibionts during the freeliving phase. delta 13C of L. ferreirae differed between juvenile (associated with the jellyfish) and adult stages (freeliving), unsurprisingly suggesting that there is little isotopic niche overlap between these life phases. SIMMr models using delta 13C and delta 15N of the crab and its potential food sources indicated that the juvenile crab symbionts did not derive any significant nutrition from medusae and relied predominantly on zooplankton prey. Since juvenile crabs do not have structures to capture zooplankton for feeding, we suggest that they may be kleptoparasites, stealing zooplankton food from their host, though further work is needed to identify the form that such a symbiosis might take. The nutrition of free-living crabs was predominantly derived from benthic algae and shrimps rather than from epibionts. These epibionts appear to use similar food resources as the host, suggesting a symbiotic relationship more akin to mutualism. Thus, the crabs move from a symbiosis in which they may act as parasites to one where they act as hosts. Such flexible approaches to symbioses may be more common than currently described, particularly in species with different functional roles during individual life stages.","2021","SEP 2021","10.1016/j.marenvres.2021.105479","WOS:000702785100005"

Global change can also suppress the development and effectiveness of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). This is concerning, as AMF have been shown to alleviate the negative influence of global changes on plant growth and maintain species coexistence. However, how AMF and global change interact and influence community temporal stability remains poorly understood. Here, we conducted a 4-year field experiment and used structural equation modeling (SEM) to explore the influence of elevated temperature, nitrogen (N) addition and AMF suppression on community temporal stability (quantified as the ratio of the mean community productivity to its standard deviation) in a temperate meadow in northern China. We found that elevated temperature and AMF suppression independently decreased the community temporal stability but that N addition had no impact. Community temporal stability was mainly driven by elevated temperature, N addition and AMF suppression that modulated the dominant species stability; to a lesser extent by the elevated temperature and AMF suppression that modulated AMF richness associated with community asynchrony; and finally by the N addition and AMF suppression that modulated mycorrhizal colonization. In addition, although N addition, AMF suppression and elevated temperature plus AMF suppression reduced plant species richness, there was no evidence that changes in community temporal stability were linked to changes in plant richness. SEM further showed that elevated temperature, N addition and AMF suppression regulated community temporal stability by influencing both the temporal mean and variation in community productivity. Our results suggest that global environmental changes may have appreciable consequences for the stability of temperate meadows while also highlighting the role of belowground AMF status in the responses of plant community temporal stability to global change.

Previous studies focused on inorganic N sources and specific amino acid forms using N-15 labelling, but knowledge of the contribution of DON to mature conifers' N uptake is still scarce. Here, we quantified the contribution of different N forms (DON vs. NH4+ vs. NO3-) to total N uptake, based on N-15 natural abundance of plant and soil available N, in four mature conifers (Pinus koraiensis, Pinus sylvestris, Picea koraiensis, and Larix olgensis). Results DON contributed 31%, 29%, 28%, and 24% to total N uptake by Larix olgensis, Picea koraiensis, Pinus koraiensis, and Pinus sylvestris, respectively, whereas nitrate contributed 42 to 52% and ammonium contributed 19 to 29% of total N uptake for these four coniferous species. Conclusions Our results suggested that all four conifers could take up a relatively large proportion of nitrate, while DON was also an important N source for the four conifers.

We used principal response curves (PRC) to describe vegetation development trajectories and linear mixed-effects models to test changes in cover of vascular plants and cryptogams, nitrogen requirement groups and restoration species groups with time and treatment. Results Carbon amendment resulted in lower soil nitrogen availability, and lower cover of vascular plants and cryptogams compared to control, but these differences became visible only four to five years after the first application and disappeared three years after the cessation of treatment. Minor treatment effects on the cover of oligotrophic, mesotrophic and target species were found. Conclusions Carbon amendment did not speed up the recovery of sand grasslands; however, the reduction of cover (vegetation and cryptogam) can be a window of opportunity for other species to colonize that can be used as a complement to other treatments.

Geochemical variables and geographic distance are key driving forces shaping the distribution of soil microbial communities, but our understandings are mainly limited to surface soil or shallow unsaturated zone (1-3 m beneath the ground). In this study, soil and sediment samples were collected from the unsaturated zone, through groundwater fluctuated zone, to saturated zone (up to 20 m) to unravel the assembly processes mediating vertical bacterial community succession across these three zones. Our results suggested both geochemical niches and bacterial diversity had different vertical pattems in each zone. With increased depth, pH increased and nutrient levels (C, N, P, K) and bacterial diversity declined in the unsaturated zone, and nutrients and bacterial diversity remained low levels after reaching the fluctuated and saturated zones. Nutrients were the key drivers shaping bacterial variation in the unsaturated zone, but limited nutrients and only 'depth' significantly explained the variations in the fluctuated zone and saturated zone, respectively. The co-occurrence network supported a more species coexistence pattern in the unsaturated zone than that in the other two zones. Due to the geochemical variations across three zones, the assembly of phylogenetically more clustered communities was observed through deterministic processes (e.g., 55% homogenizing selection) in the unsaturated zone, but the stochastic process (e.g., 50%-70% dispersal limitation) was more important in the fluctuated and saturated zones.

Additionally, we added a fungicide (benomyl) to half of the pots to evaluate the role of soil-borne fungi on seedling growth. Important Findings We found that the seedlings from L. glaber grew better in soils that were collected from beneath the canopy of P. massoniana, while seedling growth of P. massioniana was not affected by soil origin. The addition of fungicide benomyl resulted in a shift towards more positive PSF effects for L. glaber, indicating that L. glaber seedlings performed better in their own soils than in soils from P. massoniana in the absence of fungi. Our findings highlight the importance of soil-borne pathogenic and ectomycorrhizal fungi in driving PSF, and indicate that PSF may promote the coexistence of two subtropical tree species by reducing the performance of L. glaber in own soils.","2021",NA,"10.1093/jpe/rtab058","WOS:000784328900015"

Global changes are expected to push many fungi beyond their environmental niches, but there are relatively few studies involving multiple, simultaneous global change factors. Here, we studied soil fungal diversity, community composition, co-occurrence patterns, and decomposition gene responses to 10 years of soil warming and nitrogen addition, alone and in combination. We specifically examined whether there were fungal community characteristics that could explain changes in soil carbon storage and organic matter chemistry in chronically warmed and fertilized soil. We found that fungal communities in warmed soils are less diverse and shift in composition. Warming also favored hyperdominance by a few mycorrhizal fungal species and lowered manganese peroxidase but increased hydrolytic enzyme encoding gene potentials. Nitrogen addition did not significantly affect fungal community composition but, like warming, did reduce fungal diversity and favored overdominance by a unique set of mycorrhizal taxa. Warming alone and in combination with nitrogen addition also reduced negative but increased positive fungal co-occurrence probabilities, promoting species coexistence. Negative fungal co-occurrence was positively correlated to soil carbon content, while the proportion of fungal hydrolytic enzyme encoding genes was negatively correlated with soil carbon content. This may reflect fungal life history trade-offs between competition (e.g., reduced negative co-occurrence) and resource acquisition (e.g., higher abundance of hydrolytic enzyme encoding genes) with implications for carbon storage.","2021",NA,"10.1525/elementa.2021.000059","WOS:000729588900001"
"Liu, QY; Xu, MJ; Yuan, Y; Wang, HM","Interspecific competition for inorganic nitrogen between canopy trees and underlayer-planted young trees in subtropical pine plantations","FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT","Although the area of monospecific plantations in China ranks first in the world, these plantations possess poor disease resistance, low quality, and low ecological benefit. Planting broadleaf seedlings into the understory of monospecific coniferous plantations is an effective and common forest management method to improve plantation structures and enhance their resistance to adverse conditions, disease, and pests. Species that are desired and suitable are selected according to the complementarity of their functional traits to ensure optimal resource utilization and species coexistence. Thus, in Pinus massoniana and Pinus elliottii plantations where three broadleaf species were underplanted, any alterations to root functional traits and inorganic nitrogen (N) uptake rates in response to interspecific competition were studied in situ using 15N isotope labelling technology. The results showed that the five species preferred to absorb ammonium (dominant N form in native soils) rather than nitrate from the soil. Coniferous species showed higher plasticity in root biomass, physiology of N uptake rate, morphology, and mycorrhizal colonization than broadleaf species responding to interspecific competition. Coniferous trees reduced the investment in root biomass while enhanced N uptake rates to acclimate to belowground interspecific competition. Broadleaf species M. maudiae and S. superba were more dependent on mycorrhizal symbiosis to acquire resource in response to environmental variations. The amount of inorganic N uptake by P. massoniana and P. elliottii roots were inhibited by the presence of Michelia maudiae and Schima superba roots, respectively. Based on inorganic N uptake amount, M. maudiae and S. superba may be suitable for underplanting in the P. elliottii and P. massoniana plantations, respectively. Liquidambar formosana was suitable for both two pine plantations. The responses of root N uptake rate, mycorrhizal colonization and morphological traits to interspecific competition can provide supplemental data for species selection to improve structures of artificial plantations.","2021","MAY 2021","10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119331","WOS:000657657400002"

However, we know little about the biogeographical patterns of the beta-diversity of microbial communities harbouring the alkaline phosphatase phoD gene (phoD communities, hereafter) and whether these mechanisms are all-important in shaping phoD communities' beta-diversity in natural steppe ecosystems. Location: Northern Hemisphere steppes. Time period: July to August 2018. Major taxa studied: Alkaline phosphatase (phoD gene) encoding community. Methods: Using the high throughput amplicon sequencing method, soil phoD communities were comparatively studied along three representative regions of the Northern Hemisphere steppes, namely the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, Inner Mongolian Plateau and the Loess Plateau. Each region harbours three types of steppes (habitats): meadow, typical and desert steppes. Results: We observed significantly higher phoD beta-diversity in the Qinghai-Tibetan than in the Loess and Inner Mongolian Plateaus and significantly lower beta-diversity in the typical steppes than in other steppe types. The decay rates of phoD beta-diversity with geographical distance varied in different steppe regions and types. The phoD beta-diversity was not significantly influenced by species pool; instead, environmental filtering, dispersal assembly processes, ecological drift and biotic interactions jointly shaped the beta-diversity patterns. The beta-deviation variations (beta-diversity excluding the effects of species pool) were influenced by spatial and environmental factors and biotic interactions, among which soil pH was the key environmental determinant. The soil pH driving beta-diversity mechanism was steppe region and habitat specific.

"Ursell, T","Structured environments foster competitor coexistence by manipulating interspecies interfaces","PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY","Natural environments, like soils or the mammalian gut, frequently contain microbial consortia competing within a niche, wherein many species contain genetically encoded mechanisms of interspecies competition. Recent computational work suggests that physical structures in the environment can stabilize local competition between species that would otherwise be subject to competitive exclusion under isotropic conditions. Here we employ Lotka-Volterra models to show that interfacial competition localizes to physical structures, stabilizing competitive ecological networks of many species, even with significant differences in the strength of competitive interactions between species. Within a limited range of parameter space, we show that for stable communities the length-scale of physical structure inversely correlates with the width of the distribution of competitive fitness, such that physical environments with finer structure can sustain a broader spectrum of interspecific competition. These results highlight the potentially stabilizing effects of physical structure on microbial communities and lay groundwork for engineering structures that stabilize and/or select for diverse communities of ecological, medical, or industrial utility. Author summary Natural environments often have many species competing for the same resources and frequently one species will out-compete others. This poses the fundamental question of how a diverse array of species can coexist in a resource-limited environment. Among other mechanisms, previous studies examined how interactions between species-like cooperation or predation-could lead to stable biodiversity. In this work we looked at this question from a different angle: we used computational models to examine the role that the environment itself might play in stabilizing species that compete with each other when in proximity. We modeled how species arrange themselves in space when the environment contains objects that alter the interfaces along which competing species meet. We found that these 'structured' environments can stabilize species coexistence, across a range of density of those objects and in a way that was robust to differing strengths of interspecies competition. Thus, in addition to biological factors and other forms of environmental variation, our work presents a potentially generic mechanism by which the physical structure of the environment can influence ecological outcomes and stabilize biodiversity.","2021",NA,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007762","WOS:000608045000005"

Diverse soil microorganisms form a complex assembly and play an important role in agroecosystems by regulating nutrient cycling, promoting plant growth, and alleviating biotic and abiotic stresses. Improving microbial coexistence may be an effective and practical solution for the promotion of soil-plant ecosystem health in the face of the impacts of anthropogenic activities and global climate change. Modern coexistence theory is a useful theoretical framework for studying the coexistence of species that are competing for resources. Here, we briefly introduce the basic framework of modern coexistence theory, including the theoretical definitions and mathematical calculations for niche difference and fitness difference, as well as ways to test for these differences empirically. The possible effects of several major biotic and abiotic factors, such as biological interactions, climate change, environmental stress, and fertilization, on microbial niche and fitness differences are discussed. From the perspective of stabilizing and equalizing mechanisms, the potential roles of microbe-microbe interactions and plant-microbe interactions in promoting healthy soil-microbe-plant continuum are presented. We suggest that the use of the coexistence theory framework for the design and construction of microbial communities in agricultural production can provide a solid basis for the biological improvement of agroecosystems.","2021","AUG 2021","10.1007/s00374-021-01586-w","WOS:000689631900001"

Many theoretical and empirical studies have shown that dynamic feedbacks between plants and soil microbes can stabilize plant coexistence by generating negative frequency-dependent plant population dynamics. However, inferring the net effects of soil microbes on plant coexistence requires also quantifying the degree to which they provide one species an average fitness advantage, an effect that has received little empirical attention. We conducted a greenhouse study to quantify microbially mediated stabilization and fitness differences among 15 pairs of annual plants that co-occur in southern California grasslands. We found that although soil microbes frequently generate negative frequency-dependent dynamics that stabilize plant interactions, they simultaneously generate large average fitness differences between species. The net result is that if the plant species are otherwise competitively equivalent, the impact of plant-soil feedbacks is to often favor species exclusion over coexistence, a result that becomes evident only by quantifying the microbially mediated fitness difference. Our work highlights that comparing the stabilizing effects of plant-soil feedbacks to the fitness difference they generate is essential for understanding the influence of soil microbes on plant diversity.","2021","JAN 2021","10.1086/711662","WOS:000595890900001"

Species with dissimilar traits would partition available resources, increasing niche differences, facilitating coexistence and increasing ecosystem function. Here we first show, using theory and simulations for light-limited phytoplankton, that combing photosynthetic pigments is indeed a necessary condition for coexistence and stimulates ecosystem function. However, pigment richness does mostly not permit the coexistence of more than two species, and increases productivity at most 40% compared to single-pigment communities. That is because blending in more pigments leads to coexistence of species with many pigments and therefore flat absorption spectra, which equalizes their fitness but decreases their niche differences. Similarly, seeding species with more variable size leads to an excess of large-celled species, which does not only decrease fitness differences but also niche differences. Empirical data and additional simulations suggest that pigment richness effects can be stronger during transient dynamics but inevitably weaken with time, that is, pigment richness effects on species richness and function are likely short-lived.

In our bacterial quantitative fitness analysis (BaQFA), arrayed cultures are spotted on agar and photographed sequentially while growing. These time-lapse images are analyzed using a purpose-built opensource software to derive normalized image intensity (NI) values for each culture spot. Subsequently, a Gompertz growth model is fitted to NI values, and fitness is calculated from model parameters. To represent a range of clinically important pathogenic bacteria, we used different strains of Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus, with and without antimicrobial resistance. Relative competitive fitness (RCF) was defined as the mean fitness ratio of two strains growing competitively on one plate. BaQFA permitted the accurate construction of growth curves from bacteria grown on semisolid agar plates and fitting of Gompertz models. Normalized image intensity values showed a strong association with the total CFU/ml count per spotted culture (P < 0.001) for all strains of the three species. BaQFA showed relevant reproductive fitness differences between individual strains, suggesting substantially higher fitness of methicillin-resistant S. aureus JE2 than Cowan (RCF, 1.58; P < 0.001). Similarly, the vancomycin-resistant E. faecium ST172b showed higher competitive fitness than susceptible E. faecium ST172 (RCF, 1.59; P < 0.001). Our BaQFA method allows detection of fitness differences between bacterial strains and may help to estimate epidemiological antimicrobial persistence or contribute to the prediction of clinical outcomes in severe infections. IMPORTANCE Reproductive fitness of bacteria is a major factor in the evolution and persistence of antimicrobial resistance and may play an important role in severe infections. With a computational approach to quantify fitness in bacteria growing competitively on agar plates, our high-throughput method has been designed to obtain additional phenotypic data for antimicrobial resistance analysis at a low cost. Furthermore, our bacterial quantitative fitness analysis (BaQFA) enables the investigation of a link between bacterial fitness and clinical outcomes in severe invasive bacterial infections. This may allow future use of our method for patient management and risk stratification of clinical outcomes. Our proposed method uses open-source software and a hardware setup that can utilize consumer electronics. This will enable a wider community of researchers, including those from low-resource countries, where the burden of antimicrobial resistance is highest, to obtain valuable information about emerging bacterial strains.","2021",NA,"10.1128/mSystems.01323-20","WOS:000647691000008"

While most studies have focused on characterising the impact that S. cerevisiae has on the growth and metabolic activity of these non-Saccharomyces species, microbial interactions work reciprocally. Antagonism or competition of non-Saccharomyces species against S. cerevisiae has been shown to impact subsequent fermentation performance. To date, it remains unclear whether these negative interactions are strain specific. Hence, characterisation of strain-specific responses to co-inoculation would enable the identification of specific S. cerevisiae strain/non-Saccharomyces combinations that minimise the negative impacts of sequential fermentation on fermentation performance. The competitive fitness response of 93 S. cerevisiae strains to several non-Saccharomyces species was simultaneously investigated using a barcoded library to address this knowledge gap. Strain-specific fitness differences were observed across non-Saccharomyces treatments. Results obtained from experiments using selected S. cerevisiae strains sequentially inoculated after Metschnikowia pulcherrima and Torulaspora delbrueckii were consistent with the competitive barcoded library observations.

The prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) fatigue can reach 86% in active disease, persisting in 50%-52% of patients with mild to inactive disease. Fatigue is the commonest reason for work absence in IBD, and patients often report fatigue burden to be greater than that of primary disease symptoms. Relatively few evidence-based treatment options exist, and the aetiology is poorly understood. Aim To review the available data and suggest a possible aetiology of IBD fatigue and to consider the efficacy of existing management strategies and highlight potential future interventions. Methods We reviewed fatigue-related literature in IBD using PubMed database. Results Disease related factors such as inflammation and pharmacological treatments negatively impact skeletal muscle and brain physiology, likely contributing to fatigue symptoms. Secondary factors such as malnutrition, anaemia, sleep disturbance and psychological comorbidity are potential determinants. Immune profile, faecal microbiota composition and physical fitness differ significantly between fatigued and non-fatigued patients, suggesting these may be aetiological factors. Solution-focused therapy, high-dosage thiamine supplementation and biological therapy may reduce fatigue perception in IBD. The effect of physical activity interventions is inconclusive. Conclusions A multimodal approach is likely required to treat IBD fatigue. Established reversible factors like anaemia, micronutrient deficiencies and active disease should initially be resolved. Psychosocial intervention shows potential efficacy in reducing fatigue perception in quiescent disease. Restoring physical deconditioning by exercise training intervention may further improve fatigue burden.","2021","JUL 2021","10.1111/apt.16465","WOS:000670025600001"

Niche differentiation within bacterial communities, indicated by nearest taxon index and niche breadth of bacterial communities, did not significantly correlate with nutrient availability gradients in either environment, even though deterministic processes dominated bacterial community assembly.

Here we find that the responses of nitrite oxidation to nitrite and oxygen concentrations vary along a redox gradient in a Pacific Ocean oxygen minimum zone, indicating niche differentiation of nitrite-oxidizing assemblages. Notably, we observe the full inhibition of nitrite oxidation by oxygen addition and nitrite oxidation coupled with nitrogen loss in the absence of oxygen consumption in samples collected from anoxic waters. Nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, including novel clades with high relative abundance in anoxic depths, were also detected in the same samples.

To investigate the mechanisms underlying this distinct phenomenon, we assessed the fitness of the engineered plasmid pBAD-tet(X6) in different host bacteria by monitoring their growth curves, relative fitness and the ability of biofilm formation, as well as virulence in a Galleria mellonella model. MIC and qRT-PCR analysis indicated the successful expression of the tet(X6) gene in these strains in the presence of l-arabinose.

Although adaptive evolution must be fueled by beneficial mutations, whether higher mutation rates facilitate the rate of adaptive evolution remains unclear. To address this question, we cultured Escherichia coil hypermutating populations, in which a defective methyl -directed mismatch repair pathway causes a 140 -fold increase in single -nucleotide mutation rates. In parallel with wild -type E. coil, populations were cultured in tubes containing Luria-Bertani broth, a complex medium known to promote the evolution of subpopulation structure. After 900 days of evolution, in three transfer schemes with different population -size bottlenecks, hypermutators always exhibited similar levels of improved fitness as controls. Fluctuation tests revealed that the mutation rates of hypermutator lines converged evolutionarily on those of wild -type populations, which may have contributed to the absence of fitness differences. Further genome-sequence analysis revealed that, although hypermutator populations have higher rates of genomic evolution, this largely reflects strong genetic linkage. Despite these linkage effects, the evolved population exhibits parallelism in fixed mutations, including those potentially related to biofilm formation, transcription regulation, and mutation -rate evolution. Together, these results are generally inconsistent with a hypothesized positive relationship between the mutation rate and the adaptive speed of evolution, and provide insight into how clonal adaptation occurs in novel environments.","2021","NOV 2021","10.1093/gbe/evab257","WOS:000743807700003"

Such a scenario results in a transient pattern with clumps and gaps of species abundance along the niche axis (e.g. represented by body size). From this perspective, clumps are groups of coexisting species with negligible fitness differences and stochastic abundance fluctuations. Plankton is an excellent model system for developing and testing ecological theories, especially those related to size structure and species coexistence. We tested EN predictions using the phytoplankton community along the course of a tropical river considering 1) body size structure, 2) functional clustering of species in terms of morphology-based functional groups (MBFG) and 3) the functional similarity among species concerning their functional traits. Two main clumps in the body size axis (clump I and II) were conspicuous through time and were detected in different stretches of the river. Clump I comprised medium-sized species from the MBFGs IV, V and VI while clump II included large-bodied species from the MBFGs V and VI. Pairwise differences in species biovolume correlated with species functional similarity when the whole species pool was considered, but not among species within the same clump. Although clumps comprised multiple MBFGs, the dominant species within the clump belonged always to the same MBFG. Also, within-clump species biovolume increased with functional distinctiveness considering both seasons and stretches, except the lower course. These results suggest that species within clumps behave in a quasi-neutral state, but even minor shifts in trait composition may affect species biovolume.

A quantitative trait-based approach sought relationships between taxa, traits and niche in terrestrial prokaryotes. With 175 taxa from 11 Phyla and 35 Families (n = 5 per Family), traits were considered as discrete counts of shared genome-encoded proteins. Trait composition strongly supported non-random functional distributions as preferential clustering of related taxa via unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean. Trait similarity between taxa increased as taxonomic rank decreased. A suite of Random Forest models identified traits significantly enriched or depleted in taxonomic groups. These traits conveyed functions related to rapid growth, nutrient acquisition and stress tolerance consistent with their presence in copiotroph-oligotroph niches. Hierarchical clustering of traits identified a Glade of competitive, copiotrophic Families resilient to oxidative stress versus glycosyl-transferase-enriched oligotrophic Families resistant to antimicrobials and environmental stress.

In this study, an artificial microbial community has been cultivated without and with LDIR, respectively. The microbial community was composed of three common microbial species, i.e., Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the ISS. After analyzing the differences in microbial physiological and behavioral response characteristics in the two scenarios, a reasonable hypothesis was proposed to elucidate the formation and maintenance mechanisms of high microbial diversity in oligotrophic environments with the LDIR. Then a set of kinetic models with time-lag were developed based on this hypothesis, observed phenomena, and experimental data. Finally, these kinetic models were sufficiently validated, and the hypothesis was fully confirmed through large-scale digital simulations. Briefly, as a decisive succession mechanism in oligotrophic environments with LDIR, temporal niche differentiation (TND) caused by microbial delayed responses to LDIR can give rise to asynchronously convergent fluctuations of microbial populations and significantly alleviate the intra- and interspecific competitions. Such a mechanism can drive the microbial communities in oligotrophic environments with LDIR to form and maintain high species diversity.","2021","SEP 2021","10.1016/j.lssr.2021.08.003","WOS:000703592100011"

However, the understanding of the distribution and niche differentiation of comammox Nitrospira in the estuarine mudflats and their reclaimed agricultural soils is still limited. Here, we investigated the abundance, diversity and community structures of comammox Nitrospira in the mudflats and the reclaimed agricultural soils in the northern Yangtze River estuary. Quantitative PCR showed the abundances of amoA genes of comammox were lower than that of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in nearly all samples. Amplicon sequencing of amoA genes revealed that the community structures of comammox Nitrospira were significantly (P < 0.001) different between the original mudflats and the reclaimed agricultural soils, indicating niche differentiation among comammox Nitrospira clades (clade A.1, clade A.2, and clade B).

However, the members of clade A.2 could be clearly divided into two groups, the mudflat-preferred and agricultural soil-preferred groups, suggesting more complicated ecological preferences within this sub-clade. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that salinity, organic matter (OM) and NO3--N had a significantly influence on the distribution of comammox Nitrospira in the estuarine environment. Clade A.1 and nearly half members of clade A.2 were positively correlated with salinity, and negatively correlated with the concentrations of OM and NO3--N. In contrast, the clade B and the other half members of clade A.2 showed the exact opposite pattern: a negative correlation with salinity and positive correlation with OM and NO3--N. The co-occurrence network demonstrated that the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) within the same (sub-)clade were mostly positively correlated, indicating the similar niche preferences among the members from the same (sub-)clade of comammox Nitrospira. Taken together, our results revealed the niche differentiation of comammox Nitrospira in estuarine ecosystems where salinity and OM were the primary factors responsible for the distinct ecological distribution patterns.","2021",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2020.618287","WOS:000612336000001"

Compared to horizontal subsurface flow (HSSF) and surface flow (SF) CWs, the aerobic vertical flow (VF) CW enriched more functional bacteria carrying genes for nitrification (nxrA, amoA), denitrification (nosZ), dephosphorization (phoD), and methane oxidation (mmoX), while the removal of COD, total P, and total N increased by 33.28%, 255.28%, and 299.06%, respectively. The co-occurrence network of functional bacteria in the HSSF CW was complex, with equivalent bacterial cooperation and competition. Both the VF and SF CWs exhibited a simple functional topological structure. The VF CW reduced functional redundancy by forming niche differentiation, which filtered out keystone species that were closely related to each other, thus achieving effective sewage purification. Alternatively, bacterial niche overlap protected a single function in the SF CW. Compared with the construction type, temperature, and plants had less effect on nutrient removal in the CWs from this subtropical region. Partial least-squares path modeling (PLS-PM) suggests that high dissolved oxygen and oxidation-reduction potential promoted a diverse bacterial community and that the nonkeystone bacteria reduced external stress for functional bacteria, thereby indirectly promoting nutrient removal.","2021","SEP 2021","10.1021/acs.est.1c03880","WOS:000699957900049"

Here, we analyzed the proteomes from litter, plant roots, rhizosphere, and bulk soil in a temperate coniferous forest at two time points to improve the understanding of the interplay between bacterial and eukaryotic communities in different habitats. Our metaproteomic approach yielded a total of 139,127 proteins that allowed to differentiate the contribution of microbial taxa to protein expression as well as the general functionality based on KEGG Orthology in each habitat.

While CAZymes in roots and litter targeted mostly the structural biopolymers of plant origin such as lignin and cellulose, the majority of CAZymes in bulk and rhizosphere soil targeted oligosaccharides, starch, and glycogen. Proteins involved in nitrogen cycling were mainly of bacterial origin. Most nitrogen cycling proteins in litter and roots participated in ammonium assimilation while those performing nitrification were the most abundant in bulk and rhizosphere soil.

However, little is known about their role in complex bacterial communities, either within a phylogenetic framework or as a function of niche breadth. Based on data obtained in a field study in the St. Lawrence Estuary, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to examine the vertical patterns, strength, and character of AORs for particle-attached and free-living bacterial assemblages. Free-living communities were phylogenetically more diverse than particle-attached communities. The dominant taxa were consistent in terms of their presence/absence but population abundances differed in surface water vs. the cold intermediate layer. Significant, positive AORs characterized all of the surveyed communities across all taxonomic ranks of bacteria, thus demonstrating an ecologically conserved trend for both free-living and particle-attached bacteria. The strength of the AORs was low at the species level but higher at and above the genus level.

We investigated the environmental drivers of composition, richness, and root colonization of FRE and AMF by using structural equation modelling and canonical correspondence analyses. Root colonization by FRE increased with increasing temperature and rainfall but decreased with increasing phosphorus (P). Root colonization by AMF increased with increasing soil organic carbon but decreased with increasing P. Richness of FRE decreased with increasing temperature and soil pH. Richness of AMF increased with increasing temperature and rainfall but decreased with increasing soil aluminium (Al) and pH. Aluminium, soil pH, and rainfall were, in decreasing order, the strongest drivers of community composition of FRE; they were also important drivers of community composition of AMF, along with temperature, in decreasing order: rainfall, Al, temperature, and soil pH.

This study investigated their abundance and community structure in four alpine grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau with quantitative PCR and high-throughput sequencing. Potential ammonia oxidation (PAO) was measured and partitioned by inhibitor method. PAO was mainly dominated by AOA. PAO and potential nitrite oxidation (PNO) significantly decreased, while the apparent half-saturation constant (Km) had no significant change along a grassland degradation gradient. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the predominant AOA, AOB, and NOB were Nitrososphaera, Nitrosospira, and Nitrospira lineages, respectively. Network analyses revealed that the alpine nitrifying co-occurrence network had a modular structure that was mainly shaped by taxonomic relatedness and environmental relationships, indicating different nitrifying species occupy disparate niches. Soil pH, ammonium, and moisture were the main drivers for variation in AOA, AOB, and NOB communities, respectively.

Given the enormous number of individuals integrating the communities and our limited capacity to count and determine most of them, we likely observe only alternative population peaks of some of the coexisting species. The contemporary coexistence theory addresses coexistence in communities of competing species, considering relative fitness inequalities and stabilising niche differences as components of average long-term growth rates. Here, we experimentally show that the response patterns predicted by the theory occur when varying nutrient pulses fertilise the planktonic community. We used gently self-filling 100-L enclosures to minimise the disturbance of the initial community and different pulse P and N additions to manipulate the apparently species-poor epilimnetic community of an ultraoligotrophic P-limited lake. We measured and compared the protist species growth response to gradients of P enrichment and N stoichiometric imbalance. The P and N levels used in most treatments were within the oligotrophic seasonal and inter-annual variations of the lake and were higher in a few extreme treatments that provided mesotrophic conditions of the remote regions affected by N atmospheric contamination. We alternatively replicated all treatments using ammonium or nitrate as the N source. Most protist species, recorded in this lake across seasons in previous studies, were recovered, indicating a persistent assemblage of species that is seasonally hidden from observation. Recovery included some rare species observed only in the slush layers of the seasonal snow and ice cover. The coexistence-stabilising mechanisms were indicated by treatment response features, such as frequency-dependent growth, inverse relationship between fitness inequality and niche differentiation proxies, high-rank taxonomic levels clustering across the limiting-nutrient gradient but segregation at the species level according to the type of N supply and resting stage development depending on nutrient conditions. The response similarities between autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms indicate a network of interactions that may reinforce coexistence. Synthesis. The results indicate that many planktonic protist species in oligotrophic waters can show stable long-term non-equilibrium coexistence by alternately recovering from very low densities when episodic nutrient enrichments, of varying P and N amounts and composition, occur.","2021","JAN 2021","10.1111/1365-2745.13591","WOS:000612358100001"

The species-specific resources and regulators defining the realized niches (sensu Hutchinson) of the two species were identified. Differences in vertical distribution, daily vertical migration and in situ division rates (with record values, 0.76 d-1, in D. acuta), in response to the environmental conditions and potential prey availability, revealed their niche differences. The Outlying Mean Index (OMI) analysis showed that the realized niche of D. acuta (cell maximum 7 x 103 cells L-1 within the pycnocline) was characterized by sub-surface estuarine waters (salinity 23 - 25), lower values of turbulence and PAR, and a narrow niche breath. In contrast, the realized niche of D. acuminata (cell maximum 6.8 x 103 cells L-1 just above the pycnocline) was characterized by fresher (salinity 17 - 20) outflowing surface waters, with higher turbulence and light intensity and a wider niche breadth. Results from OMI and PERMANOVA analyses of co-occurring microplanktonic ciliates were compatible with the hypothesis of species such as those from genera Pseudotontonia and Strombidium constituting an alternative ciliate prey to Mesodinium. The D. acuta cell maximum was associated with DSP (OA and DTX-1) toxins and pectenotoxins; that of D. acuminata only with pectenotoxins.

Despite its potential generality, the theory still mostly focuses on how resource-consumer dynamics mediate competition in ecological communities. However, it is being increasingly recognized that positive interactions between organisms also play an important role in driving the structure and functioning of ecological communities, from plants to microbes. In this paper, we present a unified theory of the niche that applies to both positive and negative interactions between organisms, mediated by one or two environmental factors. We show that classical concepts such as niche differences and fundamental and realized niches can naturally be expanded to facilitative and mutualistic interactions. In addition, we introduce and formalize new general niche concepts that appear exclusively in the presence of positive interactions: (1) the Allee niche, a region of environmental conditions for which a species can persist but not invade from low densities and (2) niche facilitation, when the presence of a species expands the set of environmental conditions under which a second species can invade and/or persist. To show the broad applicability of this theory, we illustrate these concepts using a diverse set of theoretical examples, from bacteria feeding on an inhibiting substrate, to nitrogen-fixing plants and the indirect mutualism between a plant and a carnivore species. In sum, our work shows how Niche Theory provides a natural framework for positive interactions in ecology, bringing a unified perspective and new conceptual tools to study ecological systems where these positive interactions occur.","2021","JUN 2021","10.1002/ecm.1458","WOS:000662054900001"
"Ma, Z","Niche-neutral theoretic approach to mechanisms underlying the biodiversity and biogeography of human microbiomes","EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS","The human microbiome consists of five major regional biomes distributed in or on our five body sites including skin, oral, lung, gut, and reproductive tract. Its biogeography (the spatial and temporal distribution of its biodiversity) has far-reaching implications to our health and diseases. Nevertheless, we currently have very limited understanding on themechanismsshaping the biogeography, since it is often rather difficult to determine the relative importance of drift, dispersal, speciation, and selection, the four processes (mechanisms) determining the patterns of microbial biogeography and community dynamics according to a recent synthesis in community ecology and biogeography. To disentangle these mechanisms, I utilize multisite neutral (MSN) model and niche-neutral hybrid (NNH) model to analyze large number of truly multisite microbiome samples covering all five major human microbiome habitats, including 699 metacommunities and 5,420 local communities. Approximately 89% of metacommunities and 92% local communities exhibit patterns indistinguishable from neutral, and 20% indistinguishable from niche-neutral hybrid model, indicating the relative significance of stochastic neutral forces versus deterministic niche selection in shaping the biogeography of human microbiome. These findings cast supporting evidence to van der Gast's revision to classic Bass-Becking doctrine of microbial biogeography: Some things are everywhere and some things are not. Sometimes the environment selects and sometimes it doesn't, offering the first educated guess for some and sometimes in the revised doctrine. Furthermore, the logistic/Cox regression models describing the relationships among community neutrality, niche differentiation, and key community/species characteristics (including community diversity, community/species dominance, speciation, and migration rates) were constructed to quantitatively describe the niche-neutral continuum and the influences of community/species properties on the continuum.","2021","OCT 2020","10.1111/eva.13116","WOS:000578713500001"

A large amount of tea polyphenols have fallen down over soil with prunning residues every year. However, the effect of tea polyphenols on soil nitrogen cycle, especially the denitrification process and its related microbial communities, remains unclear. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the most abundant component of tea polyphenols, was selected to simulate the effects of tea polyphenols on soil nitrification, denitrification, related functional genes and microbial community. The results indicated that addition of EGCG can significantly (p < 0.05) inhibit soil nitrification. Copy numbers of bacterial and archaeal ammonia monooxygenase genes (amoA) decreased as EGCG concentration increased. Further, the ammonia oxidisers exhibited a significantly (p < 0.05) greater niche differentiation under the effect of EGCG compared with the control treatment (no EGCG addition). However, the inhibition effect of EGCG over soil denitrification was most significant at 34 and 36 day of incubation period, and such inhibitory effect was more apparent on nitrification compared with denitrification. EGCG addition increased the diversity of bacterial community. The composition of bacterial community was significantly altered and community variation was primary explained by EGCG, NH4+-N, NO3--N, soil organic carbon contents and potential denitrification rates. EGCG addition significantly increased relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla whereas decreased Actinobacteria. Overall, tea polyphenols can inhibit soil nitrification to a larger extent than denitrification by reducing the abundance of microorganisms carrying the related functional genes. Our results can serve as important basis of reducing the nitrogen pollution risk in tea orchards and could be considered as a powerful natural nitrification inhibitor to reduce the environmental risks caused by unreasonable nitrogen fertiliser adaptation.

We analyzed a group of closely related species from the subgenus Neritrema (genus Littorina, Caenogastropoda) from the gravel-bouldery shores. In two distant sites at the Barents and Norwegian Sea, we examined the patterns of snail distribution during low tide (quantitative sampling stratified by intertidal level, presence of macrophytes, macrophyte species, and position on them), shell shape and its variability (geometric morphometrics), and metabolic characteristics (metabolomic profiling). The studied species diversified microbiotopes, which imply an important role of ecological specification in the recent evolution of this group. The only exception to this trend was the species pair L. arcana / L. saxatilis, which is specifically discussed. The ecological divergence was accompanied by differences in shell shape and metabolomic characteristics. Significant differences were found between L. obtusata versus L. fabalis and L. saxatilis / L. arcana versus L. compressa both in shell morphology and in metabolomes. L. saxatilis demonstrated a clear variability depending on intertidal level which corresponds to a shift in conditions within the occupied microhabitat. Interestingly, the differences between L. arcana (inhabiting the upper intertidal level) and L. compressa (inhabiting the lower one) were analogous to those between the upper and lower fractions of L. saxatilis. No significant level-dependent changes were found between the upper and lower fractions of L. obtusata, most probably due to habitat amelioration by fucoid macroalgae.

Although organic fertilization regulating aggregation has been well studied in various soils, how organic fertilization mediates microbial groups involved in soil N cycle in aggregates remained largely unclear. Therefore, the objective was to investigate the effect of 27 years of application of mineral and organic fertilizers (peanut straw, rice straw, radish, and pig manure) on the abundance of major microbial groups involved in the soil N cycle in four soil aggregate size classes. The results showed that organic fertilizers exerted significant impacts on the communities of microbes possessing N-cycling related genes, with pig manure having a more important effect than plant residues. However, aggregate size classes contributed more to the variation (20%) than organic fertilizers (12%). Organic fertilizer types did not impact the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) or ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). However, aggregate size strongly altered the abundance of AOA, but not AOB, with AOA being particularly abundant in <53 mu m aggregates. Organic fertilizers and aggregate size significantly influenced the abundance of the nirS gene rather than the nirK gene. There were greater amounts of nirS in the soils treated with rice straw and pig manure, primarily due to the higher soil organic matter content. As for fungal denitrification, there was a greater abundance of FnirK in microaggregates than in macroaggregates. Organic fertilizers and aggregate size significantly influenced the abundance of nosZ I and nosZ II genes, with aggregate size playing a more pronounced role. The abundance of nosZ I increased with increasing aggregate size while the abundance of nosZ II gene showed the opposite trends. This result revealed the clear niche differentiation of nosZ I and nosZ II genes in Ultisols, with nosZ I and nosZ II preferred to inhabit in macroaggregates and microaggregates, respectively.

This represents an important knowledge gap because changes in microbial networks could have implications for their functionality and vulnerability to future disturbances. Here, we compare the spatiotemporal and biogeographical patterns of bacterioplankton molecular ecological networks using high-throughput sequencing of Illumina HiSeq and multivariate statistical analyses from a subtropical river during wet and dry seasons. Results demonstrated that the lower reaches (high human activity intensity) network had less of an average degree (10.568/18.363), especially during the dry season, when compared with the upper reaches (low human activity intensity) network (10.685/37.552) during the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The latter formed more complexity networks with more modularity (0.622/0.556) than the lower reaches (high human activity intensity) network (0.505/0.41) during the wet and dry seasons, respectively. Bacterioplankton molecular ecological network under high human activity intensity became significantly less robust, which is mainly caused by altering of the environmental conditions and keystone species. Human activity altered the composition of modules but preserved their ecological roles in the network and environmental factors (dissolved organic carbon, temperature, arsenic, oxidation-reduction potential and Chao1 index) were the best parameters for explaining the variations in bacterioplankton molecular ecological network structure and modules. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the keystone phylum in shaping the structure and niche differentiations in the network. In addition, the lower reaches (high human activity intensity) reduce the bacterioplankton diversity and ecological niche differentiation, which deterministic processes become more important with increased farmland and constructed land area (especially farmland) with only 35% and 40% of the community variation explained by the neutral community model during the wet season and dry season, respectively. Keystone species in high human activity intensity stress habitats yield intense functional potentials and Bacterioplankton communities harbor keystone taxa in different human activity intensity stress habitats, which may exert their influence on microbiome network composition regardless of abundance. Therefore, human activity plays a crucial role in shaping the structure and function of bacterioplankton molecular ecological networks in subtropical rivers and understanding the mechanisms of this process can provide important information about human-water interaction processes, sustainable uses of freshwater as well as watershed management and conservation.","2021",NA,"10.3390/microorganisms9071532","WOS:000676379500001"

These communities are excellent models to explore biotic and abiotic drivers of diversity because they are of low complexity. Using high-throughput amplicon and metagenome sequencing, combined with X-ray computed tomography, we investigated how water availability and substrate architecture modulated the taxonomic and functional composition of gypsum endolithic communities in the Atacama Desert, Chile. We found that communities inhabiting gypsum rocks with a more fragmented substrate architecture had higher taxonomic and functional diversity, despite having less water available. This effect was tightly linked with community connectedness and likely the result of niche differentiation. Gypsum communities were functionally similar, yet adapted to their unique micro-habitats by modulating their carbon and energy acquisition strategies and their growth modalities. Reconstructed population genomes showed that these endolithic microbial populations encoded potential pathways for anoxygenic phototrophy and atmospheric hydrogen oxidation as supplemental energy sources.","2021","DEC 2020","10.1111/1462-2920.15287","WOS:000594410100001"

Collembola are among the most abundant arthropods inhabiting the belowground system sensitively responding to changes in vegetation and soil conditions. However, most studies on the response of Collembola to land-use change were conducted in temperate ecosystems and focused on shifts in community composition or morphological traits, while parameters more closely linked to ecosystem functioning, such as trophic niches, received little attention. Here, we used stable isotope analysis (C-13 and N-15) to investigate changes in the trophic structure and use of food resources by Collembola in Jambi province (Sumatra, Indonesia), a region that experienced strong deforestation in the last decades. Isotopic values of Collembola from 32 sites representing four land-use systems were analyzed (rainforest, rubber agroforest, rubber (Hevea brasiliansis) and oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) monoculture plantations). Across Collembola species Delta C-13 values were highest in rainforest suggesting more pronounced processing of litter resources by microorganisms and consumption of these microorganisms by Collembola in this system. Lower Delta C-13 values, but high Delta C-13 variation in Collembola in oil palm plantations indicated that Collembola shifted towards herbivory and used more variable resources in this system. Small range in Delta N-15 values in Collembola species in monoculture plantations in comparison to rainforest indicated that conversion of rainforest into plantations is associated with simplification in the trophic structure of Collembola communities. This was further confirmed by generally lower isotopic niche differentiation among species in plantations. Across the studied ecosystems, atmobiotic species (Symphypleona and Paronellidae) occupied the lowest, whereas euedaphic Collembola species occupied the highest trophic position, resembling patterns in temperate forests. Some species of Paronellidae in rainforest and jungle rubber had Delta N-15 values below those of leaf litter suggesting algivory (Salina sp.1, Callyntrura sp.1 and Lepidonella sp.1), while a dominant species, Pseudosinella sp.1, had the highest Delta N-15 values in most of the land-use systems suggesting that this species at least in part lives as predator or scavenger. Overall, the results suggest that rainforest conversion into plantation systems is associated with marked shifts in the structure of trophic niches in soil and litter Collembola with potential consequences for ecosystem functioning and food-web stability.","2021",NA,"10.7717/peerj.10971","WOS:000624294300012"

This concept is central to understanding phenomena ranging from the role of climate change impacts on species biogeography to community dynamics. Marine zooplankton have been used as indicators of global change in the ocean, and niche conservatism is usually assumed for these organisms due to their high dispersal capacity, which may limit the development of local adaptations. However, recent evidence suggests that several zooplankton species with a circumglobal distribution are comprised of several cryptic species complexes, but it is unknown if the niches of cryptic species complexes have remained conserved or if they have diverged. Habitat management based on niche modelling would be strengthened by better understanding patterns of niche conservation or divergence, as the usual assumption that species have fixed environmental niches may be misleading. We assess the niche differences for 15 copepod species with populations in the North Atlantic, Southern Ocean and Australia. Pairwise differences in the realised niches were computed for each species using two complementary analyses. Our analysis indicates that global-scale niche modelling of zooplankton cannot assume niche conservatism across all lineages and future studies should look to incorporate phylogenetic information to improve future niche estimates.","2021","SEP 2021","10.1111/ecog.05690","WOS:000697657800001"

Here, we applied live cell sorting, activity screening, and subcultivation on marine nitrite-oxidizing enrichments to obtain novel marine Nitrospinae. Two binary cultures were obtained, each containing one Nitrospinae strain and one alphaproteobacterial heterotroph. The Nitrospinae strains represent two new genera, and one strain is more closely related to environmentally abundant Nitrospinae than previously cultured NOB. With an apparent half-saturation constant of 8.7 +/- 2.5 mu M, this strain has the highest affinity for nitrite among characterized marine NOB, while the other strain (16.2 +/- 1.6 mu M) andNitrospina gracilis(20.1 +/- 2.1 mu M) displayed slightly lower nitrite affinities.

Our results indicate specialist species have rewired regulatory networks active during wood decay towards decreased reliance on enzymatic machinery, and therefore nitrogen-intensive decay components. This shift was likely accompanied with adaptation to a narrow tree line habitat and switch to a pioneer decomposer strategy, both requiring rapid colonization of a nitrogen-limited substrate. Among substrate specialists with narrow niches, we also found evidence for pathways facilitating reversal to generalism, highlighting how evolution may move along different axes of niche space.","2021","OCT 2020","10.1038/s41396-020-00799-5","WOS:000580586900002"

The microbial communities associated with the acorn's embryo and pericarp and the developing seeding's phyllosphere and root systems were analysed using amplicon sequencing of fungal ITS and bacterial 16S rDNA. Results showed that the seed microbiome is diverse and non-randomly distributed within an acorn. The microbial composition of the phyllosphere was diverse and strongly resembled the composition found in the embryo, whereas the roots and pericarp each had a less diverse and distinct microbial community.

Three models were developed, first with only the 19 bioclimatic variables plus elevation from the WorldClim database, second with regularization to correct for pseudo-absence, and third with additional categorical environmental layer on snow cover. All three models showed high mean AUC (area under the curve) values (>0.970). Output maps were comparable, with the third model perhaps the most realistic. For this model, snow cover, precipitation of the coldest quarter (of the year), and elevation predicted best the distribution of Ph. albescens. Elevation alone is a good predictor only in some regions, since (i) elevation of the occurrence points decreases with increasing latitude, and (ii) elevation wrongly predicts the species' occurrence in arid mountain ranges. The model showed mountains in humid climates with highest incidence, which confirmed field studies: a long-lasting snow cover fluctuating with comparatively mild summers is the decisive factor. As such, the model can serve as a predictive map where fructifications of nivicolous myxomycetes can be expected. Limitations of the model are discussed: cryptic speciation within a morphospecies, including the evolution of reproductively isolated units which may lead to local adaptation and niche differentiation, and wider ranges for myxamoebal populations.","2021","JUN 2021","10.1016/j.funeco.2021.101079","WOS:000686132100001"

To better understand underlying biogeochemical processes, it is necessary to know the structure of soil archaeal and bacterial communities and their responses to edaphic and climate variables within and across various land cover types (LCTs) and environmental zones (ENZs). Here we sampled eighty-nine sites across five ENZs and four LCTs within the Western Pacific region. Through leveraging the second-generation sequencing of topsoil samples, we showed that alpha-diversity (taxonomic diversity) of archaea strongly varied within LCT's, whereas bacterial alpha-diversity was significantly controlled by both LCT and ENZ. Soil archaea and bacteria showed global niche differentiation associated with contrasting diversity responses to latitude and differential responses of microbial diversity patterns to edaphic and climate variables within LCTs and ENZs. In contrast to alpha-diversity, microbial beta-diversity (the compositional dissimilarity between sites) was majorly governed by ENZs, particularly for archaea (P < 0.01).

However, the AOM pathways in paddy soils, the largest agricultural source of methane emissions (31 Mio tons per year) are not yet well described. Here, a combination of C-13 isotope tracer, phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) analyses, and microbial community analysis was used to identify AOM pathways in fertilized (pig manure, biochar, NPK, and the control) paddy soils amended with alternative electron acceptors (AEAs) (NO3-, Fe3+, SO42-, humic acids, and the reference without AEAs addition). After 84 days of anaerobic incubation, the microbial co-occurrence network got tightened and became more complex relative to unincubated samples. Fertilization and AEAs addition led to a strong divergence of the microbial community structure as indicated by abundances of AOM-related microbiota and C-13 incorporation into microbial PLFA, thus suggesting an environmental niche differentiation of AOM-involved microorganisms. Comparative analyses revealed a set of major and minor AOM pathways with synergistic relations to complementary anaerobic microbial groups. NO3--driven AOM, performed by members of the candidate group ANME-2d, was the major AOM pathway. Minor AOM pathways involved NO2- reduction by NC10, reduction of humic acids and Fe3+ by Geobacter species, and SO42- reduction by sulfate-reducing bacteria linked with anaerobic methanotrophs. As identified by the network analysis, these active AOM pathways compensated a fraction of CH4 produced during ongoing methanogenesis.

We hypothesized that generalist fungi, which are adaptable to various environmental conditions, could potentially dominate the community and become the basis for fungal coexisting networks in cropping systems. In this study, we identified the generalist and habitat specialist fungi in cropland soils across a 2,200 kms environmental gradient, including three bioclimatic regions (subtropical, warm temperate, and temperate). A few fungal taxa in our database were classified as generalist taxa (similar to 1%). These generalists accounted for >35% of the relative abundance of all fungal populations, and most of them are Ascomycota and potentially pathotrophic. Compared to the specialist taxa (5-17% of all phylotypes in three regions), generalists had a higher degree of connectivity and were often identified as hub within the network. Structural equation modeling provided further evidence that after accounting for spatial and climatic/edaphic factors, generalists had larger contributions to the fungal coexistence pattern than habitat specialists. Taken together, our study provided evidence that generalist taxa are crucial components for fungal community structure. The knowledge of generalists can provide important implication for understanding the ecological preference of fungal groups in cropland systems.","2021",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2021.678290","WOS:000675875200001"

Previous studies on DNRA bacterial diversity and composition focused on the surface sediments in estuaries, but studies on the deep sediments are limited, and the linkage between DNRA community structure and complex estuarine environment remains unclear. In this study, through high-throughput sequencing of nrfA gene followed by high-resolution sample inference, we examined spatially and temporally the composition and diversity of DNRA bacteria along a salinity gradient in five sediment cores of the Pearl River Estuary (PRE). We found a higher diversity and richness of DNRA bacteria in sediments with lower organic carbon, where sea water intersects fresh water. Moreover, the DNRA bacterial communities had the specific spatially distribution coupling with their metabolic difference along the salinity gradient of the Pearl River Estuary, but no obvious difference along the sediment depth. The distribution of DNRA bacteria in the PRE was largely driven by various environmental factors, including salinity, Oxidation-Reduction Potential (ORP), ammonium, nitrate and C-org/NO3-. Furthermore, dominant DNRA bacteria were found to be the key populations of DNRA communities in the PRE sediments by network analysis.

Here, we experimentally resolved the central carbon metabolism of the anammox bacteriumCandidatus'Kuenenia stuttgartiensis' using time-series(13)C and(2)H isotope tracing, metabolomics, and isotopically nonstationary metabolic flux analysis. Our findings confirm predicted metabolic pathways used for CO(2)fixation, central metabolism, and amino acid biosynthesis inK. stuttgartiensis, and reveal several instances where genomic predictions are not supported by in vivo metabolic fluxes. This includes the use of the oxidative branch of an incomplete tricarboxylic acid cycle for alpha-ketoglutarate biosynthesis, despite the genome not having an annotated citrate synthase. We also demonstrate thatK. stuttgartiensisis able to directly assimilate extracellular formate via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway instead of oxidizing it completely to CO(2)followed by reassimilation. In contrast, our data suggest thatK. stuttgartiensisis not capable of using acetate as a carbon or energy source in situ and that acetate oxidation occurred via the metabolic activity of a low-abundance microorganism in the bioreactor's side population.

Methods Here, we grew maize in rhizoboxes with two contrasting soil types and different localized P supplies. In situ soil zymography was applied to examine the spatial-temporal variation of APase activity. Results We found P-rich patches can induce the secretion of APase from roots, indicating that even mineral P fertilizers were localized apply, mobilization of soil organic P by roots can also be enhanced; APase hotspot areas and APase activities in the rhizosphere and bulk soil of the same rhizobox showed opposite diurnal rhythms across the whole soil profile. The APase hotspot area was 10-140% larger at noon than at midnight in the rhizosphere, which is consistent with the diurnal rhythm of photosynthesis. In contrast, in bulk soil, the area was 18-200% larger at midnight than at noon, which led to spatiotemporal niche differentiation with regard to the utilization of soil organic P; this alleviated competition between plants and soil microorganisms.

Investigating whether selection has led to ecological divergence between phylogenetic clades can help understand the basis of speciation, and has implications for predicting biological safety across this group. Using three most terrestrial species in this group (B. cereus, Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus mycoides) we charactererized ecological specialization in terms of resource use, thermal adaptation and fitness in different environmental conditions and tested whether taxonomic species or phylogenetic clade best explained phenotypic variation. All isolates grew vigorously in protein rich media and insect cadavers, but exploitation of soil or plant derived nutrients was similarly weak for all. For B. thuringiensis and B. mycoides, clade and taxonomic species were important predictors of relative fitness in insect infections. Fully psychrotolerant isolates could outcompete B. thuringiensis in insects at low temperature, although psychrotolerance predicted growth in artificial media better than clade. In contrast to predictions, isolates in the Bacillus anthracis clade had sub-optimal growth at 37 degrees C. The common ecological niche in these terrestrial B. cereus species is the ability to exploit protein rich resources such as cadavers. However, selection has led to different phylogenetic groups developing different strategies for accessing this resource.

Soil microbial diversity affects soil chemical cycling and ecosystem function. However, how highly connected keystone species regulate associated microbial structure and function (of the whole community and of specialized species), irrespective of their abundance under land use change, remains unresolved. 2. Here, we identified the relationship between microbial diversity [soil phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) richness and composition, and ammonia-oxidizing archaea and bacteria (AOA and AOB) communities] with both a broad (i.e. microbial respiration) and specialized function (i.e. nitrification rate) in a woodland, shrubland and adjacent cropland in subtropical China. 3. Microbial respiration was significantly positively related to the microbial richness, but negatively correlated with the keystone species richness across different land use types. The relationships between biodiversity and the broad ecosystem function varied with land use, with a stronger relationship in the afforested land compared with in the cropland. In contrast to the broad function, land use did not significantly affect the specialized function, but the specialized function was positively related to AOA richness in the cropland. Additionally, the specialized function was predominately driven by the keystone species composition in AOA and AOB communities and indirectly regulated by soil environmental factors (particularly soil temperature) across land uses. 4. Overall, our results provide direct experimental insight into the mechanisms underlying the role of the keystone species in regulating below-ground ecosystem functions under land use change. In particular, our findings reveal that the broad function is maintained by the niche compensation effect, while the specialized function is maintained by the identity effect.","2021","MAR 2021","10.1111/1365-2435.13769","WOS:000627612100001"

However, slow growth of comammox bacteria makes it challenging to distinguish themfrom traditional ammonia oxidizing microorganisms. Genomic data indicated that comammox bacteria encoded genes that can metabolize urea and had higher nitrite tolerance, which could only be found in several ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). This implies that using nitrite and urea as nitrogen sources may accelerate comammox bacteria's enrichment efficiency. In this study, two reactors using nitrite and urea as substrates, respectively, were operated for 390 days. At the end of cultivation, the reactor fed with urea exhibited higher nitrification potential than the reactor fed with nitrite. Comammox bacteria outcompeted AOA and AOB, regardless of whether they were cultured with nitrite or urea. Using nitrite can improve the proportion of comammox amoA to total amoA of 92%, while using urea may increase the proportion of comammox bacteria among total bacteria to 14.2%. Metagenomic results implied that nitrite was converted to ammonia by nitrate reduction and absorbed by comammox bacteria. On the other hand, urea may be directly utilized as substrate. These results demonstrated that using different nitrogen sources caused niche differentiation of comammox bacteria, AOA, and AOB. Using nitrite can increase the relative abundance of comammox amoA to total amoA, while using urea can increase the quantity of comammox amoA. Comammox bacteriawere dominant among ammonia oxidizing microorganisms for both nitrite and urea cultures. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

To better understand soil ecosystem functioning, it is necessary to understand the responses of soil microbial diversity and community structure to changing climate, land cover, and associated environmental variables. With next-generation sequencing, we investigated changes in topsoil fungi community structure among different land cover types (from Forest to Cropland) and climate zones (from Hot to Cold zones) in the Western Pacific Region. We demonstrated that climate zones substantially (P = 0.001) altered the soil fungal beta-diversity (change in community composition), but not alpha-diversity (taxonomical diversity). In particular, precipitation, temperature, and also latitude were the best predictors of beta-diversity. Individual fungal classes displayed divergent but strong responses to climate variables and latitude, suggesting niche differentiation at lower taxonomic levels. We also demonstrated that fungal taxonomic diversity differentially responded to latitude across land covers: fungal diversity increased towards lower latitudes in the Forest and Cropland (R-2 = 0.19) but increased towards both lower and higher latitudes in Fallow land (R-2 = 0.45). Further, alpha-diversity was significantly influenced by soil pH in Forest (P = 0.02), and by diurnal temperature range in Fallow land and mean annual precipitation in Cropland. Collectively, various land cover types had differential influence on the latitude diversity gradient, while climate, and to some extent, edaphic variables, were crucial in shaping soil fungal community structure.

Niche differences at small scales (i.e., less than half a kilometer) best explained variation in fungal communities.

Plant microhabitat, rather than subspecies type, was the major driver shaping plant-associated bacterial microbiota. Deterministic processes were primarily responsible for community assembly in all microhabitats. The influence of vertical transmission from seed to root-associated bacterial communities appeared to be quite weak (endosphere) or even absent (rhizosphere). A core microbial community composed of 15 generalist species persisted across different microhabitats and represented key connectors in networks. Host-plant functional traits were linked to the relative abundance of these generalist core microbes and could be predicted from them using machine learning algorithms.

Using amoA genes as molecular markers, this study investigated the transcriptional abundance and community structure of active AOA and AOB in 14 WWTSs. Quantitative PCR results indicated that the transcriptional abundances of AOB amoA (averaged: 1.6 x 10(8) copies g(-1) dry sludge) were higher than those of AOA (averaged: 3.4 x 10(7) copies g(-1) dry sludge) in all WWTSs despite several higher abundances of AOA amoA at the gene level. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that Nitrosomonas europaea and unknown clusters accounted for 37.66% and 49.96% of the total AOB amoA transcripts, respectively, suggesting their dominant role in driving ammonia oxidation. Meanwhile, AOA amoA transcripts were only successfully retrieved from 3 samples, and the Nitrosospaera sister cluster dominated, accounting for 83.46%. Finally, the substrate utilization kinetics of different AOA and AOB species might play a fundamental role in shaping their niche differentiation, community composition, and functional activity.

Rice fields showed higher fungal richness in low latitude regions, consistent with latitudinal richness patterns found in natural terrestrial ecosystems; however, no such trend was observed in maize fields. Fungal richness was positively correlated with nutrient cycling in rice soils and fungal beta diversity with nutrient cycling in maize soils. These findings provide response thresholds for fungal community change across environmental gradients, advancing our understanding of soil fungal diversity patterns in agricultural ecosystems. Differences between wetland and dryland should be taken into consideration when formulating sustainable management plans and baselines for assessments of future global change and resilience of agricultural fields.

When applied to soil, N fertilizers are subject to nitrification, where NH3-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) oxidize NH3 to NO2-, NO2--oxidizing bacteria (NOB) oxidize NO2- to NO3-, and N oxides are produced from biotic and abiotic reactions. This study used soil microcosms to evaluate the properties of nitrification in response to the addition of N as digestate vs. NH4Cl in soils from the different climatic regions of the western Oregon coastal plain (CP) and eastern Oregon Columbia River basin (CRB). In each soil, properties of NH3 oxidation or N oxide accumulation did not differ when N was provided via digestate or NH4Cl over the normal temperature range; however, nitrification rates, communities, and products differed between soils. The average nitrification rate in CP soil was almost twofold higher than in CRB soil (P <= .001), despite no significant differences in AOB activity or AOB amoA copy numbers. With N addition, AOA activity also increased in CP soil, where AOA amoA copy numbers were fivefold higher than CRB soil (P < .002). Accumulation of NO2- only in CRB soil was likely due to NOB inhibition by high NH3 concentrations (similar to 560 mu M) present at the high pH of CRB soil (8.5). Overall, nitrification was dictated by differences in edaphic properties, temperature, and nitrifier communities more than N source.","2021","SEP 2021","10.1002/saj2.20325","WOS:000699975400001"

Comammox Nitrospira that can independently oxidize ammonia to nitrate have been found existing in various ecosystems except the ocean. Estuary tidal flat wetlands are an important transition area between land and sea. Thus, studying the species dynamics of comammox Nitrospira across the estuarine salinity gradient can offer insights into their ecological distribution and physiological potential in this ecosystem. Comammox Nitrospira species were widely distributed in the Yangtze Estuary, yet with abundance lower than canonical ammonia oxidizers. A distinct differentiation of comammox Nitrospira groups driven by salinity was revealed by phylogenetic and community structure analyses. Comammox Nitrospira clade A1 was mainly distributed in the downstream region of the Yangtze River indicating its high adaptation to salinity, while clade A2 was mostly detected in the upstream regions where salinity was low. Within the previously defined clade A2, a new subcluster-clade A2.2 was determined. It accounted for 19.2% of the retrieved comammox Nitrospira sequences from the samples, and showed similar sources and consistent niches with clade A1. In addition to salinity, ammonia, pH and particle size were also important environmental factors affecting niche differentiation of comammox Nitrospira species. Taken together, we surveyed the diversity, abundance, and community structure of comammox Nitrospira along the Yangtze Estuary, alongside the niche separation of different subgroups. This shed light on the ecophysiology of comammox in global estuary ecosystems.","2021","JUL 2021","10.1016/j.ibiod.2021.105286","WOS:000691429500006"

Their large-scale distribution patterns and the dominant environmental factors shaping their ecological niches are not yet well documented. Here, we investigated the biogeographic distribution of comammox Nitrospira over 4000 km in eastern Australia and explored the niche specialization of individual comammox Nitrospira phylotypes. Our results revealed that the abundance, richness and community composition of comammox Nitrospira clade A were best predicted by mean annual precipitation (MAP) among all the determined environmental parameters. We identified four phylogenetic clusters of comammox Nitrospira: clade A.1, A.2.1, A.2.2 and A.3. MAP was consistently the strongest factor correlated with the relative abundances of the dominant clades, A.2.1 and A.3. MAP and other variables including soil nitrate, mean annual temperature and total nitrogen showed contrasting effects on the relative abundances of comammox Nitrospira clade A.2.1 and A.3, indicating their potential ecological niche differentiation in the soils. Together, we found a broad distribution of comammox Nitrospira clade A, but not clade B, in various terrestrial ecosystems across eastern Australia, and the abundance and diversity of comammox Nitrospira clade A can be mainly predicted by MAP among all the determined environmental parameters.

Uredinia of a species of Uromycladium have been known on A. mearnsii in South Africa since the 1980s. However, the recent damage is associated with telia and spermogonia. Uredinia and telia were previously treated as conspecific with a phylogenetic species concept. However, uredinia did not form after previous artificial inoculation experiments with teliospores. Controlled studies identified the optimum conditions for basidiospore infection, but the optimum conditions for sporulation and dispersal have not been identified. To investigate the life cycle and field epidemiology of Uromycladium on A. mearnsii, spores were trapped weekly and development of disease symptoms and plant phenology were monitored monthly at three plantations. Telia and spermogonia developed independently from uredinia, and nucleotide polymorphisms between rDNA of uredinia and telia were fixed based on high throughput sequencing and PCRs. All three weather variables measured had a significant effect on teliospore abundance at two of the three sites. Teliospore abundance was greatest during trapping periods when mean relative humidity was high, mean rainfall was 4-5 mm day(-1) and mean temperature was 15-16 degrees C. Teliospore counts peaked at the end of summer, potentially the result of epidemic build-up. Results support the hypothesis that despite sharing a most recent common ancestor, uredinia on A. mearnsii in southern Africa are independent to the life cycle of the telial rust, which likely constitutes a new introduction. Furthermore, teliospores of U. acaciae disperse under wet conditions, and the wet season between October and March is the optimal period for wattle rust development.","2021","APR 2021","10.1111/aab.12677","WOS:000640252500001"

The bioreactor performance and microbiological properties were investigated under three different fluxes during a period of 160 days. Appreciable biomass aggregates were developed to enhance the nitrogen removal. Accordingly, proper turbidity (<= 1 NTU) and nitrogen removal were consistently achieved, in which the FTBR achieved nitrogen removal rates (NRRs) of 0.450 and 0.706 g-N/(L.d) under the nitrogen loading rates (NLRB) of 0.503 and 0.751 g-NAL.d), respectively. Nitrogen was removed after penetrating the biofilm, and a larger imposed flux on modules resulted in higher nitrogen removal due to the formation of different microenvironments. While the imposed flux increased, the relative abundances of the anammox group increased from 5.23% to 8.12%, whereas the ones of denitrifiers decreased and the ones of ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) did not change significantly. Of the two dominant anammox species, the abundance of Candidatus Kuenenia decreased, whereas the abundance of Candidatus Jettenia increased with increasing flux. Compared to the freely grown biofilm, bacterial communities of flow-through modules showed greater ecological niche differentiation and enhanced mass transport efficiency among species.

In this study, we hypothesized that AM fungal diversity and community composition in subtropical soils would display fundamental differences in their geographical patterns, shaped by spatial distance and land-use change, at local and regional scales. AM fungal community composition was examined by spore-based taxonomic analysis, using soil trap cultures. Acaulospora koskei and Glomus were found as generalists, regardless of mesoregions and land uses. Other Acaulospora species were also found generalists within mesoregions. Land-use change and intensification did not influence AM fungal composition, partially rejecting our first hypothesis. We then calculated the distance-decay of similarities among pairs of AM fungal communities and the distance-decay relationship within and over mesoregions. We also performed the Mantel test and redundancy analysis to discriminate the main environmental drivers of AM fungal diversity and composition turnover. Overall, we found significant distance-decays for all land uses. We also observed a distance-decay relationship within the mesoregion scale (< 104 km) and these changes were correlated mainly to soil type (not land use), with the secondary influence of both total organic carbon and clay contents. AM fungal species distribution presented significant distance-decays, regardless of land uses, which was indicative of dispersal limitation, a stochastic neutral process. Although, we found evidence that, coupled with dispersal limitation, niche differentiation also played a role in structuring AM fungal communities, driven by long-term historical contingencies, as represented by soil type, resulting from different soil origin and mineralogy across mesoregions.","2021","MAR 2021","10.1007/s00248-021-01721-y","WOS:000625027000002"

These bacteria are known to be primarily sulfur-oxidizing autotrophs that commonly occur in dense mats at redox interfaces. Their large size and the presence of a mucous sheath allows these cells to serve as sites of attachment for communities of other microorganisms. But little is known about their individual niche preferences and attached microbiomes, particularly in marine environments, due to a paucity of cultivars and their prevalence in habitats that are difficult to access and study. Therefore, in this study, we compare Beggiatoaceae strain composition, community composition, and geochemical profiles collected from sulfidic sediments at four marine stations off the coast of Namibia. To elucidate community members that were directly attached and enriched in both filamentous Beggiatoaceae, namely Ca. Marithioploca spp. and Ca. Maribeggiatoa spp., as well as non-filamentous Beggiatoaceae, Ca. Thiomargarita spp., the Beggiatoaceae were pooled by morphotype for community analysis. The Beggiatoaceae samples collected from a highly sulfidic site were enriched in strains of sulfur-oxidizing Campylobacterota, that may promote a more hospitable setting for the Beggiatoaceae, which are known to have a lower tolerance for high sulfide to oxygen ratios. We found just a few host-specific associations with the motile filamentous morphotypes. Conversely, we detected 123 host specific enrichments with non-motile chain forming Beggiatoaceae. Potential metabolisms of the enriched strains include fermentation of host sheath material, syntrophic exchange of H2 and acetate, inorganic sulfur metabolism, and nitrite oxidation. Surprisingly, we did not detect any enrichments of anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria as previously suggested and postulate that less well-studied anaerobic ammonium oxidation pathways may be occurring instead.","2021",NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0258124","WOS:000747234800007"

It is now becoming evident that restoring these altered food webs requires addressing not only ecological processes, but evolutionary ones as well, because human-induced rapid evolution may in turn affect ecological dynamics. We studied the potential for niche differentiation between different plate armor phenotypes in a rapidly expanding population of a small prey fish, the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). In the central Baltic Sea, three-spined stickleback abundance has increased dramatically during the past decades. The increase in this typical mesopredator has restructured near-shore food webs, increased filamentous algal blooms, and threatens coastal biodiversity. Time-series data covering 22 years show that the increase coincides with a decline in the number of juvenile perch (Perca fluviatilis), the most abundant predator of stickleback along the coast. We investigated the distribution of different stickleback plate armor phenotypes depending on latitude, environmental conditions, predator and prey abundances, nutrients, and benthic production; and described the stomach content of the stickleback phenotypes using metabarcoding. We found two distinct lateral armor plate phenotypes of stickleback, incompletely and completely plated. The proportion of incompletely plated individuals increased with increasing benthic production and decreasing abundances of adult perch. Metabarcoding showed that the stomach content of the completely plated individuals more often contained invertebrate herbivores (amphipods) than the incompletely plated ones. Since armor plates are defense structures favored by natural selection in the presence of fish predators, the phenotype distribution suggests that a novel low-predation regime favors stickleback with less armor. Our results suggest that morphological differentiation of the three-spined stickleback has the potential to affect food web dynamics and influence the persistence and resilience of the stickleback take-over in the Baltic Sea.","2021",NA,"10.1002/ecs2.3561","WOS:000667707100027"

Experiments simulating species loss from grassland have shown that losing biodiversity decreases ecosystem stability. However, as the originally sown experimental communities with reduced biodiversity develop, plant evolutionary processes or the assembly of interacting soil organisms may allow ecosystems to increase stability over time. We explored such effects in a long-term grassland biodiversity experiment with plant communities with either a history of co-occurrence (selected communities) or no such history (naive communities) over a 4-yr period in which a major flood disturbance occurred. Comparing communities of identical species composition, we found that selected communities had temporally more stable biomass than naive communities, especially at low species richness. Furthermore, selected communities showed greater biomass recovery after flooding, resulting in more stable post-flood productivity. In contrast to a previous study, the positive diversity-stability relationship was maintained after the flooding. Our results were consistent across three soil treatments simulating the presence or absence of co-selected microbial communities. We suggest that prolonged exposure of plant populations to a particular community context and abiotic site conditions can increase ecosystem temporal stability and resilience due to short-term evolution. A history of co-occurrence can in part compensate for species loss, as can high plant diversity in part compensate for the missing opportunity of such adaptive adjustments.","2021","OCT 2020","10.1002/ecy.3205","WOS:000583284700001"

This study was conducted to examine As-transforming microbes and As-speciation in the rice rhizosphere compartments, in response to two different water management practices (continuous and intermittently flooded), established on fields with high to low soil-As concentration. Microbial functional gene composition in the rhizosphere and root-plaque compartments were characterized using the GeoChip 4.0 microarray. Arsenic speciation and concentrations were analyzed in the rhizosphere soil, root-plaque, pore water, and grain samples. Results confirmed several As-biotransformation processes in the rice rhizosphere compartments, and distinct assemblage of As-reducing and methylating bacteria was observed between the root-plaque and rhizosphere. Results confirmed higher potential for microbial As-reduction and As-methylation in continuously flooded, long term As-contaminated fields, which accumulated highest concentrations of As-III and methyl-As concentrations in pore water and rice grains. Water management treatment significantly altered As-speciation in the rhizosphere, and intermittent flooding reduced methyl-As and As-III concentrations in the pore water, root-plaque and rice grain. Ordination and taxonomic analysis of detected gene-probes indicated that root-plaque and rhizosphere assembled significantly different microbial functional groups demonstrating niche separation. Taxonomic non-redundancy was evident, suggesting that As-reduction, -oxidation and -methylation processes were performed by different microbial functional groups. It was also evident that As transformation was coupled to different biogeochemical cycling processes (nutrient assimilation, carbon metabolism etc.) in the compartments and between treatments, revealing functional non-redundancy of rice-rhizosphere microbiome in response to local biogeochemical conditions and As contamination.

Here we investigate what factors drive diversification in two tropical, morphologically similar macrolichens that occupy a similar range but differ in altitudinal and habitat preferences, testing for isolation by distance (IBD), environment (IBE), and fragmentation (IBF). Location: Neotropics, Hawaii, Macaronesia. Taxon: Sticta andina, S. scabrosa (Peltigeraceae). Methods: We analysed 395 specimens from 135 localities, using the fungal ITS barcoding marker to assess phylogenetic diversification, through maximum likelihood tree reconstruction, TCS haplotype networks, and Tajima's D. Mantel tests were employed to detect structure in genetic vs. geographic, environmental, and fragmentation distances. Habitat preferences were quantitatively assessed by statistical analysis of locality-based BIOclim variables. Results: Sticta andina exhibited high phenotypic variation and reticulate phylogenetic diversity across its range, whereas the phenotypically uniform S. scabrosa contained two main haplotypes, one unique to Hawaii. Sticta andina is restricted to well-preserved andine forests and paramos, naturally fragmented habitats due to disruptive topology, whereas S. scabrosa thrives in lowland to lower montane zones in exposed or disturbed microsites, representing a continuous habitat. Sticta scabrosa showed IBD only across its full range (separating the Hawaiian population) but not within continental Central and South America, there exhibiting a negative Tajima's D. Sticta andina did not exhibit IBD but IBE at continental level and IBF in the northern Andes. Main conclusions: Autecology, particularly preference for either low or high altitudes, indirectly drives phylogenetic diversification. Low diversification in the low altitude species, S. scabrosa, can be attributed to rapid expansion and effective gene flow across a more or less continuous niche due to disturbance tolerance. In contract, high diversification in the high altitude species, S. andina, can be explained by niche differentiation (IBE) and fragmentation (IBF) caused by the Andean uplift.","2021","JAN 2021","10.1111/jbi.14033","WOS:000605449200001"

Here, the performance of partial nitritation process under mainstream conditions was investigated based on the change of the nitrifying community developed. A lab-scale airlift reactor was operated for 430 days with a granular sludge highly enriched in ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) performing partial nitritation treating a mainstream-mimicked synthetic influent. The changes in solid retention time (SRT), dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration and temperature strongly affected to the microbial community developed, especially to the dynamics of the nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) population, which triggered to instabilities in the partial nitritation process. The extremely high values of SRT applied (SRT = infinity) and long-term exposure to low temperature (10 degrees C) promoted the growth of NOB Nitrotoga genus and development of nitratation activity; and the subsequent variability in temperature (between 10 and 30 degrees C) and in DO concentration (between 0.4 + 0.1 and 1.4 +/- 0.3 mg O-2 L-1) influenced the competitiveness between nitrifiers and the growth of species previously undetected in the culture, as Nitrospira genus. Anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria were also identified during cultivation and assisted to the repression of the NOB activity at 25-15 degrees C.

For example, cyanobacteria with phycobilisomes as light-harvesting antennae can effectively utilize green or orange-red light. However, recent studies show that they use blue light much less efficiently than phytoplankton species with chlorophyll-based light-harvesting complexes, even though both phytoplankton groups may absorb blue light to a similar extent. Can we advance ecological theory to predict how these differences in light-harvesting strategy affect competition between phytoplankton species? Here, we develop a new resource competition model in which the absorption and utilization efficiency of different colors of light are varied independently. The model was parameterized using monoculture experiments with a freshwater cyanobacterium and green alga, as representatives of phytoplankton with phycobilisome-based vs. chlorophyll-based light-harvesting antennae. The parameterized model was subsequently tested in a series of competition experiments. In agreement with the model predictions, the green alga won the competition in blue light whereas the cyanobacterium won in red light, irrespective of the initial relative abundances of the species. These results are in line with observed changes in phytoplankton community structure in response to lake brownification. Similarly, in marine waters, the model predicts dominance of Prochlorococcus with chlorophyll-based light-harvesting complexes in blue light but dominance of Synechococcus with phycobilisomes in green light, with a broad range of coexistence in between. These predictions agree well with the known biogeographical distributions of these two highly abundant marine taxa.

Results showed that trees, shrubs and herbs all preferred to take up NH4+ over NO3- and glycine, likely due to the dominant available N form in native soils. Species coexisting in the subtropical plantation did not show chemical niche differentiation, but there was a temporal niche separation in N acquisition across plant species. Absorptive roots with higher mycorrhizal colonization rates exhibited higher N uptake rates than those with lower colonization. In May, morphological traits (diameter and root tissue density) seemed playing important roles in N acquisition on that the absorptive roots with larger diameter and shorter specific root length (SRL) showed higher uptake rates for NH4+, NO3-, and glycine than those with smaller diameter and longer SRL. While in August, the architectural traits of root branching might be essential to enhance nutrient absorption on that the absorptive roots with intensive branching exhibited higher N uptake rates than those with less branching.

In this study, we report the isolation, physiology, and genome of a novel nitrite-oxidizingNitrospirastrain isolated from a fixed-bed column at a drinking water treatment plant. Continuous feeding of ammonia led to the enrichment ofNitrospira-like cells, as well as members of ammonia-oxidizing genusNitrosomonas. Subsequently, a microcolony sorting technique was used to isolate a novel nitrite-oxidizingNitrospirastrain. Sequences of strains showing the growth of microcolonies in microtiter plates were checked. Consequently, the most abundant operational taxonomic unit (OTU) exhibited high sequence similarity withNitrospira japonica(98%) at the 16S rRNA gene level. The two otherNitrospiraOTUs shared over 99% sequence similarities withN. japonicaandNitrospirasp. strain GC86.

The half saturation constant for nitrite and the maximum nitrite oxidation rate of strain KM1 were orders of magnitude lower than the published data of other knownNitrospirastrains; moreover, strain KM1 was more sensitive to free ammonia compared with previously isolatedNitrospirastrains. Therefore, the newNitrospirastrain appears to be better adapted to oligotrophic environments compared with other known non-marine nitrite oxidizers. The complete genome of strain KM1 was 4,509,223 bp in length and contained 4,318 predicted coding sequences.

A. tequilana showed a depletion in several genes belonging to carbon metabolism, secondary metabolite biosynthesis and xenobiotic degradation suggesting that its lower microbial diversity might be linked to functional losses. However, this species also showed an enrichment in biofilm and quorum sensing in the epiphytic compartments, and evidence for nitrogen fixation in the rhizosphere. Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic markers were represented by Rhizobiales (Methylobacterium) and Rhodospirillales (Belnapia) in the phyllosphere, while photosystem genes were widespread in Bacillales and Cyanobacteria. Nitrogen fixation and biofilm formation genes were mostly related to Proteobacteria. These analyses support the idea of niche differentiation in the rhizosphere and phyllosphere of agaves and cacti and shed light on the potential mechanisms by which epiphytic microbial communities survive and colonize plants of arid and semiarid ecosystems. This study establishes a guideline for testing the relevance of the identified functional traits on the microbial community and the plant fitness.","2020",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2019.03044","WOS:000510719500001"
"Krueger-Hadfield, SA","What's ploidy got to do with it? Understanding the evolutionary ecology of macroalgal invasions necessitates incorporating life cycle complexity","EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS","Biological invasions represent grave threats to terrestrial, aquatic, and marine ecosystems, but our understanding of the role of evolution during invasions remains rudimentary. In marine environments, macroalgae account for a large percentage of invaders, but their complicated life cycles render it difficult to move methodologies and predictions wholesale from species with a single, free-living ploidy stage, such as plants or animals. In haplodiplontic macroalgae, meiosis and fertilization are spatiotemporally separated by long-lived, multicellular haploid and diploid stages, and gametes are produced by mitosis, not meiosis. As a consequence, there are unique eco-evolutionary constraints that are not typically considered in invasions. First, selfing can occur in both monoicious (i.e., hermaphroditic) and dioicious (i.e., separate sexes) haplodiplontic macroalgae. In the former, fertilization between gametes produced by the same haploid thallus results in instantaneous, genome-wide homozygosity. In the latter, cross-fertilization between separate male and female haploids that share the same diploid parent is analogous to selfing in plants or animals. Separate sexes, therefore, cannot be used as a proxy for outcrossing. Second, selfing likely facilitates invasions (i.e., Baker's law) and the long-lived haploid stage may enable purging of deleterious mutations, further contributing to invasion success. Third, asexual reproduction will result in the dominance of one ploidy and/or sex and the loss of the other(s). Whether or not sexual reproduction can be recovered depends on which stage is maintained. Finally, fourth, haplodiplontic life cycles are predicted to be maintained through niche differentiation in the haploid and diploid stages. Empirical tests are rare, but fundamental to our understanding of macroalgal invasion dynamics. By highlighting these four phenomena, we can build a framework with which to empirically and theoretically address important gaps in the literature on marine evolutionary ecology, of which biological invasions can serve as unnatural laboratories.","2020","AUG 2019","10.1111/eva.12843","WOS:000479065900001"

Although protists play an important ecological role in marine ecosystems, the response of the protist community to ARs is still poorly understood. In the current study, an Illumina sequencing analysis of 18S rDNA was performed, and the diversity, community structure, and co-occurrence networks of protists in the ARs and open sea area (OW) in Daya Bay were described. The results indicated that significant seasonal differences occur in the seawater protists between the surface and bottom of the ARs and OW. However, the protists in the ARs and OW had different seasonal variations. The ARs always affected the alpha diversity of marine protists in different seasons, while the surface and bottom OW sites had different seasonal effects. The ARs sites had different effects on the community composition of the surface and bottom seawater in different seasons relative to the OW sites. The linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (IEfSe) method showed that 85 biomarkers mainly belonging to 11 taxa, including Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta, and Dinophyceae, were affected by the ARs (P < 0.05, LDA > 2.0). The ARs played an important role in the seasonal changes in the protist community composition and had different effects on the dominant species of protists in the surface and bottom seawater. A redundancy analysis (RDA) significance test showed that the structure of the protist community in Daya Bay was mainly affected by environmental factors, such as seawater temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen. Compared with the OW group, the surface and bottom layers of the ARs had more complex protist interactions or more niches. The ARs increased the degree of spatial heterogeneity, which may lead to significant niche differentiation, indicating that ARs as habitat factors affect the complexity and stability of the symbiotic network of protists. The results could provide basic data on the response of the protist community to the ARs in Daya Bay and a reference for assessments of the impact of ARs on the ecological environment.

Exotic plants can have shallower roots than native species, so their impact on microorganisms is anticipated to change with depth. Using environmental DNA and extracellular enzymatic activities, we studied fungal and bacterial community composition, diversity, function, and co-occurrence networks between native and exotic grasslands at soil depths up to 1 m. We hypothesized (1) the composition and network structure of both fungal and bacterial communities will change with increasing depth, and diversity and enzymatic function will decrease; (2) microbial enzymatic function and network connectedness will be lower in exotic grasslands; and (3) irrigation will alter microbial networks, increasing the overall connectedness. Microbial diversity decreased with depth, and community composition was distinctly different between shallow and deeper soil depths with higher numbers of unknown taxa in lower soil depths. Fungal communities differed between native and exotic plant communities. Microbial community networks were strongly shaped by biotic and abiotic factors concurrently and were the only microbial measurement affected by irrigation. In general, fungal communities were more connected in native plant communities than exotic, especially below 10 cm. Fungal networks were also more connected at lower soil depths albeit with fewer nodes. Bacterial communities demonstrated higher complexity, and greater connectedness and nodes, at lower soil depths for native plant communities. Exotic plant communities' bacterial network connectedness altered at lower soil depths dependent on irrigation treatments. Microbial extracellular enzyme activity for carbon cycling enzymes significantly declined with soil depth, but enzymes associated with nitrogen and phosphorus cycling continued to have similar activities up to 1 m deep. Our results indicate that native and exotic grasslands have significantly different fungal communities in depths up to 1 m and that both fungal and bacterial networks are strongly shaped jointly by plant communities and abiotic factors. Soil depth is independently a major determinant of both fungal and bacterial community structures, functions, and co-occurrence networks and demonstrates further the importance of including soil itself when investigating plant-microbe interactions.","2020",NA,"10.1002/ecs2.2973","WOS:000533913600002"

However, the bacterial communities in the sediment of the Yangtze River and the influence of the synergistic effect of geographical characteristics and anthropogenic activities remain poorly understood. To analyze the bacterial community compositions and determine the driving factors that cause the niche segregation of the bacterial assembly, samples located along the Yangtze River were analyzed using Illumina Miseq sequencing. Based on the results, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Chloroflexi were identified as dominant phyla, and Alphaproteobacteria was the most dominant subdivision. The bacterial diversity was most significantly correlated with elevation (p < 0.01), followed by urbanization rate (p < 0.01), and organic matter (p < 0.05). A decreasing trend of bacterial diversity was found along the elevation and a threshold of 400 masl was observed with regard to the bacterial richness and community compositions in response to elevation gradient. Above 400 masl, the bacterial richness was closely associated with elevation gradient, followed by total phosphorus and total nitrogen, while below 400 masl elevation, urbanization rate and Cu were dominant variables. Redundancy analysis indicated that bacterial community compositions were mostly related to the input of organic matter (20.0%, p = 0.001), followed by elevation (10.4%, p = 0.003), urbanization rate (9.0%, p = 0.017) and Pb (9.5%, p = 0.026). Distance-decay correlation analysis also showed that the variations of bacterial community structures were significantly positively correlated with elevation and organic matter. Based on the results of the meta-community, in general, the altitudinal gradient exerted a more notable influence than anthropogenic disturbance on bacterial communities. However, increased concentrated anthropogenic exploitation and interference might contribute more to deterministic processes driven by competition and niche differentiation of bacterial community structures in the sediment of the Yangtze River along the elevation gradient.","2020",NA,"10.5004/dwt.2020.24875","WOS:000544993600012"

Hawkfishes in the genus Paracirrhites are a unique taxon to explore with respect to niche differentiation, exhibiting diagnostic differences in coloration, and an apparent center of distribution outside of the Indo-Malay-Philippine (IMP) biodiversity hotspot for coral reef fishes. Our aim is to use next-generation sequencing methods to leverage samples of a taxon at their center of maximum diversity to explore phylogenetic relationships and a possible mechanism of coexistence. Location Flint Island, Southern Line Islands, Republic of Kiribati. Methods A comprehensive review of museum records, the primary literature, and unpublished field survey records was undertaken to determine ranges for four arc-eye hawkfish species in the Paracirrhites species complex and a potential hybrid. Fish from four Paracirrhites species were collected from Flint Island in the Southern Line Islands, Republic of Kiribati. Hindgut contents were sequenced, and subsequent metagenomic analyses were used to assess the phylogenetic relatedness of the host fish, the microbiome community structure, and prey remains for each species. Results Phylogenetic analyses conducted with recovered mitochondrial genomes revealed clustering of P. bicolor with P. arcatus and P. xanthus with P. nisus, which were unexpected on the basis of previous morphological work in this species complex. Differences in taxonomic composition of gut microbial communities and presumed prey remains indicate likely separation of foraging niches. Main Conclusions Our findings point toward previously unidentified relationships in this cryptic species complex at its proposed center of distribution. The three species endemic to the Polynesian province (P. nisus, P. xanthus, and P. bicolor) cluster separately from the more broadly distributed P. arcatus on the basis of relative abundance of metazoan sequences in the gut (presumed prey remains). Discordance between gut microbial communities and phylogeny of the host fish further reinforce the hypothesis of niche separation.","2020",NA,"10.1002/ece3.6138","WOS:000524417200022"

Observed differences in winter versus summer microbial taxonomic composition also suggests that phylogenetically conserved traits may permit winter- versus summer-adapted microorganisms to occupy distinct niches. In this study, we sought to identify archaea, bacteria, and fungi that are associated with the soil microbial bloom overwinter and the subsequent biomass collapse following snowmelt at a high-altitude watershed in central Colorado, United States. Archaea, bacteria, and fungi were categorized into three life strategies (Winter-Adapted, Snowmelt-Specialist, Spring-Adapted) based upon changes in abundance during winter, the snowmelt period, and after snowmelt in spring. We calculated indices of phylogenetic relatedness (archaea and bacteria) or assigned functional attributes (fungi) to organisms within life strategies to infer whether phylogenetically conserved traits differentiate Winter-Adapted, Snowmelt-Specialist, and Spring-Adapted groups. We observed that the soil microbial bloom was correlated in time with a pulse of snowmelt infiltration, which commenced 65 days prior to soils becoming snow-free. A pulse of nitrogen (N, as nitrate) occurred after snowmelt, along with a collapse in the microbial biomass pool size, and an increased abundance of nitrifying archaea and bacteria (e.g., Thaumarchaeota, Nitrospirae). Winter- and Spring-Adapted archaea and bacteria were phylogenetically clustered, suggesting that phylogenetically conserved traits allow Winter- and Spring-Adapted archaea and bacteria to occupy distinct niches. In contrast, Snowmelt-Specialist archaea and bacteria were phylogenetically overdispersed, suggesting that the key mechanism(s) of the microbial biomass crash are likely to be density-dependent (e.g., trophic interactions, competitive exclusion) and affect organisms across a broad phylogenetic spectrum. Saprotrophic fungi were the dominant functional group across fungal life strategies, however, ectomycorrhizal fungi experienced a large increase in abundance in spring. If well-coupled plant-mycorrhizal phenology currently buffers ecosystem N losses in spring, then changes in snowmelt timing may alter ecosystem N retention potential. Overall, we observed that snowmelt separates three distinct soil niches that are occupied by ecologically distinct groups of microorganisms. This ecological differentiation is of biogeochemical importance, particularly with respect to the mobilization of nitrogen during winter, before and after snowmelt.","2020",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2020.00871","WOS:000538391100001"

Anaerobic storage effectively preserved biomass with minimal degradation of carbohydrates and preservation of lipids and proteins. Screening experiments identified optimal pretreatment conditions for stored biomass. Scale-up of pretreatment enabled fermentation of the hydrolysate to butyric acid and indicated no observable difference in conversion between unstored and stored biomass.

Longitudinal within-host population dynamics, evolution, and adaptation during a chronic >16-year Burkholderia pseudomallei infection","PLOS PATHOGENS","Although acute melioidosis is the most common outcome of Burkholderia pseudomallei infection, we have documented a case, P314, where disease severity lessened with time, and the pathogen evolved towards a commensal relationship with the host. In the current study, we used whole-genome sequencing to monitor this long-term symbiotic relationship to better understand B. pseudomallei persistence in P314's sputum despite intensive initial therapeutic regimens. We collected and sequenced 118 B. pseudomallei isolates from P314's airways over a >16-year period, and also sampled the patient's home environment, recovering six closely related B. pseudomallei isolates from the household water system. Using comparative genomics, we identified 126 SNPs in the core genome of the 124 isolates or 162 SNPs/indels when the accessory genome was included. The core SNPs were used to construct a phylogenetic tree, which demonstrated a close relationship between environmental and clinical isolates and detailed within-host evolutionary patterns. The phylogeny had little homoplasy, consistent with a strictly clonal mode of genetic inheritance. Repeated sampling revealed evidence of genetic diversification, but frequent extinctions left only one successful lineage through the first four years and two lineages after that. Overall, the evolution of this population is nonadaptive and best explained by genetic drift. However, some genetic and phenotypic changes are consistent with in situ adaptation. Using a mouse model, P314 isolates caused greatly reduced morbidity and mortality compared to the environmental isolates. Additionally, potentially adaptive phenotypes emerged and included differences in the O-antigen, capsular polysaccharide, motility, and colony morphology. The >13-year co-existence of two long-lived lineages presents interesting hypotheses that can be tested in future studies to provide additional insights into selective pressures, niche differentiation, and microbial adaptation. This unusual melioidosis case presents a rare example of the evolutionary progression towards commensalism by a highly virulent pathogen within a single human host. Author summary Pathogens frequently jump between different hosts, and associated adaptation may lead to the emergence of new infectious agents. Such host-jumping evolution is witnessed through endpoint analyses but these cannot capture genetic changes in lineages that have gone extinct. In this study, we have identified and monitored an example of the evolution of a bacterium often deadly to its mammalian host, in an unprecedented case whereby disease lessened through time and the pathogen became a part of the commensal human flora. We used genomic analyses to characterize more than 16 years of this evolutionary process and the stepwise mutations that control pathogen interactions with the patient. Soon after infection, mutational changes occurred that allowed the bacterium to remain in the airways without causing disease. This shift towards avirulence was determined based on clinical data and virulence testing in an animal model. In addition, mutations occurred that contributed to the persistence of the bacteria in the patient's lungs. Finally, we found evidence for the evolutionary emergence and persistence of two distinct lineages of the bacterium over the last 13 years, presenting interesting questions about niche utilization. Bacteria are ubiquitous in the human body and almost all are beneficial or benign. In this study, we document the evolutionary conversion of a normally deadly bacterium towards a commensal.","2020",NA,"10.1371/journal.ppat.1008298","WOS:000523706200011"

The harvested hardy kiwifruit generally showed an increase in soluble solids content, a decrease in firmness, and deterioration of fruit quality as they ripened, regardless of the storage regime. The firmness of 'Cheongsan', 'Daebo', and 'Daeseong' was 19.9, 20.5, and 33.9 N at harvest, respectively, and decreased to 5.0 N in 'Cheongsan' and 'Daebo' after 5 days of shelf life.

C-ISS includes gate-to-source capacitance (C-GS) and gate-to-drain capacitance (C-GD). In comparison with the normally-on HEMTs, it is found that the phenomenon of C-ISS variation is different in the commercial p-GaN gate HEMTs. The unique charge storage effect in the typical p-GaN layer is adopted and discussed to explain the variation of C-ISS and establish the underlying mechanism. Owing to the depletion of holes, net negative charges are induced in the p-GaN layer under an off-state drain bias. It is demonstrated that the negative charge storage makes significant contribution to the increase of C-GS before the two-dimensional-electron-gas channel under source-field-plate (SFP) pinches off. Due to the clamped electric field distributions at drain-side edge of the p-GaN layer, the charge storage stops changing C-GS after the SFP pinche-off. Additionally, the storage has a minor influence on the variation of C-GD.

While coral loss frequently triggers changes in coral reef fish assemblage structure, the ecosystem-scale consequences of these changes are poorly known. Here we evaluate how four metrics of energy flow and storage that underscore a critical coral reef function, consumer biomass production, respond to severe coral loss on a coral reef in the northern Great Barrier Reef, Australia. We compared fish and benthic surveys at Lizard Island from 2003 to 2004 with surveys in 2018 using an individual-level modelling approach that integrates growth and mortality coefficients to estimate community-level standing biomass, productivity, consumed biomass and turnover. In the study period, coral cover declined by 72%-83% in forereef zones while turf cover increased by 18%-100% across all zones. Reef fish assemblages, in turn, responded with a 71% increase in standing biomass, 41% in productivity and 37% in consumed biomass, mainly driven by nominally-herbivorous fishes (Labridae-Scarini, Acanthuridae and Siganidae). By contrast, biomass turnover rates declined by 19%. Our findings suggest that coral loss can drive energetic shifts on coral reefs, leading to more productive, but slower paced reef fish assemblages. Although the observed build-up of biomass may appear positive, the decreased turnover rates indicate that the system is unable to maintain biomass replacement levels. This suggests that the enhanced productivity that accompanied coral loss may be driven by storage effects from the somatic growth of individuals already present, questioning the temporal stability of these changes to coral reef ecosystem functioning.

Lactic acid bacteria, yeast, and total viable bacteria counts of samples stored at 35C were reduced sharply, whereas other parameters were stable. Compared with refrigerated storage (4C), higher storage temperatures (25 and 35C) accelerated moisture migration, lipid oxidation, and proteolytic degradation.

Refrigerated storage was better than higher storage temperatures (25 and 35C) for maintaining the odor quality of Suanyu during the storage period. Total biogenic amine concentrations in all samples were << 200 mg/kg. Suanyu can be consumed safely during 90 days of storage based on the levels of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria and concentrations of biogenic amines, but refrigerated storage effectively slows down the microbial and physicochemical changes, resulting in better organoleptic quality.

The bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity of OJ decreased with storage, while the pectin methyl esterase (PME) increased. Nonetheless, noticeable changes were observed from the 12th day of storage. There was no obvious (p > 0.05) variation in pH and total soluble solids. To determine the nutritional and microbial quality characteristics of OJ during storage, non-linear kinetic curves were successfully fitted with least square fitting polynomial and four-parameter log-logistic distribution models. The E-nose sensors succeeded in discriminating between the aroma of non-treated and treated OJ based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Furthermore, terpenes, alcohol and partially aromatic compounds were the main spoilage indicators of OJ during storage based on E-nose analysis and confirmed by HS-SPME-GC/MS analysis. Thus, MTS significantly extended the shelf life of the quality quartet of natural OJ at 4 degrees C. E-nose-GC/MS fusion offered odor fingerprints to AAT microorganisms that can be used as spoilage index without using traditional food analysis techniques. The proposed approach can be used as an alternative tool for rapid detection of spoilage microorganisms in OJ.","2020",NA,"10.1016/j.ultsonch.2020.104982","WOS:000532044300058"
"Conte, P; Fadda, C; Del Caro, A; Urgeghe, PP; Piga, A","Table Olives: An Overview on Effects of Processing on Nutritional and Sensory Quality","FOODS","Table olives are a pickled food product obtained by a partial/total debittering and subsequent fermentation of drupes. Their peculiar sensory properties have led to a their widespread use, especially in Europe, as an appetizer or an ingredient for culinary use. The most relevant literature of the last twenty years has been analyzed in this review with the aim of giving an up-to-date overview of the processing and storage effects on the nutritional and sensory properties of table olives. Analysis of the literature has revealed that the nutritional properties of table olives are mainly influenced by the processing method used, even if preharvest-factors such as irrigation and fruit ripening stage may have a certain weight. Data revealed that the nutritional value of table olives depends mostly on the balanced profile of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and the contents of health-promoting phenolic compounds, which are best retained in natural table olives. Studies on the use of low salt brines and of selected starter cultures have shown the possibility of producing table olives with an improved nutritional profile. Sensory characteristics are mostly process-dependent, and a relevant contribute is achieved by starters, not only for reducing the bitterness of fruits, but also for imparting new and typical taste to table olives. Findings reported in this review confirm, in conclusion, that table olives surely constitute an important food source for their balanced nutritional profile and unique sensory characteristics.","2020",NA,"10.3390/foods9040514","WOS:000537220500145"

This study evaluated the reproductive capability and viability of P. citricarpa under simulated conditions in which the whole fruit, peel segments, or citrus pulp with CBS lesions were discarded. Naturally infected 'Midknight' Valencia orange and 'Eureka' lemon fruit, either treated using standard postharvest sanitation, fungicide, and wax coating treatments or untreated, were placed into cold storage for 5 weeks (oranges at 4 degrees C and lemons at 7 degrees C). Thereafter, treated and untreated fruit were incubated for a further 2 weeks at conditions conducive for CBS symptom expression and formation of pycnidia. The ability of pycnidia to secrete viable pycnidiospores after whole fruit and peel segments or peel pieces from citrus pulp were exposed to sunlight at warm temperatures (+/- 28 degrees C) and +/- 75% relative humidity levels was then investigated. The combination of postharvest treatments and cold storage effectively controlled CBS latent infections (>83.6% control) and pycnidium formation (<1.4% of lesions formed pycnidia), and the wax coating completely inhibited pycnidiospore release in fruit and peel segments. Pycnidiospores were secreted only from lesions on untreated fruit and peel segments and at low levels (4.3-8.6%) from peel pieces from pulped treated fruit. However, spore release rapidly declined when exposed to sunlight conditions (1.4% and 0% after 2 and 3 days, respectively). The generally poor reproductive ability and viability of CBS fruit lesions on harvested fruit, particularly when exposed to sunlight conditions, supports the conclusion that citrus fruit without leaves is not an epidemiologically significant pathway for the entry, establishment, and spread of P. citricarpa.","2020",NA,"10.3390/plants9121813","WOS:000602541500001"

The tribological and mechanical properties of composites with different DE contents and varying cold-pressed pressures were investigated systematically. Due to the oil storage effect of DE particles, the maximum oil content of PTFE/DE composite is 16.4 wt%. With the increase of DE content, the surface hardness, elastic modulus and yield strength can be increased from 3.2 to 3.6 HV, 37.8-60.2 MPa and 8.7 MPa-12.8 MPa, respectively. With the addition of DE, the wear rate of PTFE decreases but the coefficient of friction (COF) increases. Meanwhile, with the addition of DE and ATF6, both the COF and wear rate of PTFE decrease. The COF can be reduced by 68% from 0.121 (specimen 0%-10 MPa-dry) to the minimum value of 0.039 (composite 10%-10 MPa-ATF6), and the wear rate can be reduced by 82% from 1.95 x 10(-4) mm/Nm (0%-50 MPa-dry) to the minimum value of 0.35 x 10(-4) mm/Nm (10%-50 MPa-ATF6). The enhanced antifriction performance of the composite PTFE/DE/ATF6 is contributed by the synergistic lubricating effect of self-contained liquid lubricant of ATF6 and the solid lubricant of PTFE. The prepared PTFE/DE/ATF6 composites exhibit excellent tribological performance as well as the mechanical properties, which can be used to fabricate a new kind of self-lubricating materials with high performance and long durability.","2020",NA,"10.1016/j.coco.2020.100513","WOS:000604633000007"

Results of individual diagnostic test accuracy studies assessing the diagnostic value of pancreatic autoantibodies-to-glycoprotein-2 (anti-GP2) tests for the diagnosis of CD appear promising. AIM To systematically review and meta-analyze evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of anti-GP2 tests in patients with suspected/confirmed CD. METHODS An electronic search was conducted on PubMed, Cochrane-CENTRAL and grey literature (CRD42019125947). The structured research question in PICPTR format was Population including patients with symptoms akin to CD, the Index test being anti-GP2 testing, the Comparator involved standard CD diagnosis, the Purpose of test being diagnostic, Target disorder was CD, and the Reference standard included standard clinical, radiological, endoscopical, and histological CD diagnostic criteria. Quality was assessed with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool and hierarchical models were employed to synthesize the data. RESULTS Out of 722 studies retrieved, 15 were meta-analyzed. Thirteen studies had industry-related conflicts-of-interest, and most included healthy donors as controls (spectrum bias). For the combination of IgA and/or IgG anti-GP2 test, the summary sensitivity was 20% (95% confidence interval: 10%-29%) at a median specificity of 97%. If the test was applied in 10000 suspected patients, 9669 would be true negatives and in 26, the diagnosis would be missed. In this hypothetical cohort, the anti-GP2 would fail to produce a diagnosis for 81.3% of the positive cases. Low summary points of sensitivity and high specificity were estimated for the IgG or IgA anti-GP2 test. Analogous results were observed when the analyses were restricted using specific cut-offs, or when ulcerative colitis patients were used as comparators. CONCLUSION Anti-GP2 tests demonstrate low sensitivity and high specificity. These results indicate that caution is required before relying on its diagnostic value. Additionally, the need for improving the methodology of diagnostic test accuracy studies is evident.","2020",NA,"10.3748/wjg.v26.i2.246","WOS:000536254000008"

Differences in response to AM fungi may affect competition between plant species, influencing their ability to coexist. We hypothesized that positively responding species, whose growth is stimulated by AM fungi, will experience stronger intraspecific competition and weaker interspecific competition in soil containing AM fungi, while neutrally or negatively responding species should experience weaker intraspecific and stronger interspecific competition. We grew Plantago lanceolata, which responds positively to AM fungi, and Bromus inermis, which responds negatively to AM fungi, in an additive response surface competition experiment that varied the total density and relative frequency of each species. Plants were grown in sterilized background soil that had been inoculated with whole soil biota, which includes AM fungi, or a microbial wash, that contained other soil microbes but no AM fungi, or in sterilized soil that contained no biota. The positively responding P. lanceolata was more strongly limited by intraspecific than interspecific competition when AM fungi were present. By contrast, the presence of AM fungi decreased the strength of intraspecific competition experienced by the negatively responding B. inermis. Because AM fungi are almost always present in soil, strong intraspecific competition in positively responding species would prevent them from outcompeting species that respond neutrally or negatively to AM fungi. The potential for increased intraspecific competition to offset growth benefits of AM fungi could, therefore, be a stabilizing mechanism that promotes coexistence among plant species.","2020",NA,"10.1007/s00442-020-04609-9","WOS:000518484400015"

Activity improvement of these enzymes via rational design is a promising strategy to alleviate the industrial costs, but it requires detailed structural knowledge. While substantial biochemical and structural data are available for GH7 cellobiohydrolases, endoglucanases are more elusive and only few structures have been solved so far. Here, we report a new crystal structure and biochemical characterization of a thermostable endoglucanase from the thermophilic ascomycete Rasamsonia emersonii, ReCel7B. The enzyme was compared with the homologous endoglucanase from the mesophilic model ascomycete Trichoderma reesei (TrCel7B), which unlike ReCel7B possesses an additional carbohydrate-binding module (CBM). With a temperature optimum of 80 degrees C, ReCel7B displayed a number of differences in activity and ability to synergize with cellobiohydrolases compared to TrCel7B. We improved both binding and kinetics in a chimeric variant of ReCel7B and a CBM, while we observe the opposite effect when the CBM was removed in TrCel7B. The crystal structure of ReCel7B was determined at 2.48 angstrom resolution, with R-work and R-free factors of 0.182 and 0.206, respectively. Structural analyses revealed that ReCel7B has increased rigidity in a number of peripheral loops compared to TrCel7B and fewer aromatics in the substrate-binding cleft. An increased number of glycosylations were identified in ReCel7B, and we propose a stabilizing mechanism for one of the glycans.

The direction of C stabilization in paddies can, however, deviate from that in upland soils owing to i) periodic drying-rewetting cycles, with oxygen pulses under oxic conditions, and thus, shifts in microbial processing of organic residues, and ii) intensive organic and mineral fertilization. To trace C stabilization in paddies, soil was sampled from a long-term field experiment under an unfertilized Control and NPK, NPK + straw, and NPK + manure fertilizer regimes. Soil was analyzed for total C, microbial biomass (MB), and dissolved organic C, and separated into three classes based on aggregate size (>250 mu m, 53-250 mu m, and <53 mu m) followed by density fractionation of each class to obtain free and occluded light fractions as well as dense and mineral heavy fractions. Pathways of C were determined based on C content and delta C-13 in all pools. The highest increase in total C (69%) was in NPK + manure, whereas the MBC increased with fertilization by at least 29% compared with the Control. All fertilizers increased macro-aggregation by at least 111% compared with the Control. The highest C content in the aggregates was in the mineral fractions of macroaggregates. Fertilization decreased the delta C-13 of total SOM compared with the Control, indicating suppressed decomposition of organic compounds. Aggregate size classes showed a typical delta C-13 enrichment trend from macro-to microaggregates, reflecting similarities between paddy and upland soils. A detailed scheme of C flows within aggregates and SOM fractions based on the delta C-13 natural abundance revealed the following general sequence: mineral -> dense -> free light -> occluded light fractions. This trend, which is partly opposite to that observed in upland soils, reflects the anoxic and variable redox conditions of paddies. This facilitates the predominant stabilization of recent C input in the mineral fraction with Fe oxides due to Fe2+/Fe3+ dynamics, whereas light fractions are processed by microorganisms mainly in periods without overflooding. The C pathways in the two heavy fractions were separate from those in the two light fractions, which also indicates differences in the C stabilization processes between paddy and upland soils. Thus, the present study provides further detailed insights into the C stabilizing mechanisms in paddy soils which depend on management.","2020",NA,"10.1016/j.soilbio.2020.107931","WOS:000567094800014"

The high-throughput sequencing dataset was analyzed by variation partitioning, null model, and neutral community model analyses. We demonstrated that microbial community assembly was governed more by species sorting than by dispersal limitation in maize fields, and to a lesser extent in rice fields. The relative importance of species sorting in maize soils was greater at low latitudes than at high latitudes, while rice soils exhibited an opposite trend. Microbial co-occurrence associations tended to be higher when communities were primarily driven by dispersal limitation relative to species sorting. There were greater community dissimilarities between maize and rice soils in low-latitude regions, which was consistent with the higher proportion of negative edges in the correlation networks. The results indicate that a balance between species sorting and dispersal limitation mediates species coexistence in soil microbiomes.

E. Hutchinson raised the paradox of how a number of phytoplankton species competing for the same resources are able to coexist in a relatively isotropic environment. As a key for solving the paradox, we focused on the limiting similarity which prohibits the coexistence of similar species. We expected that the limiting similarity will be mitigated by some factors which are not represented in traditional theoretical studies but can be represented if we use a three-dimensional (3D) model. The use of a 3D model enables us to explore the limiting similarity without using the controversial assumption connecting niche overlap with the competitive exclusion in previous theoretical studies. Furthermore, while constant or no dispersion is given in theoretical studies, it is explicitly represented in a 3D model. The coexistence of similar species in 3D environments was explored by dividing a target persistent species in a quasi-equilibrium community into 80 subspecies, which were slightly different from one another at the optimum temperature for population growth. In the experiments, we found cases in which several dozens of species having nearly-overlapping niches coexist stably at a point for over 80 years. The comparison of experiments with and without dispersion by oceanic currents revealed that dispersion negates the progress of competitive exclusion or significantly delays the exclusion. The result that species having nearly-overlapping niches are able to coexist also highlights the crucial role of the specific rate in determining the number of coexisting species. If the number of coexisting species is not determined by the limiting similarity, it will be determined by the frequency of speciation events, as in the neutral theory.","2020",NA,"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.109089","WOS:000540447700006"

Typically, weakly interacting species that occupy largely distinct niches result in stable mixed populations, while strong interactions and competition for the same niche result in rapid extinctions of some species and fixations of others. We investigate the transition of a deterministically stable mixed population to a stochasticity-induced fixation as a function of the niche overlap between the two species.

Here, we used phytoplankton, which are a classic model for evaluating interactions between species, grown with and without associated bacteria to test whether the bacteria alter the strength and type of species interactions within a trophic level. We demonstrate that host-associated bacteria alter host growth rates and carrying capacity. This did not change the type but frequently changed the strength of host interspecific interactions by facilitating host growth in the presence of an established species. These findings indicate that microbiomes can regulate their host species' interspecific interactions. As between-species interaction strength impacts their ability to coexist, our findings show that microbiomes have the potential to modulate eukaryotic species diversity and community composition. IMPORTANCE Description of the Earth's microbiota has recently undergone a phenomenal expansion that has challenged basic assumptions in many areas of biology, including hominid evolution, human gastrointestinal and neurodevelopmental disorders, and plant adaptation to climate change. By using the classic model system of freshwater phytoplankton that has been drawn upon for numerous foundational theories in ecology, we show that microbiomes, by facilitating their host population, can also influence between-species interactions among their eukaryotic hosts. Betweenspecies interactions, including competition for resources, has been a central tenet in the field of ecology because of its implications for the diversity and composition of communities and how this in turn shapes ecosystem functioning.","2020",NA,"10.1128/mBio.02657-19","WOS:000518763400051"

In situ diet analysis of co-occurring six copepod species in coral waters of the Sanya Bay was conducted using a PCR protocol based on 18S ribosomal gene. Various prey organisms were uncovered, including dinoflagellate, diatom, green algae and plant, protozoa and metazoan. All these spatially coexisting six species showed different dietary diversity, with the food niche breadth (B) ranging from 1.00 (Temora turbinate in morning) to 10.68 (Calanopia elliptica in night). While food overlap between all these copepods were low, with the average value of the diet niche overlap index being approximately 0.09. Even temporally co-existing species sampled from the same time point fed on different groups of prey items with the food overlap index of 0.04 to 0.07 in midday and night but 0 in morning. As the most important dominant copepod in the Sanya Bay, Subeucalanus subcrassus seems to be capable to regulate its feeding, by exhibiting a rhythm of herbivorous feeding in midday and carnivorous feeding in morning and night, to better coordinate with other competitors for utilization of food resources. For most copepods, none of the prey items belonged to the dominant phytoplankton in the ambient water, indicating that copepod can better their survival by widening the choice of potential food resources in food limited environment.

However, teasing these drivers apart from other influences is problematic in natural systems, while laboratory assessments often fail to replicate relevant natural conditions. One such potential bloom-forming species complex highlighted globally is Mesodinium cf. rubrum, a planktonic ciliate. This species occurs persistently in the Sundays Estuary in South Africa yet has never been observed to bloom ( 1,000 cell.ml-1). Modified by artificial nutrient-rich baseflow conditions, the Sundays Estuary provides a unique Southern Hemisphere case study to identify the autecological drivers of this ciliate due to artificial seasonally controlled abiotic environmental conditions. This study utilised a three-year monitoring dataset (899 samples) to assess the drivers of M. cf. rubrum using a generalised modelling approach. Key abiotic variables that influenced population abundance were season and salinity, with M. cf. rubrum populations peaking in summer and spring and preferring polyhaline salinity regions (>18) with pronounced water column salinity stratification, especially in warmer months. This was reflected in the diel vertical migration (DVM) behaviour of this species, demonstrating its ability to utilise the optimal daylight photosynthetic surface conditions and high-nutrient bottom waters at night. The only phytoplankton groups clearly associated with M. cf. rubrum were Raphidophyceae and Cryptophyceae. Although M. cf. rubrum reflects a niche overlap with the dominant HAB-forming phytoplankton in the estuary (the raphidophyte, Heterosigma akashiwo), its reduced competitive abilities restrict its abundance. In contrast, the mixotrophic foraging behaviour of M. cf. rubrum exerts a top-down control on cryptophyte prey abundance, yet, the limited availability of these prey resources (mean < 300 cells ml 1) seemingly inhibits the formation of red-water accumulations. Hydrodynamic variability is necessary to ensure that no single phytoplankton HAB-forming taxa outcompetes the rest. These results confirm aspects of the autecology of M. cf. rubrum related to salinity associations and DVM behaviour and contribute to a global understanding of managing HABs in estuaries.","2020",NA,"10.1016/j.hal.2020.101943","WOS:000599869000005"

We then review recent advances in related ecological theory. These theoretical studies have confirmed that specialist natural enemies can promote tree diversity. However, they have also shown that the impact of natural enemies may be weakened, or that natural enemies could even cause species exclusion, depending on enemy host range, the spatial extent of enemy effects, and variation among plant species in seed dispersal or enemy susceptibility.

However, it remains unclear whether or not it is possible to develop efficient restoration strategies that are based on field investigations? Here, we conducted a field-based investigation along a land degradation gradient on the Tibetan Plateau. Along this gradient, we compared species composition, Pianka's niche overlap, and total aboveground biomass among grasses, sedges, legumes, and forbs. We also used Faith's (1992) phylogenetic diversity index (PD) and the net relatedness index (NRI) to measure community phylogenetic patterns. To understand the effects of abiotic filtering, we measured soil pH, moisture, electrical conductivity, total soil organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon, and microbial biomass nitrogen. Our results show that grasses replaced sedges and mesoxerophytes replaced mesohydrophytes with increasing land degradation. We also found that niche overlap declined with increasing degradation intensity. Furthermore, grass biomass increased, while sedges and legumes decreased, and forb biomass showed a hump-shaped relationship with degradation intensity. In addition, the communities transitioned from a clustered to a more random phylogenetic pattern. Soil conditions changed from acidic to alkaline and from fertile to harsh (p < .05). High niche overlap indicates a high biotic filtering at lightly degraded land where abiotic filtering is less stressful. However, when degradation is intense, abiotic filtering is apparent, as indicated by low levels of niche overlap. Overall, we suggest that distantly related, arid tolerant and hardy plants, and soil reclamation should be considered in degraded alpine lands restoration.","2020","JUL 2020","10.1002/ldr.3613","WOS:000544420800001"

Heterotrophic sessile marine invertebrate communities are extremely diverse but traditionally, space was viewed as the sole limiting resource. Recently planktonic food was recognized as an additional limiting resource, but the degree to which planktonic food acts as a single resource or is utilized differentially remains unclear. In other words, whether planktonic food represents a single resource niche or multiple resource niches has not been established. We estimated the rate at which 11 species of marine invertebrates consumed three phytoplankton species, each different in shape and size. Rates of consumption varied by a 240-fold difference among the species considered and, while there was overlap in the consumer diets, we found evidence for differential resource usage (i.e. consumption rates of phytoplankton differed among consumers). No consumer ingested all phytoplankton species at equivalent rates, instead most species tended to consume one of the species much more than others. Our results suggest that utilization of the phytoplankton niche by filter feeders is more subdivided than previously thought, and resource specialization may facilitate coexistence in this system. Our results provide a putative mechanism for why diversity affects community function and invasion in a classic system for studying competition.","2020","OCT 2020","10.1007/s00442-020-04791-w","WOS:000580503800003"

These fish have a similar trophic role to the keystone polar cod (Boreogadus saida), potentially competing for food resources when co-occurring. To evaluate this, we calculated feeding niche breadth and overlap based on fatty acids and delta N-15- and delta C-13-derived trophic position and carbon source, among sub-Arctic fish and 10 Arctic fish and invertebrates within low, mid, and high latitudes of the Canadian Arctic. Diverse feeding strategies including benthicMyoxocephalussp., anadromous and pelagic fish, led to limited feeding niche overlap among species (13% average, range 0-96%). Feeding niche overlap between capelin and sand lance from the low Arctic was generally high (36-93%); while fatty acid niches of these fish overlapped 0-21% with polar cod in the mid and high Arctic, and their isotopic niches overlapped up to 96%. Capelin and sand lance showed 3-8 times broader feeding niches than polar cod. Regarding regional variation, polar cod had similar niche breadth between regions and highly overlapping fatty acid niches. Niche variation forMyoxocephalussp. andGammarusspp. between low and high Arctic was likely associated with more diverse sources of primary production in the shallower, more brackish low Arctic. Although regional variation in food availability play an important role defining feeding niches, broader niches and isotopic niche overlap with polar cod indicated a potential ecological advantage for capelin and sand lance over polar cod under climate change.","2020","OCT 2020","10.1007/s00300-020-02738-8","WOS:000574327500001"

Species' minimum resource requirements, their R*s, are key traits that link individual physiological demands to the outcome of competition. However, a major question remains unanswered-to what extent are species' competitive traits able to evolve in response to resource limitation? To address this knowledge gap, we performed an evolution experiment in which we exposed Chlamydomonas reinhardtii for approximately 285 generations to seven environments in chemostats that differed in resource supply ratios (including nitrogen, phosphorus and light limitation) and salt stress. We then grew the ancestors and descendants in a common garden and quantified their competitive abilities for essential resources. We investigated constraints on trait evolution by testing whether changes in resource requirements for different resources were correlated. Competitive abilities for phosphorus improved in all populations, while competitive abilities for nitrogen and light increased in some populations and decreased in others. In contrast to the common assumption that there are trade-offs between competitive abilities for different resources, we found that improvements in competitive ability for a resource came at no detectable cost. Instead, improvements in competitive ability for multiple resources were either positively correlated or not significantly correlated. Using resource competition theory, we then demonstrated that rapid adaptation in competitive traits altered the predicted outcomes of competition. These results highlight the need to incorporate contemporary evolutionary change into predictions of competitive community dynamics over environmental gradients.

These organisms exhibit different features that allow them to colonize either the epilimnion (Stentor araucanus) or the metalimnion (Ophrydium naumanni). S. araucanus is a dark pigmented (stentorin) species resistant to ultraviolet radiation and needs high light supply to maintain endosymbiotic algal photosynthesis. In contrast, O. naumanni dominates the phothosynthetic biomass in the deep chlorophyll maxima (metalimnion) of these lakes, being photosynthetically efficient at low light intensities but susceptible to photoinhibition at epilimnetic light irradiances. Analysis of food vacuoles revealed a weak niche overlap, however light climate, shaped by temporal or spatial variations in thermocline depth, resulted in a key factor modulating the relative success of these mixotrophic ciliate species. Overall, these species are stoichiometrically, carbon to nutrients, more balanced than the bulk seston, but the mechanisms by which each species regulates the elemental balance differ. O. naumanni increases bacterivory with light, thus increasing phosphorus uptake, while S. araucanus regulates carbon fixation. The low carbon:nutrient ratio of these organisms would represent a very good food source for zooplankton. Finally, we pointed out that different effects of local and global changes will affect negatively the particular ciliate assemblage of North-Patagonian Andean lakes.","2020",NA,"10.23818/limn.39.17","WOS:000509685900018"

Individually, pathogens and mutualists can each stabilize (via negative feedback) or destabilize (via positive feedback) host-host interactions. When pathogens and mutualists are both present, the potential for simultaneous positive and negative feedbacks can generate a wide range of possible effects on host species coexistence and turnover. Extending existing theoretical frameworks, we explore the range of dynamics generated by simultaneous interactions with pathogens and mutualists and identify the conditions for pathogen or mutualist mediation of host coexistence. We then explore the potential role of microbial mutualists and pathogens in plant species turnover during succession. We show how a combination of positive and negative plant-microbe feedbacks can generate a coexistence state that is part of a set of alternative stable states.

It is known that the specific composition and abundance of certain bacterial species affect host health and fitness, but the processes that lead to these microbial patterns are unknown. We investigate this by deconstructing the simple microbiome of the freshwater polyp Hydra. We contrast the performance of its two main bacterial associates, Curvibacter and Duganella, on germfree hosts with two in vitro environments over time. We show that interactions within the microbiome but also the host environment lead to the observed species frequencies and abundances. More specifically, we find that both microbial species can only stably coexist in the host environment, whereas Duganella outcompetes Curvibacter in both in vitro environments irrespective of initial starting frequencies. While Duganella seems to benefit through secretions of Curvibacter, its competitive effect on Curvibacter depends upon direct contact. The competition might potentially be mitigated through the spatial distribution of the two microbial species on the host, which would explain why both species stably coexist on the host. Interestingly, the relative abundances of both species on the host do not match the relative abundances reported previously nor the overall microbiome carrying capacity as reported in this study. Both observations indicate that rare microbial community members might be relevant for achieving the native community composition and carrying capacity. Our study highlights that for dissecting microbial interactions the specific environmental conditions need to be replicated, a goal difficult to achieve with in vitro systems. IMPORTANCE This work studies microbial interactions within the microbiome of the simple cnidarian Hydra and investigates whether microbial species coexistence and community stability depend on the host environment. We find that the outcome of the interaction between the two most dominant bacterial species in Hydra's microbiome differs depending on the environment and results in a stable coexistence only in the host context. The interactive ecology between the host and the two most dominant microbes, but also the less abundant members of the microbiome, is critically important for achieving the native community composition.

We found evidence for local adaptation between Fusarium and Streptomyces populations as indicated by significantly greater inhibition among sympatric than allopatric populations. Additionally, for both taxa, there was a significant positive correlation between the strength of inhibition against the other taxon and the intensity of resource competition from that taxon among sympatric but not allopatric populations.

However, whether the composition of GSL mat communities covaries with microbialite morphology and lake environment is unknown. Moreover, the potential adaptations that allow the establishment of these extensive mat communities at high salinity (14% to 17% total salts) are poorly understood. To address these questions, microbial mats were sampled from seven locations in the south arm of GSL representing different lake environments and microbialite morphologies. Despite the morphological differences, microbialite-associated mats were taxonomically similar and were dominated by the cyanobacterium Euhalothece and several heterotrophic bacteria. Metagenomic sequencing of a representative mat revealed Euhalothece and subdominant Thiohalocapsa populations that harbor the Calvin cycle and nitrogenase, suggesting they supply fixed carbon and nitrogen to heterotrophic bacteria. Fifteen of the next sixteen most abundant taxa are inferred to be aerobic heterotrophs and, surprisingly, harbor reaction center, rhodopsin, and/or bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis proteins, suggesting aerobic photoheterotrophic (APH) capabilities. Importantly, proteins involved in APH are enriched in the GSL community relative to that in microbialite mat communities from lower salinity environments. These findings indicate that the ability to integrate light into energy metabolism is a key adaptation allowing for robust mat development in the hypersaline GSL. IMPORTANCE The earliest evidence of life on Earth is from organosedimentary structures, termed microbialites, preserved in 3.481-billion-year-old (Ga) rocks. Phototrophic microbial mats form in association with an similar to 700-km(2) expanse of morphologically diverse microbialites in the hypersaline Great Salt Lake (GSL), Utah. Here, we show taxonomically similar microbial mat communities are associated with morphologically diverse microbialites across the lake. Metagenomic sequencing reveals an abundance and diversity of autotrophic and heterotrophic taxa capable of harvesting light energy to drive metabolism. The unexpected abundance of and diversity in the mechanisms of harvesting light energy observed in GSL mat populations likely function to minimize niche overlap among coinhabiting taxa, provide a mechanism(s) to increase energy yield and osmotic balance during salt stress, and enhance fitness. Together, these physiological benefits promote the formation of robust mats that, in turn, influence the formation of morphologically diverse microbialite structures that can be imprinted in the rock record.","2020",NA,"10.1128/AEM.00165-20","WOS:000534070600005"

However, across a range of edaphic conditions the interactive effects of these drivers on complex plant communities remain unclear. For example, plant-soil feedback studies focus on soil trained by a single plant species. We developed a method to assess effects of plant-microbial interactions (PMI) on a complex plant community. We established mesocosms with 13 grassland species, grown individually or together, in overgrazed or restored soil, with or without soil microbial inoculum collected from a productive and diverse native grassland. We assessed biomass production as influenced by edaphic conditions, interspecific competition and PMI. Furthermore, we assessed potential influences of interspecific competition and edaphic conditions on strength and direction of PMI. Our results indicate PMI drives negative growth responses for graminoids while forbs experience positive growth responses. Generally, interspecific competition did not alter the magnitude or direction of PMI-mediated growth responses. Edaphic conditions altered the influence of soil microbial communities on individual plant growth while PMI facilitated plant evenness. In plant community mesocosms, PMI-associated benefits were observed in overgrazed soil. However, interspecific competition overwhelmed plant growth benefits associated with soil microbial communities when plant communities were grown in restored soil. In mesocosms containing dominant grass species, interspecific competition had negative effects on species coexistence, but both positive and negative PMI partially counterbalanced this influence on plant species evenness.

Plant species are thought to perform worse on soil conditioned by the same species compared to soil of other species, which serves as a self-limitation mechanism and averts monodominance of strong competitors. Here, we test in a multispecies community setting, whether root colonization and resource utilization of soil patches with distinct soil legacies are consistent with this hypothesis. We grew eight grassland species together in an outdoor mesocosm set-up in unconditioned soil and created soil patches in these communities conditioned by one of four plant species, or a soil mixture of all four. During two subsequent growing seasons, we tested the effect of these conditioned soil patches on below-ground root colonization into the patches of each surrounding plant species using a novel sequencing-based approach. In addition, we tested the effect of soil conditioning on local root functioning by injecting tracers into the soil patches and measuring the recovery in above-ground biomass. Against expectations, plant species did not place less roots in own soil patches compared to foreign soil patches, nor did species take up less tracer from own compared to foreign soil patches. Using structural equation modelling, we found that tracer uptake of the plant species was to a varying degree explained by root densities in the various soil patches and by differing soil nutrient availability of the soil patches. We conclude that soil legacy effects are inextricably connected to soil nutrient availability, which needs to be taken into account in plant-soil feedback research to understand the processes that shape plant communities. Synthesis. We found that soil legacy effects in complex, multispecies semi-field conditions did not match expectations based on theory and experiments in controlled conditions. Among the many complicating factors that may modify or even overrule soil legacy effects in semi-field settings, we identified soil nutrient availability as a critical force that may, together with soil biota, shape plant species coexistence processes.","2020",NA,"10.1111/1365-2745.13449","WOS:000579161100007"

Numerous habitats have been hypothesized as refugia from succession with important landscape-scale consequences from export of propagules, but their commonness among ecological systems is unknown because tests to demonstrate their existence have not been formulated and applied. In this study on an intertidal model system, an early successional tubeworm was highly abundant in a hypothesized refuge habitat-type where late successional algae could not establish. In adjacent non-refuge habitat, a change in species dominance involving tubeworms shifting to algae occurred from early to late succession following experimentally induced disturbance. No such change occurred in refuges where early successional tubeworm populations steadily increased throughout succession. Tubeworm recruitment was reduced in the presence of late successional algae, likely from competition in the non-refuge. The presence of habitats providing refugia from succession may have important consequences, e.g. promoting low but consistent levels of local-scale coexistence of early and late successional taxa observed here even without disturbance. Experimental tests such as these to identify refugia from succession will be useful to apply to larger-scale land/seascapes if, as in this study, the scale of experimentation is optimized for the species and processes of interest.

Sedum alfredii is widely used for soil phytoremediation owing to its capacity to extract heavy metals, such as Pb. Although efficient Pb extraction is mediated by complex interactions between the roots and rhizospheric bacteria, the mechanism by which S. alfredii recruits microorganisms under Pb stress remains unclear. The Pb-accumulating ecotype (AE) and non accumulating ecotype (NAE) of S. alfredii recruited different rhizobacterial communities. Under Pb stress, AE rhizosphere-enriched bacteria assembled into stable-connected clusters with higher phylogenetic and functional diversity. These microbes, e.g., Flavobacterium, could release indoleacetic acid to promote plant growth and siderophores, thereby increasing Pb availability. The NAE rhizosphere-enriched functional bacteria desperately assembled into highly specialized functional clusters with extremely low phylogenetic diversity. These bacteria, e.g., Pseudomonas, could enhance phosphorus solubilization and Pb precipitation, thereby reducing Pb stress and plant Pb accumulation. High niche overlap level of the rhizo-enriched species raised challenges in soil resource utilization, whereas the NAE community assembly was markedly constrained by environmental selection effect than that of AE rhizobacterial community. These results indicate that different ecotypes of S. alfredii recruit distinct bacterial functional assemblies to drive specific plant-soil feedbacks for different survival in Pb-contaminated soils. To cope with heavy metal stress, NAE formed a highly functional and specialized but vulnerable community and efficiently blocked heavy metal absorption by plants. However, the AE community adopted a more stable and elegant strategy to promote plant growth and the accumulation of dry matter via multiple evolutionary strategies that ensured a high yield of heavy metal phytoextraction.

"Pacciani-Mori, L; Giometto, A; Suweis, S; Maritan, A","Dynamic metabolic adaptation can promote species coexistence in competitive microbial communities","PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY","Author summary Since a celebrated experiment by Monod in 1949, we know that microbes can adapt their metabolic strategies in response to their environment, thus uptaking different nutrients at different rates depending on their relative quality and availability. It is currently unclear whether this physiological plasticity of microbes contributes to maintaining the high degree of diversity found in natural microbial communities, even in the presence of very few resources. By introducing dynamic and optimal metabolic strategies in consumer-resource models, we show that we can correctly reproduce the experimental growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae on two different resources and we show that dynamic metabolic strategies allow the community to self-organize and to ensure the coexistence of multiple species competing for few resources. Microbes are capable of physiologically adapting to diverse environmental conditions by differentially varying the rates at which they uptake different nutrients. In particular, microbes can switch hierarchically between different energy sources, consuming first those that ensure the highest growth rate. Experimentally, this can result in biphasic growth curves called diauxic shifts that typically arise when microbes are grown in media containing several nutrients. Despite these observations are well known in microbiology and molecular biology, the mathematical models generally used to describe the population dynamics of microbial communities do not account for dynamic metabolic adaptation, thus implicitly assuming that microbes cannot switch dynamically from one resource to another. Here, we introduce dynamic metabolic adaptation in the framework of consumer-resource models, which are commonly used to describe competitive microbial communities, allowing each species to temporally change its preferred energy source to maximize its own relative fitness. We show that dynamic metabolic adaptation enables the community to self-organize, allowing several species to coexist even in the presence of few resources, and to respond optimally to a time-dependent environment, thus showing that dynamic metabolic adaptation could be an important mechanism for maintaining high levels of diversity even in environments with few energy sources. We show that introducing dynamic metabolic strategies in consumer-resource models is necessary for reproducing experimental growth curves of the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae growing in the presence of two carbon sources. Even though diauxic shifts emerge naturally from the model when two resources are qualitatively very different, the model predicts that the existence of such shifts is not a prerequisite for species coexistence in competitive communities.","2020",NA,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007896","WOS:000538053200033"

Here, we apply concepts from ecological theory to understand how biotic and abiotic factors affect interaction patterns between the two opportunistic human pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, which often cooccur in polymicrobial infections. Specifically, we conducted a series of short- and long-term competition experiments between P. aeruginosa PAO1 (as our reference strain) and three different S. aureus strains (Cowan I, 6850, and JE2) at three starting frequencies and under three environmental (culturing) conditions. We found that the competitive ability of P. aeruginosa strongly depended on the strain background of S. aureus, whereby P. aeruginosa dominated against Cowan I and 6850 but not against JE2. In the latter case, both species could end up as winners depending on conditions. Specifically, we observed strong frequency-dependent fitness patterns, including positive frequency dependence, where P. aeruginosa could dominate JE2 only when common (not when rare). Finally, changes in environmental (culturing) conditions fundamentally altered the competitive balance between the two species in a way that P. aeruginosa dominance increased when moving from shaken to static environments. Altogether, our results highlight that ecological details can have profound effects on the competitive dynamics between coinfecting pathogens and determine whether two species can coexist or invade each others' populations from a state of rare frequency. Moreover, our findings might parallel certain dynamics observed in chronic polymicrobial infections. IMPORTANCE Bacterial infections are frequently caused by more than one species, and such polymicrobial infections are often considered more virulent and more difficult to treat than the respective monospecies infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are among the most important pathogens in polymicrobial infections, and their cooccurrence is linked to worse disease outcome. There is great interest in understanding how these two species interact and what the consequences for the host are. While previous studies have mainly looked at molecular mechanisms implicated in interactions between P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, here we show that ecological factors, such as strain background, species frequency, and environmental conditions, are important elements determining population dynamics and species coexistence patterns. We propose that the uncovered principles also play major roles in infections and, therefore, proclaim that an integrative approach combining molecular and ecological aspects is required to fully understand polymicrobial infections.","2020",NA,"10.1128/AEM.00962-20","WOS:000566699700008"

Our efforts to engineer microbiomes-for example to improve human health-would benefit from mathematical models that accurately describe how microbes exchange metabolites with each other and how their environment shapes these exchanges. But what is an appropriate level of details for those models? We propose an intermediate level to model metabolic exchanges between microbes. We show that these models can accurately describe population dynamics in three laboratory communities and predicts their stability in response to perturbations such as changes in the nutrients available in the medium that they grow on. Our work suggests that a highly detailed metabolic network model is unnecessary for extracting ecological insights from experimental data and improves mathematical models so that one day we may be able to predict the behavior of real-world communities such as the human microbiome. Social interaction between microbes can be described at many levels of details: from the biochemistry of cell-cell interactions to the ecological dynamics of populations. Choosing an appropriate level to model microbial communities without losing generality remains a challenge. Here we show that modeling cross-feeding interactions at an intermediate level between genome-scale metabolic models of individual species and consumer-resource models of ecosystems is suitable to experimental data. We applied our modeling framework to three published examples of multi-strainEscherichia colicommunities with increasing complexity: uni-, bi-, and multi-directional cross-feeding of either substitutable metabolic byproducts or essential nutrients. The intermediate-scale model accurately fit empirical data and quantified metabolic exchange rates that are hard to measure experimentally, even for a complex community of 14 amino acid auxotrophies. By studying the conditions of species coexistence, the ecological outcomes of cross-feeding interactions, and each community's robustness to perturbations, we extracted new quantitative insights from these three published experimental datasets. Our analysis provides a foundation to quantify cross-feeding interactions from experimental data, and highlights the importance of metabolic exchanges in the dynamics and stability of microbial communities.","2020",NA,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008135","WOS:000563453300005"

We relate feedback theory, which focuses on pathogen-mediated coexistence, to mechanisms of dilution derived from epidemiological models, with the central goal of gaining insights into host-pathogen interactions in a community context. We first compare the origin, structure, and application of epidemiological and feedback models. We then explore the mechanisms of dilution, which are grounded in single-pathogen, single-host epidemiological models, from the perspective of feedback theory. We also draw on feedback theory to examine how coinfecting pathogens, and pathogens that vary along a host specialist-generalist continuum, apply to dilution theory. By identifying synergies among the feedback and epidemiological approaches, we reveal ways in which organisms occupying different trophic levels contribute to diversity-disease relationships. Additionally, using feedbacks to distinguish dilution in disease incidence from dilution in the net effect of disease on host fitness allows us to articulate conditions under which definitions of dilution may not align. After ascribing dilution mechanisms to macro- or microorganisms, we propose ways in which each contributes to diversity-disease and productivity-diversity relationships.

Our results showed a fungal-dependent shift in the community structure operated by a wave-like spread of fairy rings that decreased plant, fungal and bacterial diversity, indicating a detrimental effect of fairy rings on most species. The fairy rings induced successional processes in plants that enhanced the replacement of a community dominated by perennial plants with short-living and fast-growing plant species. In parallel, fungal and bacterial communities showed evident differences in species composition with several taxa associated within distinct sampling zone across the fairy rings. Notably, bacteria belonging to the Burkholderia genus and fungi of the genus Trichoderma increased in response to the advancing mycelium of A. arvensis.

In most vineyards, ground vegetation is controlled by tillage and/or the application of broadband herbicides with scarcely known effects on the soil fauna. We studied a total of 16 commercial vineyards in the Tarnave wine region, a typical viticultural region in Transylvania, Central Romania. As a model organism for surface-dwelling arthropods we examined the response of springtail (Collembola) species richness and activity density to vineyard tillage practices, fertilization, and herbicide application. A total of 24 species in 10 families were found in the studied vineyards. Principal coordinates analysis (PGA) identified three distinct springtail communities linked to tillage and fertilization practice. Springtail species richness was positively associated with high tillage intensity (frequency: once or twice a year). Springtail activity density in inter-rows was positively correlated with inter-row tillage and herbicide application under grapevines. For the first time we could show that springtail species assemblages in vineyards were characterized by high niche overlap regarding soil quality (organic matter, pH, CaCO3, P and K), indicating similar resource utilization. We conclude that the positive influence of vineyard management and disturbance on surface-dwelling springtail communities is possibly due to the exclusion of potential competitors and predators, the stimulation of microorganisms and/or an increased nutrient input.","2020",NA,"10.1016/j.agee.2020.107006","WOS:000540169600022"

This study used the ecological niche modeling (ENM) approach to anticipate the potential distribution of the etiological agent (Rickettsia rickettsii), vectors (Amblyomma sculptum and A. dubitatum), and hosts (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris, Didelphis aurita, and D. marsupialis) of BSF in Brazil. We compiled occurrence records for all vectors, hosts, and BSF from our own field surveillance, online repositories, and literature. ENM identified BSF risk areas in southeastern and southern Brazil, and anticipated other dispersed suitable areas in the western, central, and northeastern coast regions of Brazil. Tick vectors and mammalian hosts were confined to these same areas; however, host species showed broader suitability in northern Brazil. All species ENMs performed significantly better than random expectations. We also tested the BSF prediction based on 253 additional independent cases identified in our surveillance; the model anticipated 251 out of 253 of these independent cases. Background similarity tests comparing the ENMs of R. rickettsii, tick vectors, and mammalian hosts were unable to reject null hypotheses of niche similarity.

Fish were sampled at 14 sampling sites from Pelotas River and tributaries, Upper Uruguay, Brazil. The stomach contents of five species of Characidae (AstyanaxandBryconamericus) were analysed by the volumetric method. A geometric morphometric approach was used together with internal morphological traits to predict their patterns of prey use. Significant differences in body depth, snout and caudal peduncle lengths were found. Concomitant pronounced variations were verified to occur among species in structures related to digestion and absorption. Increased numbers of cusps, more pyloric caeca and higher intestinal coefficient values were observed in species that consumed greater proportions of plants. The opposite trends occurred in species that consumed greater proportions of insects. Mixed linear models indicated that the characin species differed significantly in the use of algae, aquatic insects, terrestrial insects, plant remains/seeds and detritus. Dietary differences reflected in low trophic niche overlap. Partial least squares regression results indicated strong correlations between morphological divergences and the corresponding variations in species diet. These outcomes combined confirm that the morphological traits that best enables the exploration of certain resource were an important factor in the resource-related divergence and were the underlying reasons for these species' respective feeding modes.","2020","MAR 2020","10.1111/eff.12540","WOS:000561634600001"

This study aimed to examine the body size, microhabitat and the feeding ecology of these freshwater crab species. Sex and carapace width and length of individuals were determined from specimens collected by hand at three waterfall sampling sites. Feeding and feeding niche overlap were respectively analyzed using the index of relative importance (IRI) of prey items from individual crab stomachs and the Schoener's R-o index. Food items ingested include fish fragments, insect body parts, fragments of aquatic vascular plants, freshwater algae, sand grains and amorphous materials, and these items were similar between species. However, the larger I. mindanaoense appeared to ingest more fish fragments and other animal prey items compared to S. miguelito which ingested more amorphous materials that are derived from benthic plants. However, the R-o value of 93% was high, suggesting very similar diet. The two species further partition niches, with S. miguelito being smaller in size and inhabiting sand and gravel substrate, while the larger I. mindanaoense inhabit areas with big boulders. Hence, the crabs can be categorized as omnivorous and detrivorous, and exhibit feeding and habitat niche partitioning that alleviate possible resource competition between the two species.","2020",NA,NA,"WOS:000572081300005"

Using a three-year manipulative community-scale experiment in a temperate forest, we show that plant-associated fungi, and to a lesser extent insect herbivores, reduce seedling recruitment and survival at high adult conspecific density. Plant-associated fungi are primarily responsible for reducing seedling recruitment near conspecific adults in ectomycorrhizal and shade-tolerant species.

"Jia, Y; Whalen, JK","A new perspective on functional redundancy and phylogenetic niche conservatism in soil microbial communities","PEDOSPHERE","Functional redundancy in soil microbial communities seems to contradict the notion that individual species have distinct metabolic niches in multi-species communities. All soil microbiota have the metabolic capacity for basic functions (e.g., respiration and nitrogen and phosphorus cycling), but only a few soil microbiota participate in rare functions (e.g., methanogenesis and mineralization of recalcitrant organic pollutants). The objective of this perspective paper is to use the phylogenetic niche conservatism theory as an explanation for the functional redundancy of soil microbiota. Phylogenetic niche conservatism is defined as the tendency for lineages to retain ancestral functional characteristics through evolutionary time-scales. The present-day soil microbiota is the result of a community assembly process that started when prokaryotes first appeared on Earth. For billions of years, microbiota have retained a highly conserved set of core genes that control the essential redox and biogeochemical reactions for life on Earth. These genes are passed from microbe to microbe, which contributes to functional redundancy in soil microbiota at the planetary scale. The assembly of microbial communities during soil formation is consistent with phylogenetic niche conservatism. Within a specific soil, the heterogeneous matrix provides an infinite number of sets of diverse environmental conditions, i.e., niches that lead to the divergence of microbial species. The phylogenetic niche conservatism theory predicts that two or more microbial species diverging from the same Glade will have an overlap in their niches, implying that they are functionally redundant in some of their metabolic processes. The endogenous genetic factors that constrain the adaptation of individuals and, thus, populations to changing environmental conditions constitute the core process of phylogenetic niche conservatism. Furthermore, the degree of functional redundancy in a particular soil is proportional to the complexity of the considered function. We conclude with a conceptual model that identifies six patterns of functional redundancy in soil microbial communities, consistent with the phylogenetic niche conservatism theory.","2020",NA,"10.1016/S1002-0160(19)60826-X","WOS:000502751600003"

Core enriched operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the W/B rhizosphere compared with the other three treatments (B, W, and B/W) were mainly affiliated with Alphaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, which are likely related to methanol oxidation, methylotrophy, fermentation, and ureolysis. Co-occurrence network analysis proved that grafting increased network complexity, including the number of nodes, edges, and modules. Moreover, grafting strengthened the structural robustness of the network in the rhizosphere, while ungrafted watermelon had the lowest network robustness. Homogeneous selection played a predominant role in bacterial community assembly, and the contribution of dispersal limitation was increased in grafted watermelon with bottle gourd rootstock.

A significant body of work suggests that fluctuations increase diversity due to a variety of proposed mechanisms. In this study, we compare the effects of constant and fluctuating dilution regimes on simple microbial communities with two or three species. We find that in all cases, the outcome in a fluctuating environment is the same as that in a constant environment in which the fluctuations are time-averaged. This surprising result highlights that in some communities, ecological stable states may be predicted by averaging environmental parameters, rather than by the variation itself. The effect of environmental fluctuations is a major question in ecology. While it is widely accepted that fluctuations and other types of disturbances can increase biodiversity, there are fewer examples of other types of outcomes in a fluctuating environment. Here we explore this question with laboratory microcosms, using cocultures of two bacterial species, P. putida and P. veronii. At low dilution rates we observe competitive exclusion of P. veronii, whereas at high dilution rates we observe competitive exclusion of P. putida. When the dilution rate alternates between high and low, we do not observe coexistence between the species, but rather alternative stable states, in which only one species survives and initial species' fractions determine the identity of the surviving species. The Lotka-Volterra model with a fluctuating mortality rate predicts that this outcome is independent of the timing of the fluctuations, and that the time-averaged mortality would also lead to alternative stable states, a prediction that we confirm experimentally. Other pairs of species can coexist in a fluctuating environment, and again consistent with the model we observe coexistence in the time-averaged dilution rate. We find a similar time-averaging result holds in a three-species community, highlighting that simple linear models can in some cases provide powerful insight into how communities will respond to environmental fluctuations.","2020",NA,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007934","WOS:000538053200025"

Focusing mainly on the zero-sum rock-paper-scissors game, equivalent to the cyclic Lotka-Volterra model, we study how the coupling of demographic and environmental noise influences the fixation properties. More specifically, we investigate which species is the most likely to prevail in a population of fluctuating size and how the outcome depends on the environmental variability. We show that demographic noise coupled with environmental randomness levels the field of cyclic competition by balancing the effect of selection. In particular, we show that fast switching effectively reduces the selection intensity proportionally to the variance of the carrying capacity. We determine the conditions under which new fixation scenarios arise, where the most likely species to prevail changes with the rate of switching and the variance of the carrying capacity. Random switching has a limited effect on the mean fixation time that scales linearly with the average population size. Hence, environmental randomness makes the cyclic competition more egalitarian, but does not prolong the species coexistence.

They are multi-host pathogens and cross-species infection is facilitated by the fact that viral entry is mediated by cellular Fc receptors recognizing antibody-coated viruses. We developed a pan-amdoparvovirus PCR and screened tissue samples from 666 wild carnivores (families Felidae, Canidae, and Mustelidae) from Newfoundland or Labrador (Canada) and molecularly characterized the identified strains. Fifty-four out of 666 (8.1%) animals were amdoparvovirus-positive. Infection rate was the highest in American mink (34/47, 72.3%), followed by foxes (Arctic and red foxes, 13/311, 4.2%), lynx (2/58, 3.5%), and American martens (5/156, 3.4%). No virus was detected in samples from 87 coyotes and 17 ermines. Viruses from Newfoundland were classified as Aleutian mink disease virus (AMDV). Mink harvested near AMDV-affected fur farms had higher prevalence (24/24, 100%) than other mink (10/23, 43.5%; P<0.001) and their viruses were phylogenetically closely related to those from farms, while most viruses from other mink were in other clades. Strains from three foxes and two lynx were highly related to mink strains. This proves that farms disperse AMDV that subsequently spreads among wild mink (maintenance host) and transmits to other spillover carnivore hosts. In Labrador two novel viruses were identified, Labrador amdoparvovirus 1 (LaAV-1) found in foxes (9/261, 3.5%) and martens (5/156, 3.4%), and LaAV-2 found in one fox (0.4%). LaAV-1 fulfills all requirements to be classified as a novel species. LaAV-1 was most similar to viruses of mink and skunks (AMDV and skunk amdoparvovirus (SKAV)) while LaAV-2 was more closely related to other viruses infecting canids. LaAV-1 capsid proteins were almost indistinguishable from those of AMDV in some regions, suggesting that LaAV-1 could be a virus of mustelids that can infect foxes. While intensive farming practices provide occasions for inter-species transmission in farms, niche overlap or predation could explain cross-species transmission in the wild, but competition among sympatric species reduces the chances of direct contacts, making this an infrequent event. Pan-amdoparvovirus detection methods in wide epidemiological investigations can play a crucial role in defining amdoparvoviral ecology and evolution and discovering novel viruses.","2020",NA,"10.1093/ve/veaa072","WOS:000610104700031"
"Martignoni, MM; Hart, MM; Garnier, J; Tyson, RC","Parasitism within mutualist guilds explains the maintenance of diversity in multi-species mutualisms","THEORETICAL ECOLOGY","We consider here mutualisms where there are multiple species sharing a resource supplied by the same partner. If, as commonly assumed, there is competition between the species, then only the superior competitor should persist. Nevertheless, coexistence of multiple species sharing the same mutualistic partner is a widespread phenomenon. Regulation of nutrient exchange, where each species receives resources from the partner in proportion to the strength of the mutualism between the two, has been proposed as the main mechanism for coexistence in multi-species mutualisms involving the transfer of nutrients. Significant arguments, however, challenge the importance of partner selection processes. We present a mathematical model, applied to the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis, to propose an alternative explanation for this coexistence. We show that asymmetric resource exchange between the plant and its fungal guild can lead to indirect parasitic interactions between guild members. In our model, the amount of carbon supplied by the plant to the fungi depends on both plant and fungal biomass, while the amount of phosphorus supplied by the fungi to the plant depends on both plant and fungal biomass when the plant is small, and effectively on fungal biomass only when the plant is large. As a consequence of these functional responses, more beneficial mutualists increase resource availability, and are indirectly exploited by less beneficial species that consume the resource and grow larger than they would in the absence of the better mutualists. As guild mutualists are not competing, competitive exclusion does not occur. Hence, the interaction structure can explain the maintenance of diversity within guilds in the absence of spatial structure and niche-related processes.","2020","JUL 2020","10.1007/s12080-020-00472-9","WOS:000553705600001"

However, turnover in plant species composition across space also contributes to biodiversity at larger spatial scales (beta-diversity). Despite mounting evidence that enemies can maintain alpha-diversity, we know little about their contributions to beta-diversity. Additionally, in the light of widespread habitat fragmentation and potentially modified insect and pathogen communities in forest fragments, the effects of fragment area on their diversity-maintaining roles are largely unknown. We carried out a field experiment to investigate how natural enemies in impact tree alpha and beta-diversity in a fragmented rainforest landscape in the Western Ghats, India. In 21 rainforest fragments, we suppressed insects and fungi/oomycetes with pesticides, and examined changes in the diversity of tree seedlings. We found that fungicide had no effect on alpha-diversity, but significantly decreased beta-diversity (species turnover among plots). The facilitative effects of fungi and oomycetes on beta-diversity, however, weakened as fragments decreased in area, indicating that certain specialized plant-pathogen interactions may be lost when fragments become smaller. Insecticide, in contrast, increased alpha-diversity but tended to decrease beta-diversity between distant plots. In summary, we found that interactions between plants and their natural enemies help maintain beta-diversity in large forest fragments but not in small fragments. Small fragments are often viewed as future reservoirs of biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes, but our findings suggest that modified interactions with natural enemies may result in the erosion of this diversity over time.","2020",NA,"10.3389/ffgc.2019.00088","WOS:000509547700001"
"Ke, PJ; Wan, J","Effects of soil microbes on plant competition: a perspective from modern coexistence theory","ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS","Growing evidence shows that soil microbes affect plant coexistence in a variety of systems. However, since these systems vary in the impacts microbes have on plants and in the ways plants compete with each other, it is challenging to integrate results into a general predictive theory. To this end, we suggest that the concepts of niche and fitness difference from modern coexistence theory should be used to contextualize how soil microbes contribute to plant coexistence. Synthesizing a range of mechanisms under a general plant-soil microbe interaction model, we show that, depending on host specificity, both pathogens and mutualists can affect the niche difference between competing plants. However, we emphasize the need to also consider the effect of soil microbes on plant fitness differences, a role often overlooked when examining their role in plant coexistence. Additionally, since our framework predicts that soil microbes modify the importance of plant-plant competition relative to other factors for determining the outcome of competition, we suggest that experimental work should simultaneously quantify microbial effects and plant competition. Thus, we propose experimental designs that efficiently measure both processes and show how our framework can be applied to identify the underlying drivers of coexistence. Using an empirical case study, we demonstrate that the processes driving coexistence can be counterintuitive, and that our general predictive framework provides a better way to identify the true processes through which soil microbes affect coexistence.","2020","OCT 2019","10.1002/ecm.1391","WOS:000491209700001"

In theory, coexistence is supposed to be maintained by the effects of equalizing mechanisms that reduce fitness differences among species, and stabilizing mechanisms that are the result of niche differences. The presence of stabilizing niche differences is hallmarked by negative frequency-dependent per capita rates of increase. However, rigorous experimental testing of how insect herbivores and fungal pathogens contribute to negative frequency dependence among co-occurring plant species, in particular in the context of biological invasions, is scarce. We present an experimental study in a grassland in central Germany, in which we established native and exotic-dominated communities on 1 m(2)-plots, and reduced above-and belowground fungal pathogens and insect herbivores by applying pesticides. We manipulated the frequencies of six native and six exotic focal species, in order to assemble one dominant and five rare species per community. We quantified productivity and diversity for each community, and recorded data on per capita rates of increase and other fitness components for two native and two exotic focal species over three years. We found that native and exotic-dominated communities did not differ in their productivity and diversity. Reduction of fungi and insects increased productivity but the effect was similar for both species origins, suggesting that effects of enemy release are transitory or not existent. Negative frequency-dependence was common in our species, but could not be linked to interactions with antagonists. Although focal species responded to the reduction of antagonists, these effects were only present at low frequency, suggesting a greater importance of intraspecific competition, e.g. for resources, in explaining the observed stabilizing niche differences. Offsetting responses of the two exotic focal species to both antagonist groups highlight the significance of equalizing mechanisms among native and exotic species at the community level. Our study demonstrates the importance of both equalizing and stabilizing mechanisms in the context of biological invasions and differential contributions of antagonistic interactions to these mechanisms.","2020",NA,"10.1016/j.ppees.2020.125565","WOS:000581856500005"

The trait data indicated a concave defense-growth trade-off, promoting fast-growing species with intermediate defense. With seasonally increasing grazing pressure, the community shifted toward higher defense levels at the cost of lower growth rates along the trade-off curve, while phosphate affinity explained some deviations from it.

In this study, we found that R. raciborskii occurred in 149 sites in 42 lakes in eastern and central China and coexisted with M. aeruginosa at most sites. Based on field results, a combination of invasion and competition experiments using a biomass gradient to evaluate the invasiveness and competitiveness of R. raciborskii compared with M. aeruginosa was conducted. In invasive groups, both R. raciborskii and M. aeruginosa were shown to have positive specific growth rates, indicating that R. raciborskii could coexist with M. aeruginosa. Furthermore, R. raciborskii was shown to grow faster from invasion while M. aeruginosa reduced growth for invasion. In competitive groups, R. raciborskii reached a higher maximum biomass and grew longer than M. aeruginosa. The specific growth rate of R. raciborskii was not inhibited by M. aeruginosa biomass, whereas the growth of M. aeruginosa was inhibited by R. raciborskii biomass. It was shown during the whole experiment that R. raciborskii tended to replace M. aeruginosa to become dominant owing to its faster growth rate and the eventual decline in growth of M. aeruginosa. With an increase in biomass of M. aeruginosa, the vegetative cell size and filament length of R. raciborskii gradually increased. This study has demonstrated that the inherent invasive traits of R. raciborskii, size differences, niche differences, and relative fitness differences between R. raciborskii and M. aeruginosa are crucial reasons for the invasive success of R. raciborskii.

The Dictyostelia are the largest and most complex group of such organisms. They can be subdivided into 4 major groups, with many species in groups 1-3 having additionally retained encystment. To understand fitness differences between spores and cysts, we measured long-term survival of spores and cysts under climate-mimicking conditions, investigated spore and cyst ultrastructure, and related fitness characteristics to species ecology. We found that spores and cysts survived 22 degrees C equally well, but that spores survived wet and dry frost better than cysts, with group 4 spores being most resilient. Spore walls consist of three layers and those of cysts of maximally two, while spores were also more compacted than cysts, with group 4 spores being the most compacted. Group 4 species were frequently isolated from arctic and alpine zones, which was rarely the case for group 1-3 species.

While the consequences of global warming are being studied for an increasing number of species, limited attention has been given to the evolutionary dynamics of endosymbionts in response to climate change. Here, we address this question by studying the dynamics of Wolbachia, a well-studied endosymbiont of Drosophila melanogaster. D. melanogaster populations infected with 13 different Wolbachia strains were exposed to novel hot and cold laboratory environments for up to 180 generations. The short-term dynamics suggested a temperature-related fitness difference resulting in the increase of clade V strains in the cold environment only. Our long-term analysis now uncovers that clade V dominates in all replicates after generation 60 irrespective of temperature treatment. We propose that adaptation of the Drosophila host to either temperature or Drosophila C virus (DCV) infection are the cause of the replicated, temporally non-concordant Wolbachia dynamics.

Nitrogen (N) is a major nutrient limiting plant growth in most terrestrial ecosystems. Both niche partitioning and fitness equalizing mechanisms related to N acquisition have been proposed to explain the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. However, their relative importance remains controversial and unclear, especially in worldwide terrestrial ecosystems increasingly threatened by N deposition. 2. We added NH4NO3 at four levels over 7 years in an alpine meadow on Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau to simulate the effects of N deposition. Nine species that all occurred along an N addition gradient were selected for in-situ N-15 labeling experiment to quantify their uptake of ammonium verse nitrate. 3. Plants absorbed more ammonium and nitrate with increased N addition. We found limited inorganic N niche partitioning along the N addition gradient. Instead, species tended to prefer the most abundant form of inorganic N in soil, i.e. ammonium. Of all possible linear mixed effects models constructed to explain variation in either ammonium or nitrate uptake, the most parsimonious one included soil available N. That means plant' N uptake is influenced by habitat qualities, instead of the amount of added N itself. 4. Our findings suggest that inorganic N niche partitioning may play limited role in the maintenance of high diversity in this alpine meadow. Instead, species coexistence might be promoted by minimizing their fitness differences through preferring the most abundant form of inorganic N in the soil. This provides important insights into species coexistence under future N addition in Tibetan alpine meadows. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Experimental evolution of microbes can be used to empirically address a wide range of questions about evolution and is increasingly employed to study complex phenomena ranging from genetic evolution to evolutionary rescue. Regardless of experimental aims, fitness assays are a central component of this type of research, and low-throughput often limits the scope and complexity of experimental evolution studies. We created an experimental evolution system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that utilizes genetic barcoding to overcome this challenge. Results. We first confirm that barcode insertions do not alter fitness and that barcode sequencing can be used to efficiently detect fitness differences via pooled competition-based fitness assays. Next, we examine the effects of ploidy, chemical stress, and population bottleneck size on the evolutionary dynamics and fitness gains (adaptation) in a total of 76 experimentally evolving, asexual populations by conducting 1,216 fitness assays and analyzing 532 longitudinal-evolutionary samples collected from the evolving populations. In our analysis of these data we describe the strengths of this experimental evolution system and explore sources of error in our measurements of fitness and evolutionary dynamics. Conclusions. Our experimental treatments generated distinct fitness effects and evolutionary dynamics, respectively quantified via multiplexed fitness assays and barcode lineage tracking.

"Bachelot, B; Lee, CT","Disturbances Can Promote and Hinder Coexistence of Competitors in Ongoing Partner Choice Mutualisms","AMERICAN NATURALIST","Ecosystems are under threat from anthropogenic and natural disturbances, yet little is known about how these disturbances alter mutualistic interactions. Many mutualistic interactions are highly context dependent and dynamic due to ongoing partner choice, impeding our understanding of how disturbances might influence mutualistic systems. Previously we showed that in the absence of additional known mechanisms of competitive coexistence, mutualistic fungi can coexist in a system where the plant community associates dynamically with two empirically defined arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal types: a cheap kind that provides low nutrient benefits, and an expensive type that provides high nutrient benefits. We built on this framework to ask how disturbances of different types, frequencies, amplitudes, and predictabilities alter ongoing partner choice and thereby influence the coexistence of mutualists. We found that the effects of disturbances depend on the type, amplitude, and predictability of disturbances and, to a lesser extent, on their frequency. Disturbance can disrupt mutualist coexistence by enabling hosts more efficiently to exclude partners that behave as parasites. Disturbance can also promote coexistence by altering the strength and direction of consumer-resource interactions. Predicting the effects of disturbance on the mutualist community therefore requires us to understand better the consumer-resource relationships under various environmental conditions. We show how, through such context-dependent effects, disturbance and ongoing partner choice can together generate relative nonlinearity and investment in future benefit, introducing fluctuation-dependent mechanisms of competitive coexistence. Our findings support a broadening of the conceptual framework regarding disturbances and competition to indude fluctuation-dependent mechanisms alongside the spatiotemporal intermediate disturbance hypothesis.","2020",NA,"10.1086/707258","WOS:000519584000006"

In the cowpea aphid (Aphis craccivora), it has been established that the facultative endosymbiontArsenophonusimproves aphid performance on black locust trees (Robinia pseudoacacia) but not on fava (Vicia faba). Here, we tested whether this fitness differential translated into contemporaneous evolution of aphid populations associated with the different plants.

By the end of the experiment,Arsenophonusinfection was >3x more common on black locust than fava, which is comparable to previously described infection frequencies in natural field populations. Our results clearly demonstrate that aphid populations with mixed facultative symbiont infection status can rapidly evolve in response to the selective environments imposed by different host plants. This selection differential may be a sufficient explanation for the global association betweenArsenophonus-infected cowpea aphids and black locust trees, without invoking additional assortative mechanisms. Because the aphid and plant originate from different parts of the world, we further hypothesize thatArsenophonusinfection may have acted as a preadaptation that has promoted functional specialization of infected aphids on a novel host plant.","2020","SEP 2020","10.1111/jeb.13697","WOS:000573580200001"

This is particularly important when comparing drug-resistant with drug-sensitive pathogen strains, when anticipating epidemiological implications of microbial diversity, and when designing control measures. Classical approaches quantify differences between microbial strains using the exponential growth model, and typically report a selection coefficient for the relative fitness differential between two strains. The apparent simplicity of such approaches comes with the costs of limiting the range of biological scenarios that can be captured, and biases strain fitness estimates to polarized extremes of competitive exclusion. Here, we propose a mathematical and statistical framework based on the Lotka-Volterra model, that can capture frequency-dependent competition between microbial strains within-host and upon transmission. As aproof-of-concept, the model is applied to a previously-published dataset fromin-vivocompetitive mixture experiments with influenza strains in ferrets (McCaw et al.,2011). We show that for the same data, our model predicts a scenario of coexistence between strains, and supports a higher bottleneck size in the range of 35-145 virions transmitted from donor to recipient host. Thanks to its simplicity and generality, such framework could be applied to other ecological scenarios of microbial competition, enabling a more complex and nuanced view of possible outcomes between two strains, beyond competitive exclusion.","2020",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2020.572487","WOS:000575148000001"

During the last decade, the period of Polar Night has been studied intensively in the Arctic. A continuous presence of an active microbial food web suggests the prevalence of low-level alternative copepod prey (such as microzooplankton) throughout this period of darkness. Here we provide further evidence of mid-winter zooplankton activity using a decadal record of moored acoustics from Kongsfjorden, Svalbard. We apply an individual based life-history model to investigate the fitness consequences of a range of over-wintering strategies (in terms of diapause timing and duration) under a variety of prey availability scenarios. In scenarios of no winter prey availability (P-win = 0 mu g C L-1), the optimal time to exit diapause is in March. However, as P-win increases (up to 40 mu g C L-1), there is little fitness difference in copepods exiting diapause in January compared to March. From this, we suggest that Calanus are able (in energetic terms) to either i) exit diapause early to deal with uncertainty in spring bloom timing, or ii) remain active throughout winter if diapause is not possible (i.e., environment not deep enough, or not enough lipid reserves built up over the previous summer). The range of viable overwintering strategies increases with increasing P-win, suggesting that there is more flexibility for Calanus spp. in a scenario of non-zero P-win.","2020",NA,"10.3389/fmars.2020.541564","WOS:000575584800001"

The ammonium concentration was the most important driver of Glade A comammox Nitrospira abundance, based on random forest regression analysis.

We also discuss potential pivotal environmental factors and metabolic flexibility that influence the community compositions of anammox bacteria. Particularly biodiversity of the genus Scalindua might have been largely underestimated. Several anammox bacteria have been successfully enriched from various source of biomass. We reevaluate their enrichment methods and culture medium compositions to gain a clue of niche differentiation of anammox bacteria. Furthermore, we formulate the current issues that must be addressed. Overall this review re-emphasizes the importance of enrichment cultures (preferably pure cultures), physiological characterization and direct microbial competition studies using enrichment cultures in laboratories.

However, there is still a lack of understanding concerning the effect of temperature on the zooplankton microbiome. Furthermore, it is unclear to what extent the zooplankton microbiome differs from free-living and particle-associated (PA) microbes. Here, we explicitly addressed these issues by investigating (1) the differences in free-living, PA, and zooplankton associated microbes and (2) the impact of temperature on these microbes in the water column of a series of lakes artificially warmed by two power plants. High-throughput amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene showed that diversity and composition of the bacterial community associated to zooplankton, PA, and bacterioplankton varied significantly from one another, grouping in different clusters indicating niche differentiation of pelagic microbes. From the abiotic parameters measured, temperature significantly affected the diversity and composition of all analyzed microbiomes. Two phyla (e.g., Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes) dominated in zooplankton microbiomes whereas Actinobacteria was the dominant phylum in the bacterioplankton. The microbial species richness and diversity was lower in zooplankton compared to bacterioplankton and PA. Surprisingly, genera of methane-oxidizing bacteria, methylotrophs and nitrifiers (e.g., Nitrobacter) significantly associated with the microbiome of zooplankton and PA.

In this study, DNA-based stable isotope probing showed significant niche differentiation in active aerobic methanotrophs in response to niche differentiation in upstream and downstream mangrove soils of the Tamsui estuary in northwestern Taiwan, in which salinity levels differ between winter and summer.MethylobacterandMethylomicrobium-like Type I methanotrophs dominated methane-oxidizing communities in the field conditions and were significantly(13)C-labeled in both upstream and downstream sites, whileMethylobacterwere well adapted to high salinity and low temperature.

To better understand ecological differences between AOA and AOB, we investigated the nitrification kinetics of AOA and AOB under eight replicated cropped and unmanaged ecosystems (including two fertilized natural systems) along a long-term management intensity gradient in the upper U.S. Midwest. For five of eight ecosystems, AOB but not AOA exhibited Haldane kinetics (inhibited by high NH4+ additions), especially in perennial and successional systems. In contrast, AOA predominantly exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics, suggesting greater resistance to high nitrogen inputs than AOB. These responses suggest the potential for NH4+-induced niche differentiation between AOA and AOB. Additionally, long-term fertilization significantly enhanced maximum nitrification rates (V-max) in the early successional systems for both AOA and AOB, but not in the deciduous forest systems. This was likely due to pH suppression of nitrification in the acidic forest soils, corroborated by a positive correlation of V-max with soil pH but not with amoA gene abundance. Results also demonstrated that soil nitrification potentials were relatively stable, as there were no seasonal differences. Overall, results suggest that (1) NH4+ inhibition of AOB but not AOA could be another factor contributing to niche differentiation between AOA and AOB in soil, and (2) nitrification by both AOA and AOB can be significantly promoted by long-term nitrogen inputs.","2020",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2020.568588","WOS:000592193500001"

The stable inheritance of plasmids depends on their segregation during cell division and their long-term persistence in a host population is thought to largely depend on their impact on the host fitness. Nonetheless, many plasmids found in nature are lacking a clear trait that is advantageous to their host; the determinants of plasmid evolutionary success in the absence of plasmid benefit to the host remain understudied. Here we show that stable plasmid inheritance is an important determinant of plasmid evolutionary success. Borrowing terminology from evolutionary biology of cellular living forms, we hypothesize that Darwinian fitness is key for the plasmid evolutionary success. Performing intracellular plasmid competitions between non-mobile plasmids enables us to compare the evolutionary success of plasmid genotypes within the host, i.e., the plasmid fitness. Intracellular head-to-head competitions between stable and unstable variants of the same model plasmid revealed that the stable plasmid variant has a higher fitness in comparison to the unstable plasmid. Preemptive plasmid competitions reveal that plasmid fitness may depend on the order of plasmid arrival in the host. Competitions between plasmids characterized by similar stability of inheritance reveal plasmid fitness differences depending on the plasmid-encoded trait. Our results further reveal that competing plasmids can be maintained in coexistence following plasmid fusions that maintain unstable plasmid variants over time. Plasmids are not only useful accessory genetic elements to their host but they are also evolving and replicating entities, similarly to cellular living forms. There is a clear link between plasmid genetics and plasmid evolutionary success - hence plasmids are evolving entities whose fitness is quantifiable.","2020",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2020.02062","WOS:000572245900001"

We present the first few network analyses of the hot-spring microbiome with 165 hot-spring microbiome samples taken globally by Sharp et al (2014) (with the temperature and pH ranged 7.5 degrees C-99 degrees C and 1.8-9.0, respectively), offering an ideal dataset for investigating the structure and functional interactions in the hot-spring microbiome via network analysis. Here we aim to identify the ecologically adaptive differences between Archaea and Bacteria and discover: (i) Competitions as represented by negative correlations seem to be extremely rare among Archaea species; in contrast, the competitions among Bacteria species are much more common. (ii) Archaea and Bacteria can form their own guilds and occupy their own niches, and pH seems to play an important role in niche differentiations. (iii) The abundances of most Bacteria and Archaea are not correlated to the temperature. Bacteria have slightly more species that are thermo-phobic and no Archaea are thermophobic. The temperature may have far more significant influences on species compositions than on species abundance. In other words, most 'resident' species can prosper in a wide range of temperatures but some 'nonresidents' may encounter difficulties to survive. Theoretically, this is consistent with the classic biogeography dogma of microbes-they may reach everywhere, but environment selects who can stay.","2020",NA,"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.109147","WOS:000557222300013"

We explored this possibility by comparing the gut microbiota of Madagascar's folivorous lemurs from Indriidae and Lepilemuridae. Occurring sympatrically in the eastern rainforest, our four, target species have different dietary specializations, including frugo-folivory (sifakas), young-leaf folivory (indri and woolly lemurs), and mature-leaf folivory (sportive lemurs). We collected fecal samples, from 2013 to 2017, and used amplicon sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively, to integrate analyses of gut microbiome structure and function with analysis of the colonic metabolome. The lemurs harbored species-specific microbiomes, metagenomes, and metabolomes that were tuned to their dietary specializations: Frugo-folivores had greater microbial and metagenomic diversity, and harbored generalist taxa. Mature-leaf folivores had greater individual microbiome variation, and taxa and metabolites putatively involved in cellulolysis. The consortia even differed between related, young-leaf specialists, with indri prioritizing metabolism of fiber and plant secondary compounds, and woolly lemurs prioritizing amino-acid cycling. Specialized gut microbiota and associated gastrointestinal morphologies enable folivores to variably tolerate resource fluctuation and support nutrient extraction from challenging resources (e.g., by metabolizing plant secondary compounds or recalcitrant fibers), perhaps ultimately facilitating host species' diversity and specialized feeding ecologies.","2020","APR 2020","10.1038/s41396-020-0640-4","WOS:000522804100001"
"Picoche, C; Barraquand, F","Strong self-regulation and widespread facilitative interactions in phytoplankton communities","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY","The persistence of phytoplanktonic diversity in spite of competition for basic resources has long been a source of wonder and inspiration to ecologists. To sort out, among the many coexistence mechanisms suggested by theory and experiments, which ones actually maintain diversity in natural ecosystems, long-term field studies are paramount. We analysed a large dataset of phytoplankton abundance time series using dynamic, multivariate autoregressive (MAR) models. Phytoplankton was counted and identified down to the genus level, every 2 weeks over 20 years, at 10 sites along the French coastline. MAR models allowed to estimate biotic interaction networks while also accounting for abiotic variables that may drive part of the phytoplankton fluctuations. We then analysed the ratio of intra to intertaxa interactions (a measure of niche differentiation), the frequency of negative versus positive interactions, and how stability metrics (both at the network and genus level) relate to network complexity and genus self-regulation or abundance. We showed that a strong self-regulation, with competition strength within a taxon (genus) an order of magnitude higher than between taxa, was present in all phytoplanktonic interaction networks. This much stronger intragenus competition suggests that niche differentiation-rather than neutrality-is commonplace in phytoplankton. Furthermore, interaction networks were dominated by positive net effects between phytoplanktonic taxa (on average, more than 50% of interactions were positive). While network stability (sensu resilience) was unrelated to complexity measures, we unveiled links between self-regulation, intergenera interaction strengths and abundance. The less common taxa tend to be more strongly self-regulated and can therefore maintain in spite of competition with more abundant ones. Synthesis. We demonstrate that strong niche differentiation, widespread facilitation between phytoplanktonic taxa and stabilizing covariances between interaction strengths should be common features of coexisting phytoplankton communities in the field. These are structural properties that we can expect to emerge from plausible mechanistic models of phytoplankton communities. We discuss mechanisms, such as predation or restricted microscale movement, that are consistent with these findings, which paves the way for further research.","2020","JUN 2020","10.1111/1365-2745.13410","WOS:000539744200001"

The plant microbiome affects the plant's absorption of nutrient elements, improves plant tolerance to negative environmental factors, increases the accumulation of active components, and alters tissue texture. The microbial community is also important for the accumulation of secondary metabolites by plants. However, there are few studies on the niche differentiation of endophytic microorganisms of plants, especially at different elevations. Methods: We investigated the effects of altitude on the community composition of endophytic fungal communities and the differentiation of endophytic microorganisms among different niches in Paris polyphylla Sm. The rhizosphere soil, roots, rhizomes and leaves of wild-type P. polyphylla Sm. at different altitudes were sampled, and the fungal communities of all samples were analyzed by internal transcribed spacer one amplification sequencing. Results: The results showed that in rhizosphere soil, the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that could be classified or identified decreased significantly with increasing altitude, whereas in the endosphere of plants, the total number of OTUs was higher at intermediate altitudes than other altitudes. Furthermore, the structural variability in the rhizosphere fungal community was significantly lower than that in the endophytic communities. In addition, our results confirmed the presence of niche differentiation among members of the endophytic microbial community.

Across geologies, N mineralization and nitrification rates were slower in the autumn than the rest of the year. Turnover times for soil ammonium pools were <24 h, whilst several days for nitrate. In clay soils, bacterial, archaeal, AOA, and AOB communities were clearly distinct from those in Chalk and Greensand soils. Spatially and temporally, AOA were more abundant than AOB. Notably, Nitrososphaera were predominant, comprising 37.4% of archaeal communities, with the vast majority of AOA found in Chalk and Greensand soils.

Transcripts were binned using a unique reference database generated from soil isolate genomes, single-cell amplified genomes, metagenomes, and stable isotope probing metagenomes. While soil habitat significantly affected both community composition and overall gene expression, the succession of microbial functions occurred at a faster time scale than compositional changes. Using hierarchical clustering of upregulated decomposition genes, we identified four distinct microbial guilds populated by taxa whose functional succession patterns suggest specialization for substrates provided by fresh growing roots, decaying root detritus, the combination of live and decaying root biomass, or aging root material. Carbohydrate depolymerization genes were consistently upregulated in the rhizosphere, and both taxonomic and functional diversity were highest in the combined rhizosphere-detritusphere, suggesting coexistence of rhizosphere guilds is facilitated by niche differentiation.

Aggregate sizes significantly influenced the community structure of AOA and AOB, rather than comammox Nitrospira. However, organic fertilizers had a greater role in mediating the community structure of comammox Nitrospira, AOA, and AOB than aggregate sizes. Comammox Nitrospira clade A dominated in the tested soils, while pig manure application significantly increased the relative abundance of clade B, especially in microaggregates.

Their contributions to increasing N2O emissions are greatest in terrestrial environments, due to the dramatic and continuing increases in use of ammonia-based fertilizers, which have been driven by requirement for increased food production, but which also provide a source of energy for ammonia oxidizers (AO), leading to an imbalance in the terrestrial nitrogen cycle. Direct N2O production by AO results from several metabolic processes, sometimes combined with abiotic reactions. Physiological characteristics, including mechanisms for N2O production, vary within and between ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) and comammox bacteria and N2O yield of AOB is higher than in the other two groups. There is also strong evidence for niche differentiation between AOA and AOB with respect to environmental conditions in natural and engineered environments. In particular, AOA are favored by low soil pH and AOA and AOB are, respectively, favored by low rates of ammonium supply, equivalent to application of slow-release fertilizer, or high rates of supply, equivalent to addition of high concentrations of inorganic ammonium or urea. These differences between AOA and AOB provide the potential for better fertilization strategies that could both increase fertilizer use efficiency and reduce N2O emissions from agricultural soils. This article reviews research on the biochemistry, physiology and ecology of AO and discusses the consequences for AO communities subjected to different agricultural practices and the ways in which this knowledge, coupled with improved methods for characterizing communities, might lead to improved fertilizer use efficiency and mitigation of N2O emissions.","2020","NOV 2019","10.1111/gcb.14877","WOS:000499291300001"

Biomarkers such as bulk stable isotopes have proven to be powerful tools to elucidate trophic niches, but they may lack in resolution, particularly when spatiotemporal variability in a system is high. To close this gap, we investigated whether carbon isotope (delta C-13) patterns of essential amino acids (EAAs), also termed delta(13)C(AA)fingerprints, can characterize niche differentiation in a highly dynamic marine system. Specifically, we tested the ability of delta(13)C(AA)fingerprints to differentiate trophic niches among six functional groups and ten individual species in the Baltic Sea. We also tested whether fingerprints of the common zooplanktivorous fishes, herring and sprat, differ among four Baltic Sea regions with different biochemical conditions and phytoplankton assemblages. Additionally, we investigated how these results compared to bulk C and N isotope data for the same sample set. We found significantly different delta(13)C(AA)fingerprints among all six functional groups. Species differentiation was in comparison less distinct, due to partial convergence of the species' fingerprints within functional groups. Herring and sprat displayed region-specific delta(13)C(AA)fingerprints indicating that this approach could be used as a migratory marker. Niche metrics analyses showed that bulk isotope data had a lower power to differentiate between trophic niches than delta(13)C(AA)fingerprinting. We conclude that delta(13)C(AA)fingerprinting has a strong potential to advance our understanding of ecological niches, and trophic linkages from producers to higher trophic levels in dynamic marine systems.

Using a 44-year grassland fertilization experiment, we investigated community shifts of active nitrifiers by DNA-based stable isotope probing (SIP) of field soils that received no fertilization (CK), high levels of organic cattle manure (HC), and chemical N fertilization (CF). Incubation of DNA-SIP microcosms showed significant nitrification activities in CF and HC soils, whereas no activity occurred in CK soils. The 44 years of inorganic N fertilization selected only C-13-ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), whereas cattle slurry applications created a niche in which both ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and AOB could be actively C-13-labeled. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Nitrosospira sp. 62-like AOB dominated inorganically fertilized CF soils, while Nitrosospira sp. 41-like AOB were abundant in organically fertilized HC soils. The C-13-AOA in HC soils were affiliated with the 29i4 lineage. The C-13-nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) were dominated by both Nitrospira- and Nitrobacter-like communities in CF soils, and the latter was overwhelmingly abundant in HC soils. The C-13-labeled nitrifying communities in SIP microcosms of CF and HC soils were largely similar to those predominant under field conditions. These results provide direct evidence for a strong selection of distinctly active nitrifiers after 44 years of different fertilization regimes in the field. Our findings imply that niche differentiation of nitrifying communities could be assessed as a net result of microbial adaption over 44 years to inorganic and organic N fertilization in the field, where distinct nitrifiers have been shaped by intensified anthropogenic N input.","2020",NA,"10.1016/S1002-0160(19)60803-9","WOS:000502751600008"

Algal polysaccharides represent the most diverse and structurally complex class of these substrates, yet their role in shaping the microbial community composition is poorly understood. We investigated, whether polysaccharide utilization capabilities contribute to niche differentiation of Polaribacter spp. (class Flavobacteriia; known to include relevant polysaccharide-degraders) that were abundant during 2009-2012 spring algal blooms in the southern North Sea. We identified six distinct Polaribacter clades using phylogenetic and phylogenomic analyses, quantified their abundances via fluorescence in situ hybridization, compared metagenome-assembled genomes, and assessed in situ gene expression using metaproteomics. Four clades with distinct polysaccharide niches were dominating. Polaribacter 2-a comprised typical first responders featuring small genomes with limited polysaccharide utilization capacities. Polaribacter 3-a were abundant only in 2010 and possessed a distinct sulfated alpha-glucoronomannan degradation potential. Polaribacter 3-b responded late in blooms and had the capacity to utilize sulfated xylan. Polaribacter 1-a featured high numbers of glycan degradation genes and were particularly abundant following Chattonella algae blooms.

Yet, soil microbial network assembly in mountain ecosystems and its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we characterized soil microbial co-occurrence networks across 12 altitudinal sites in Mountain Gongga. Despite differences in habitats, soil bacterial networks separated into two different clusters by altitude, namely the lower and higher altitudes, while fungi did not show such a pattern. Bacterial networks encompassed more complex and closer relationships at the lower altitudes, while fungi had closer relationships at the higher altitudes, which could be attributed to niche differentiation caused by high variations in soil environments and plant communities. Both abiotic and biotic factors (e.g. soil pH and bacterial community composition) shaped bacterial networks. However, biotic factors played more important roles than the measured abiotic factors for fungal network assembly. Further analyses suggest that multiple mechanisms including niche overlap/differentiation, cross-feeding and competition between microorganisms could play important roles in shaping soil microbial networks.

As precipitation patterns are altered by climate change, understanding the impact of soil hydrology on community structure and function is critical. In this work, water level was continuously monitored for over a year in a Midwestern prairie-wetland at 10 cm depth increments up to a depth of 120 cm in 10 locations. We analyzed microbiome composition and edaphic factors in soil cores collected from this unique spatially distributed, longitudinal data set. We demonstrate that the fraction of time that each sample was inundated explains more variability in diversity and composition across this site than other commonly assessed edaphic factors, such as soil pH or depth. Finally, we show that these compositional changes influence abundance of ammonia oxidizers. The observed patterns in community composition and diversity are fundamentally regulated by the interaction of water with a structured landscape, particularly an elevated sand ridge characterized by drier conditions and a lower-lying wetland with more clayey soils.

Benthic diatom traits were identified in all possible niche types (14% non-marginal-narrow, 37% non-marginal-broad, 8% marginal-narrow and 41% marginal-broad niche). On the basis of increased niche differentiation, it is possible to achieve an improved and more effective utilization of the eco-morphological concept of diatom traits. The relationships between the occupancy, abundance and niche characteristics suggest that the broader the niche, the wider the distribution and the greater the LA; the more marginal the NP, the more restricted spatially the distribution and the lower the LA.

However, how BSC developments drive the dynamics of soil prokaryotic and fungal community similarities and community assemblages remain fully elusive. Here, we evaluated the variations of microbial taxonomic and phylogenetic similarities with the developmental stages of BSC. Results showed that prokaryotic communities tended to be convergent in later BSC stages, mainly driven by the environmental filtering through nutrient accumulation.

Most prokaryotic generalists (e.g., Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Thaumarcaeota) and generalists of lichenized fungi were more abundant in later BSC stages.

BSC development promoted the abundances of prokaryotic generalists, but reduced prokaryotic specialists and both fungal generalists and specialists through increasing primary productivity. Additionally, prokaryotic co-occurrence networks (Co-MENs) tended to be less complex and less connected.

Taking advantage of the increasing availability of microbiome data, many computational approaches have been developed to infer bacterial interactions from the co-occurrence of microbes across diverse microbial communities. Additionally, the introduction of genome-scale metabolic models have also enabled the inference of cooperative and competitive metabolic interactions between bacterial species. By nature, phylogenetically similar microbial species are more likely to share common functional profiles or biological pathways due to their genomic similarity. Without properly factoring out the phylogenetic relationship, any estimation of the competition and cooperation between species based on functional/pathway profiles may bias downstream applications. To address these challenges, we developed a novel approach for estimating the competition and complementarity indices for a pair of microbial species, adjusted by their phylogenetic distance. An automated pipeline, PhyloMint, was implemented to construct competition and complementarity indices from genome scale metabolic models derived from microbial genomes. Application of our pipeline to 2,815 human-gut associated bacteria showed high correlation between phylogenetic distance and metabolic competition/cooperation indices among bacteria. Using a discretization approach, we were able to detect pairs of bacterial species with cooperation scores significantly higher than the average pairs of bacterial species with similar phylogenetic distances. A network community analysis of high metabolic cooperation but low competition reveals distinct modules of bacterial interactions.

Our findings highlight that cropping system not only affects the flux of root C into soil mesofauna, being slower in rape than in grass and willow, but also the utilization of root-derived resources by functional groups and species of Collembola. The results indicate that pronounced differences in belowground C inputs between cropping systems affect microbivores as basal species and thereby soil food webs and their functioning and services.","2020","MAY 2020","10.1007/s00374-020-01467-8","WOS:000530773200001"

Natural killer (NK) cells are important antiviral effectors that adapt to HCMV infection by expansion of virus-specific effector/memory cells. The impact of HCMV infection on the development of NK cells and innate lymphoid cells (ILC) in general is less well understood. In this context, we have recently established a novel in vitro platform to study human NK cell development in a stem cell niche based on human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Here, the system was modified by infecting MSC with HCMV to study the influence of virus infection on NK/ILC development. We show that cord blood-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells are successfully differentiated into mature CD56(+)CD94(+)NKG2A(+) NK cells on HCMV-infected MSC with significant higher anti-viral cytokine production compared to NK cells developing on non-infected MSC. Furthermore, the generation of ILC3, characterized by expression of the signature transcription factor RAR-related orphan receptor gamma (ROR gamma t) and the production of IL-22, was strongly impaired by HCMV infection. These observations are clinically relevant, given that ILC3 are associated with protection from graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) following stem cell transplantation and HCMV reactivation in turn is associated with increased incidence of GvHD.","2020",NA,"10.3390/jcm9010010","WOS:000515388400010"

We examined how habitat type and habitat diversity affects denitrification and the abundance and diversity of denitrifying and N2O reducing communities in illuminated shallow-water sediments. In a mesocosm experiment, cores from four habitats were incubated in different combinations, representing ecosystems with different habitat diversities. We hypothesized that habitat diversity promotes the diversity of N2O reducing communities and genetic potential for denitrification, thereby influencing denitrification rates. We also hypothesized that this will depend on the identity of the habitats. Habitat diversity positively affected ecosystem-level diversity of clade II N2O reducing communities, however neither clade I nosZ communities nor denitrification activity were affected. The composition of N2O reducing communities was determined by habitat type, and functional gene abundances indicated that silty mud and sandy sediments had higher genetic potentials for denitrification and N2O reduction than cyanobacterial mat and Ruppia maritima meadow sediments.

However, the diversity, function, and assembly of mangrove root-associated microbial communities along a continuous fine-scale niche remain elusive. Here, we applied amplicon and metagenome sequencing to investigate the bacterial and fungal communities among four compartments (nonrhizosphere, rhizosphere, episphere, and endosphere) of mangrove roots. We found different distribution patterns for both bacterial and fungal communities in all four root compartments, which could be largely due to niche differentiation along the root compartments and exudation effects of mangrove roots. The functional pattern for bacterial and fungal communities was also divergent within the compartments. The endosphere harbored more genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, lipid transport, and methane production, and fewer genes were found to be involved in sulfur reduction compared to other compartments. The dynamics of root-associated microbial communities revealed that 56-74% of endosphere bacterial taxa were derived from nonrhizosphere, whereas no fungal OTUs of nonrhizosphere were detected in the endosphere. This indicates that roots may play a more strictly selective role in the assembly of the fungal community compared to the endosphere bacterial community, which is consistent with the projections established in an amplification-selection model.

However, their distribution and compositional differences in different long-term flooded paddy fields (FPFs) management at different soil depths remains under-investigated. Using qPCR and phylogenetic analysis, this study investigated the abundance, niches, and compositional differences of AOA, AOB, and MOB along with their potential nitrification and oxidation rate in three soil layers from three FPFs (ShaPingBa (SPB), HeChuan (HC), and JiDi (JD)) in Chongqing, China. In all the FPFs, CH4 oxidation occurred mainly in the surface (0-3 cm) and subsurface layers (3-5 cm). A significant difference in potential methane oxidation and nitrification rates was observed among the three FPFs, in which SPB had the highest. The higher amoA genes are the marker for abundance of AOA compared to AOB while pmoA genes, which is the marker for MOB abundance and diversity, indicated their significant role in the nitrification process across the three FPFs. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that AOA were mainly composed of Nitrososphaera, Nitrosospumilus, and Nitrosotalea, while the genus Nitrosomonas accounted for the greatest proportion of AOB in the three soil layers. MOB were mainly composed of Methylocaldum and Methylocystis genera.

Soil aggregates of different size are known to promote niche differentiation. Moreover, aggregates differ in physical and chemical properties, therewith likely supporting biological diversity in soil. To evaluate whether different types of aggregates affect bacterial colonization, we analyzed the impact of aggregate size in dependence of soil clay content on the bacterial community composition. A further distinction was made between microaggregates that occur as free structures in the soil matrix and those that exist occluded within macroaggregates. Upon size fractionation of soil samples from a clay catena (19 - 34%), we analyzed the bacterial community composition in ten different aggregate fractions by amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Both the aggregate size and the clay content showed an influence on the bacterial community composition, although this influence explained only a minor amount of the total observed variation across all samples (approx. 10% each). The increasing clay content led to more distinct communities in aggregates of different size, especially the smallest microaggregate fractions (< 20 lim) became more distinct. This is explained by enhanced aggregate stability in soils of increasing clay content, resulting in the development of more distinct bacterial communities over time. Indicator species analysis revealed a preferential enrichment of copiotrophic bacteria in free microaggregates, while oligotrophic bacteria were enriched in occluded microaggregates, indicating that a further differentiation of the bacterial community occurs within this specific aggregate size fraction in dependence on the localization of the microaggregates in the soil matrix, being possibly related to differences in organic carbon quality. These findings show that further aggregate traits besides size, i.e. stability mediated by soil clay content and localization in the soil matrix, contribute to the diversification of bacterial communities in soil.","2020",NA,"10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114544","WOS:000558138300037"

However, the mechanisms underlying the coexistence of methane-cycling microbial communities remain largely elusive. Here, high-resolution sediment incubation experiments revealed a cryptic methane cycle in the South China Sea (SCS) methane seep ecosystem, showing the coexistence of sulfate (SO42-)- or iron (Fe)-dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) and methylotrophic methanogenesis. This previously unrecognized methane cycling is not discernible from geochemical profiles due to high net methane consumption. High-throughput sequencing and Catalyzed Reporter Deposition-Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (CARD-FISH) results suggested that anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea (ANME)-2 and -3 coupled to sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) carried out SO42--AOM, and alternative ANME-2 and -3 solely or coupled to iron-reducing bacteria (IRB) might participate in Fe-AOM in sulfate-depleted environments. This finding suggested that ANME could alter AOM metabolic pathways according to geochemical changes. Furthermore, the majority of methylotrophic methanogens belonged toMethanimicrococcus, and hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogens were likely inhibited by sulfate or iron respiration.

Illumina-based amplicon sequencing of the V4-region of the 16S rRNA gene revealed a high microbial diversity with 1000-2500 species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in all biofilters with the highest diversity in the brackish RAS. Proteobacteria, Bacteriodetes, Plantomycetes, Chloroflexi and Nitrospirae represented the most abundant phyla. 76 out of 674 known genera occurred in all nine biofilters and were defined as core-taxa, including nitrifying bacteria (Nitrosomonas and Nitrospira) as well as members of the (heterotrophic) genera Planctomyces, Blastopirellula, Nannocystis and Lewinella. Nitrifying communities composed of different, closely related and so far uncultured members of Nitrosomonas and Nitrospira were identified, strongly indicating that several potentially novel ammonia and nitrite oxidizing species are present in RAS biofilters. Relatives of known comammox Nitrospira were detected in the brackish biofilters, revealing 94-99 % identity of the 16S rRNA gene sequence to Ns. inopinata. Salinity tolerance tests with biocarriers derived from biofilters of the three distinct RAS showed an unexpected broad physiological flexibility with regard to salinity. Nitrification performance of freshwater nitrifiers was drastically reduced with increasing salinity and nearly completely inhibited at 15 PSU, while the brackish and marine nitrifiers showed a high resistance and maintained nitrification activity in a broad range of salt concentrations.

Different Protea species contain sympatric populations of different fungal species. For example, P. repens host S. splendens and K. proteae, while P. neriifolia host K. capensis and S. phasma. Even though all fungi can grow vigorously on alternative hosts and they share the same spore vector species, they rarely colonise alternative hosts. We investigated the role of fungal differential competitive abilities on their usual and alternative hosts to explain their host exclusivity. In a de Wit replacement series experiment, S. splendens outcompeted and later overgrew all other fungi on media prepared from its usual and alternative hosts. Host exclusivity of S. splendens on P. repens may therefore be maintained by restricted movement of spore vectors rather than weaker competitive abilities on alternative hosts. On their preferred hosts, S. splendens and S. phasma rapidly overgrew Knoxdavesia species with which they do not usually share a host, explaining host exclusivity of the Knoxdavesia species. Knoxdaviesia proteae likely only persist on P. repens with sympatric S. splendens if it colonizes flowers earlier, in a different area, or completes its life cycle before being overgrown. On their usual P. neriifolia host, K. capensis and S. phasma had neutralistic interactions and S. phasma could not overgrow K. capensis, explaining their co-existence. Host exclusivity of saprobic Protea-associated Knoxdaviesia and Sporothrix may therefore be maintained by both the activities of spore vectors and differential competitive abilities on different hosts, but the influence of other competing microbes and micro-niche differentiation cannot be excluded.","2020","NOV 2020","10.1007/s10482-020-01491-6","WOS:000591542100001"

Both soils were subjected to manipulations of pH and moisture content in a microcosm experiment, to understand if similar environmental and biotic factors governed denitrification rates in the two ecosystems, and how these factors were linked to denitrification rates. Bacterial communities containing nirK, nirS, and nosZ-I all had distinct composition in the agricultural compared to the wetland soil, with nirK and nirS community composition being particularly distinct compared to that of nosZ-I. Lowering soil pH decreased gene abundance and altered the composition of nirK and nirS in both soils and increased the N2O: (N-2 + N2O) ratio in agricultural soil. Re-wetting soil for the experimental manipulations led to increased denitrification rate in the agricultural soil but had no effect on the denitrification rate measured in the wetland soil. We found that the combination of abiotic variables, gene abundance, and diversity measures predicted denitrification better than any of these factors alone, showing the importance of including microbial measures for predicting denitrification. The manipulations of these soils provided evidence for niche differences between the homologous nirK and nirS genes. Notably, nirS abundance was more highly correlated to activity in higher pH soils, while nirK abundance was more correlated to activity in low pH soils. We show that nirK and nirS do not behave and contribute equally to denitrification under these varying conditions.","2020",NA,"10.1016/j.apsoil.2020.103521","WOS:000523298300002"

Biofilms can adversely impact the provision of safe and biologically stable water. Moreover, there is a general lack of understanding of the role of microbial communities in DWDS in regions with warm temperatures and no distinct seasons. Here, we report a survey on biofilms from full-scale monochloraminated DWDS in a highly urbanised metropolis using next generation sequencing tools. The monitoring campaign consisted of sampling biofilms and bulk waters from 21 in-service pipes. We characterized the microbial community with emphasis on nitrifying bacteria and archaea using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and potential nitrification activity. Samples grouped into two clusters, characterized by their low (Cluster LD) and high (Cluster HD) alpha-diversity. Both clusters harbour microorganisms related to nitrification: i) Nitrosomonas (24.9e68.8%), an ammonia oxidising bacterium (AOB) that dominated Cluster LD, and ii) a co-aggregation of genus Nitrospira (9.8-32.5%), a nitrite oxidising bacterium (NOB), and Thaumarchaeota (1.4-10.9%), chemolithotrophic ammonia oxidising (AOA) archaea that were among the most abundant OTUs in Cluster HD. Activity tests performed with fresh biofilm samples confirmed that these two clusters represent distinctive biofilm niches performing different stages of the nitrification process. Cluster LD correlated with a high concentration of MCA, which caused dysbiosis and resulted in high unevenness of the cluster. In cluster HD, with more biomass, chemical reactions involving nitrite increased the MCA demand, releasing ammonia and allowing more nitrifiers to grow, like AOA and NOB. From this study, we conclude that an MCA residual gradient along the DWDS drives and shapes the microbial community assembly and should be considered when designing effective disinfection strategies.

The present study evaluated the interactions between acetate-induced heterotrophs and the nitrosifying community using network analysis and the culture-dependence method. Bacterial succession as well as shifts in the community structure occurred as a result of the bloom of heterotrophs. The acetate-induced heterotrophs enhanced reactor productivity and stability, thus increasing the ammonium removal efficiency in comparison to that of the control reactor from day 270 onward (88.9 +/- 10.0 vs 60.0 +/- 10.9%, P < 0.01). Interestingly, the sludge nitritation rates in the acetate-amended reactor (125.6 +/- 33.1 mg-N/(L h)) were much higher than those in the control reactor (81.7 +/- 22.4 mg-N/(L h), P < 0.01) at stages IV and V, implying that the induced heterotrophs can enhance nitritation. The sequencing data showed that the presence of acetate decreased potential competition and led to increased niche differentiation among various bacteria, e.g., some of the acetate-induced members of the community favored the proliferation of AOB. Network analysis revealed that the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to the genus Arenimonas or Thauera interacted with the OTU of the genus Nitrosomonas differently.

Tricine-SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF MS analysis showed some differences in protein and peptide profiles. Final products obtained using L. helveticus T105 exhibited the greatest amount of free amino acids, which are important precursor of cheese aroma and flavor.

However, the relative contributions of different ammonia oxidizers to soil nitrification are poorly understood. Materials and methods Soil samples were collected from five land use types (i.e., cropland, grassland, bushland, transition land, and forest land) from a subtropical soil in Yunnan Province, Southwest China. The quantitative distribution of comammox Nitrospira, AOA and AOB in soils was firstly investigated using the QPCR approach and three of which (cropland, transition land and forest land) with pH below 6 were further examined using DNA stable isotope probing approach with (CO2)-C-13.

Results and discussion The results showed that the amoA gene abundance of ammonia oxidizers except AOB was significantly lower in croplands than other land uses. Based on the (CO2)-C-13 labeling method, AOA, rather than AOB or comammox Nitrospira, was found to incorporate (CO2)-C-13 into their genomes during the incubation in cropland and transition land but not in forest land, suggesting the dominant role of AOA in ammonia oxidation. Phylogenetic analysis of the active AOA group revealed that autotrophic AOA community was mainly affiliated with the cluster of Nitrososphaera in transition land, whereas Nitrososphaera, Nitrosopumilus, and Nitrosotalea in cropland.

However, direct evidence for niche specialization of microorganisms in association with soil pH is still lacking. Using methane-oxidizing bacteria (methanotrophs) as a model system of C cycling, we show that pH is potentially the key driving force selecting for canonical gamma (type I) and alpha (type II) methanotrophs in rice paddy soils. DNA-based stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) was combined with high-throughput sequencing to reveal the taxonomic identities of active methanotrophs in physiochemically contrasting soils from six different paddy fields across China. Following microcosm incubation amended with (CH4)-C-13, methane was primarily consumed by Methylocystis-affiliated type II methanotrophs in soils with a relatively low pH (5.44-6.10), whereas Methylobacter- or Methylosarcina-affiliated type I methanotrophs dominated methane consumption in soils with a high pH (7.02-8.02). Consumption of (CH4)-C-13 contributed 0.203% to 1.25% of soil organic C, but no significant difference was observed between high-pH and low-pH soils. The fertilization of ammonium nitrate resulted in no significant changes in the compositions of C-13-labeled methanotrophs in the soils, although significant inhibition of methane oxidation activity was consistently observed in low-pH soils. Mantel analysis further validated that soil pH, rather than other parameters tested, had significant correlation to the variation in active methanotrophic compositions across different rice paddy soils. These results suggest that soil pH might have played a pivotal role in mediating the niche differentiation of ecologically important aerobic methanotrophs in terrestrial ecosystems and imply the importance of such niche specialization in regulating methane emissions in paddy fields following increasingly intensified input of anthropogenic N fertilizers.","2020",NA,"10.5194/bg-17-1451-2020","WOS:000521640600002"

In this study, surface sediments collected from areas of Taihu Lake (China) with different degrees of eutrophication were incubated under three levels of nitrogen input and temperature, and the autotrophic growth of ammonia oxidizers was assessed using C-13-labeled DNA-based stable-isotope probing (SIP), while communities were characterized using MiSeq sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA genes. Nitrification rates in sediment microcosms were positively correlated with nitrogen inputs, but there was no marked association with temperature. Incubation of SIP microcosms indicated that AOA and AOB amoA genes were labeled by C-13 at 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C in the slightly eutrophic sediment, and AOB amoA genes were labeled to a much greater extent than AOA amoA genes in the moderately eutrophic sediment after 56 days. Phylogenetic analysis of C-13-labeled 165 rRNA genes revealed that the active AOA were mainly affiliated with the Nitrosopumilus cluster, with the Nitrososphaera cluster dominating in the slightly eutrophic sediment at 30 degrees C with low ammonium input (1 mM). Active AOB communities were more sensitive to nitrogen input and temperature than were AOA communities, and they were exclusively dominated by the Nitrosornonas cluster, which tended to be associated with Nitrosomonadaceae-like lineages. Nitrosomonas sp. strain Is79A3 tended to dominate the moderately eutrophic sediment at 10 degrees C with greater ammonium input (2.86 mM). The relative abundance responses of the major active communities to nitrogen input and temperature gradients varied, indicating niche differentiation and differences in the physiological metabolism of ammonia oxidizers that are yet to be described. IMPORTANCE Both archaea and bacteria contribute to ammonia oxidation, which plays a central role in the global cycling of nitrogen and is important for reducing eutrophication in freshwater environments. The abundance and activities of ammoniaoxidizing archaea and bacteria in eutrophic limnic sediments vary with different ammonium concentrations or with seasonal shifts, and how the two factors affect nitrification activity, microbial roles, and active groups in different eutrophic sediments is unclear. The significance of our research is in identifying the archaeal and bacterial responses to anthropogenic activity and climate change, which will greatly enhance our understanding of the physiological metabolic differences of ammonia oxidizers.","2019",NA,"10.1128/AEM.00258-19","WOS:000483596700001"

We explored how dominant plant species take up ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-), and glycine under conditions of warming and soil degradation in alpine grasslands. Materials and methods Open-top chambers were used to simulate warming in degraded and non-degraded plots in an alpine grassland ecosystem on the Tibetan Plateau. Plant species were selected in both non-degraded (Kobresia pygmaea and Aster tataricus) and degraded (Aster tataricus and Chenopodium glaucum) plots. Short-term N-15-labeling experiments with NH4+-N, NO3--N, and glycine ((CN)-C-13-N-15-glycine) were conducted in each of four subplots with water alone as the control. Results and discussion All of the selected plant species took up both organic and inorganic forms of N in the K. pygmaea grassland. Warming increased the uptake of glycine-N by the dominant species, whereas the uptake of NH4+-N by the non-dominant species increased in both non-degraded and degraded grasslands. Warming changed the N uptake preference of A. tataricus from NO3--N to NH4+-N in non-degraded grasslands, but did not change the preference of A. tataricus under degraded conditions. This suggests that degradation can affect the preference of different plant species for particular forms of N as a response to warming. Conclusions Plants in K. pygmaea grasslands take up organic N, although inorganic N is the dominant form of N used. The effects of warming on the uptake of N by plants varied with species, the form of N, and the degradation of the grassland. Degradation modified the effect of warming on the preference of plants for different forms of N. Different plant species developed different patterns for the uptake of N in both non-degraded and degraded plots, which may facilitate their coexistence in alpine grasslands.","2019",NA,"10.1007/s11368-019-02255-0","WOS:000464836300007"
"Van Ende, M; Wijnants, S; Van Dijck, P","Sugar Sensing and Signaling in Candida albicans and Candida glabrata","FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY","Candida species, such as Candida albicans and Candida glabrata, cause infections at different host sites because they adapt their metabolism depending on the available nutrients. They are able to proliferate under both nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor conditions. This adaptation is what makes these fungi successful pathogens. For both species, sugars are very important nutrients and as the sugar level differs depending on the host niche, different sugar sensing systems must be present. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used as a model for the identification of these sugar sensing systems. One of the main carbon sources for yeast is glucose, for which three different pathways have been described. First, two transporter-like proteins, ScSnf3 and ScRgt2, sense glucose levels resulting in the induction of different hexose transporter genes. This situation is comparable in C. albicans and C. glabrata, where sensing of glucose by CaHgt4 and CgSnf3, respectively, also results in hexose transporter gene induction. The second glucose sensing mechanism in S. cerevisiae is via the G-protein coupled receptor ScGpr1, which causes the activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway, resulting in rapid adaptation to the presence of glucose. The main components of this glucose sensing system are also conserved in C. albicans and C. glabrata. However, it seems that the ligand(s) for CaGpr1 are not sugars but lactate and methionine. In C. glabrata, this pathway has not yet been investigated. Finally, the glucose repression pathway ensures repression of respiration and repression of the use of alternative carbon sources. This pathway is not well characterized in Candida species. It is important to note that, apart from glucose, other sugars and sugar-analogs, such as N-acetylglucosamine in the case of C. albicans, are also important carbon sources. In these fungal pathogens, sensing sugars is important for a number of virulence attributes, including adhesion, oxidative stress resistance, biofilm formation, morphogenesis, invasion, and antifungal drug tolerance. In this review, the sugar sensing and signaling mechanisms in these Candida species are compared to S. cerevisiae.","2019",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2019.00099","WOS:000457232500001"

Within the dominant bacterial groups, Flavobacterales, Rhodobacterales, Actinomarinales, and SAR86 were more abundant in epipelagic waters and decreased with depth, whereas SAR11, SAR324, Marinimicrobia, and Thiomicrospirales increased their contribution to the bacterial community with depth. Nitrosopumilaceae also increased with depth and dominated the OMZ and bathypelagic archaeal communities. Euryarchaeota Marine Group II exhibited an opposite depth pattern to Nitrosopumilaceae, whereas Marine Group III and Woesearchaeota were more abundant in the bathypelagic realm. Candidatus Brocadia contributed 70-100% of the anammox bacterial community throughout the water column. Archaeal ammonia oxidizers (AOA) dominated the microbial community involved in the nitrogen cycle. Two AOA ecotypes, the high ammonia (HAC) and low ammonia (LAC)-AOA, characterized by distinct genes for aerobic ammonia oxidation (amoA) and for denitrification (nirK), exhibited a distinct distribution pattern related to depth and ammonia concentrations. HAC-AOA dominated in epipelagic (80.5 +/- 28.3% of total AOA) oxygenated and ammonia-rich waters, and LAC-AOA dominated in the OMZ (90.9 +/- 5.1%) and bathypelagic waters (85.5 +/- 13.5%), characterized by lower oxygen and ammonia concentrations. Bacterial denitrifiers (3.7 +/- 6.9 bacterial nirK gene mL(-1)) and anaerobic ammonia oxidizers (78 +/- 322 anammox 16S rRNA genes L-1) were low in abundance under the oxygen conditions in the Gulf of Alaska throughout the water column. The widespread distribution of bacterial denitrifiers and anaerobic ammonia oxidizers in low abundances reveals a reservoir of genetic and metabolic potential ready to colonize the environment under the predicted increase of OMZs in the ocean. Taken together, our results reinforce the niche partitioning of archaeal ammonia oxidizers based on their distinct metabolic characteristics resulting in the dominance of LAC-AOA in a high latitude deep OMZ. Considering the different ecological roles and functions of the two archaeal ecotypes, the expansion of the zones dominated by the LAC-ecotype might have implications for the nitrogen cycle in the future ocean.","2019",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2019.02141","WOS:000485654200002"

Although Hafnia is fairly often isolated from clinical material, its taxonomy has remained an unsolved riddle, and the involvement and importance of Hafnia in human disease is also uncertain. Here, we used comparative genomic analysis to define the taxonomy of Hafnia, identify species-specific genes that may be the result of ecological and pathogenic specialization, and reveal virulence-related genetic profiles that may contribute to pathogenesis. Results One complete genome sequence and 19 draft genome sequences for Hafnia strains were generated and combined with 27 publicly available genomes. We provided high-resolution typing methods by constructing phylogeny and population structure based on single-copy core genes in combination with whole genome average nucleotide identity to identify two distant Hafnia species (alvei and paralvei) and one mislabeled strain. The open pan-genome and the presence of numerous mobile genetic elements reveal that Hafnia has undergone massive gene rearrangements. Presence of species-specific core genomes associated with metabolism and transport suggests the putative niche differentiation between alvei and paralvei. We also identified possession of diverse virulence-related profiles in both Hafnia species., including the macromolecular secretion system, virulence, and antimicrobial resistance. In the macromolecular system, T1SS, Flagellum 1, Tad pilus and T6SS-1 were conserved in Hafnia, whereas T4SS, T5SS, and other T6SSs exhibited the evolution of diversity. The virulence factors in Hafnia are related to adherence, toxin, iron uptake, stress adaptation, and efflux pump. The identified resistance genes are associated with aminoglycoside, beta-lactam, bacitracin, cationic antimicrobial peptide, fluoroquinolone, and rifampin. These virulence-related profiles identified at the genomic level provide insights into Hafnia pathogenesis and the differentiation between alvei and paralvei. Conclusions Our research using core genome phylogeny and comparative genomics analysis of a larger collection of strains provides a comprehensive view of the taxonomy and species-specific traits between Hafnia species. Deciphering the genome of Hafnia strains possessing a reservoir of macromolecular secretion systems, virulence factors, and resistance genes related to pathogenicity may provide insights into addressing its numerous infections and devising strategies to combat the pathogen.","2019",NA,"10.1186/s12864-019-6123-1","WOS:000494655200001"

In one of the largest seasonally ice-free regions, the Amundsen Sea Polynya, pelagic samples were collected from 15 sites during a massive Phaeocystis antarctica bloom in 2010/2011. Along with a suite of other biotic and abiotic measurements, bacterioplankton were collected and analyzed for community structure by pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The aims were to identify patterns in diversity and composition of heterotrophic bacterioplankton and to test mechanistic hypotheses for explaining these differences along variations in depth, water mass, phytoplankton biomass, and organic and inorganic nutrients. The overall goal was to darify the relationship between primary producers and bacterioplankton community structure in the Southern Ocean. Results suggested that both epipelagic and mesopelagic bacterioplankton communities were structured by phytoplankton blooming in the euphotic zone. As chlorophyll a (chl-a) increased in surface waters, the abundance of surface bacterioplankton increased, but their diversity decreased. Similarity in bacterioplankton community composition between surface-water sites increased as the bloom progressed, suggesting that algal blooms may homogenize surface-water bacterioplankton communities at larger spatial scales. Below the euphotic zone, the opposite relationship was found. Mesopelagic bacterioplankton diversity increased with increasing chl-a in the overlying surface waters. This shift may be promoted by several factors induding local increase in organic and inorganic nutrients from particles sinking out of the euphotic zone, an increase in niche differentiation associated with the particle flux, interactions with deep-dwelling macrozooplankton, and release from competition with primary producers. Additional multivariate analyses of bacterioplankton community structure and nutrient concentrations revealed distinct depth horizons, with bacterioplankton communities having maximum alpha and beta diversity just below the euphotic zone, while nutrient composition gradually homogenized with increasing depth. Our results provide evidence for bloom-driven (bottom-up) control of bacterioplankton community diversity in the coastal Southern Ocean and suggest mechanisms whereby surface processes can shape the diversity of bacterioplankton communities at great depth.","2019",NA,"10.1002/ecs2.2641","WOS:000463977000027"

We investigated Baltic Sea sediments with single-cell genomics, metabolomics, metatranscriptomics, and enzyme assays to identify possible subsistence mechanisms employed by uncultured Atribacteria, Aminicenantes, Actinobacteria group OPB41, Aerophobetes, Chloroflexi, Deltaproteobacteria, Desulfatiglans, Bathyarchaeota, and Euryarchaeota marine group II lineages. Some functions appeared to be shared by multiple lineages, such as trehalose production and NAD(+)-consuming deacetylation, both of which have been shown to increase cellular life spans in other organisms by stabilizing proteins and nucleic acids, respectively. Other possible subsistence mechanisms differed between lineages, possibly providing them different physiological niches. Enzyme assays and transcripts suggested that Atribacteria and Actinobacteria group OPB41 catabolized sugars, whereas Aminicenantes and Atribacteria catabolized peptides. Metabolite and transcript data suggested that Atribacteria utilized allantoin, possibly as an energetic substrate or chemical protectant, and also possessed energy-efficient sodium pumps. Atribacteria single-cell amplified genomes (SAGs) recruited transcripts for full pathways for the production of all 20 canonical amino acids, and the gene for amino acid exporter YddG was one of their most highly transcribed genes, suggesting that they may benefit from metabolic interdependence with other cells. Subsistence of uncultured phyla in deep subsurface sediments may occur through shared strategies of using chemical protectants for biomolecular stabilization, but also by differentiating into physiological niches and metabolic interdependencies. IMPORTANCE Much of life on Earth exists in a very slow-growing state, with microbes from deeply buried marine sediments representing an extreme example. These environments are like natural laboratories that have run multi-thousand-year experiments that are impossible to perform in a laboratory. We borrowed some techniques that are commonly used in laboratory experiments and applied them to these natural samples to make hypotheses about how these microbes subsist for so long at low activity. We found that some methods for stabilizing proteins and nucleic acids might be used by many members of the community. We also found evidence for niche differentiation strategies, and possibly cross-feeding, suggesting that even though they are barely growing, complex ecological interactions continue to occur over ultralong timescales.","2019",NA,"10.1128/mBio.02376-18","WOS:000465077600013"

Niche theory predicts that strong selection pressure should simplify assemblages as species are extirpated and taxa pre-adapted for the new environment thrive. Here, we use dosed mesocosms to test the prediction that higher temperatures decrease species richness and increase assemblage similarity more and faster than lower temperatures. We incubated two temperate forest soil types at constant temperatures from 10 degrees to 35 degrees, destructively sampling mesocosms at 30, 180, and 440 d. We quantified taxonomic richness and assemblage similarity of soil bacteria using 16S rRNA gene amplicons. As predicted, mesocosms at higher temperatures lost more taxa than those at lower temperature. Contrary to predictions, the simplified assemblages at higher temperatures became less similar to each other over time. After 440 d of incubation, the number of taxa lost was a linear function of the difference between treatment temperature and site mean annual temperature, while assemblage similarity decreased as an accelerating function of this temperature difference.","2019",NA,"10.1002/ecs2.2598","WOS:000461577000021"

To date, known bacterial methanotrophs belong to the Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and NC10 phyla. Within the Proteobacteria phylum, they can be divided into type la, type Ib, and type II methanotrophs. Type la and type II are well represented by isolates. Contrastingly, the vast majority of type Ib methanotrophs have not been able to be cultivated so far. Here, we compared the distributions of type Ib lineages in different environments. Whereas the cultivated type Ib methanotrophs (Methylococcus and Methylocaldum) are found in landfill and upland soils, lineages that are not represented by isolates are mostly dominant in freshwater environments, such as paddy fields and lake sediments. Thus, we observed a clear niche differentiation within type Ib methanotrophs. Our subsequent isolation attempts resulted in obtaining a pure culture of a novel type Ib methanotroph, tentatively named Methylotetracoccus oryzae C50C1. Strain C50C1 was further characterized to be an obligate methanotroph, containing C-16(:1)omega 9c as the major membrane phospholipid fatty acid, which has not been found in other methanotrophs. Genome analysis of strain C50C1 showed the presence of two pmoCAB operon copies and XoxF5-type methanol dehydrogenase in addition to MxaFI. The genome also contained genes involved in nitrogen and sulfur cycling, but it remains to be demonstrated if and how these help this type Ib methanotroph to adapt to fluctuating environmental conditions in freshwater ecosystems. IMPORTANCE Most of the methane produced on our planet gets naturally oxidized by a group of methanotrophic microorganisms before it reaches the atmosphere. These microorganisms are able to oxidize methane, both aerobically and anaerobically, and use it as their sole energy source. Although methanotrophs have been studied for more than a century, there are still many unknown and uncultivated groups prevalent in various ecosystems. This study focused on the diversity and adaptation of aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria in different environments by comparing their phenotypic and genotypic properties. We used lab-scale microcosms to create a countergradient of oxygen and methane for preenrichment, followed by classical isolation techniques to obtain methane-oxidizing bacteria from a freshwater environment. This resulted in the discovery and isolation of a novel methanotroph with interesting physiological and genomic properties that could possibly make this bacterium able to cope with fluctuating environmental conditions.","2019",NA,"10.1128/mSphere.00631-18","WOS:000475754600015"

Exiguobacterium can grow in a wide range of temperature, pH, salinity, and heavy-metal concentrations. We characterized Exiguobacterium chiriqhucha strain RW2 isolated from a permanently cold freshwater microbialite in Pavilion Lake, British Columbia using metabolic assays, genomics, comparative genomics, phylogenetics, and fatty acid composition. Strain RW2 has the most extensive growth range for temperature (4-50 degrees C) and pH (5-11) of known Exiguobacterium isolates. Strain RW2 genome predicts pathways for wide differential thermal, cold and osmotic stress using cold and heat shock cascades (e.g., csp and dnaK), choline and betaine uptake/biosynthesis (e.g., opu and proU), antiporters (e.g., arcD and nhaC Na+/K+), membrane fatty acid unsaturation and saturation. Here, we provide the first complete genome from Exiguobacterium chirighucha strain RW2, which was isolated from a freshwater microbialite. Its genome consists of a single 3,019,018 bp circular chromosome encoding over 3,000 predicted proteins, with a GC% content of 52.1%, and no plasmids. In addition to growing at a wide range of temperatures and salinities, our findings indicate that RW2 is resistant to sulfisoxazole and has the genomic potential for detoxification of heavy metals (via mercuric reductases, arsenic resistance pumps, chromate transporters, and cadmium-cobalt-zinc resistance genes), which may contribute to the metabolic potential of Pavilion Lake microbialites. Strain RW2 could also contribute to microbialite formation, as it is a robust biofilm former and encodes genes involved in the deamination of amino acids to ammonia (i.e., L-asparaginase/urease), which could potentially boost carbonate precipitation by lowering the local pH and increasing alkalinity. We also used comparative genomic analysis to predict the pathway for orange pigmentation that is conserved across the entire Exiguobacterium genus, specifically, a C-30 carotenoid biosynthesis pathway is predicted to yield diaponeurosporene-4-oic acid as its final product. Carotenoids have been found to protect against ultraviolet radiation by quenching reactive oxygen, releasing excessive light energy, radical scavenging, and sunscreening. Together these results provide further insight into the potential of Exiguobacteriurn to exploit a wide range of environmental conditions, its potential roles in ecosystems (e.g., microbialites/microbial mats), and a blueprint model for diverse metabolic processes.","2019",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2018.03189","WOS:000455117300001"

Most AOA lack the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-detoxifying enzyme catalase, and some AOA have been shown to grow poorly under conditions of exposure to H2O2. However, differences in the degrees of H2O2 sensitivity of different AOA strains, the physiological status of AOA cells exposed to H2O2, and their molecular response to H2O2 remain poorly characterized. Further, AOA might rely on heterotrophic bacteria to detoxify H2O2, and yet the extent and variety of costs and benefits involved in these interactions remain unclear. Here, we used a proteomics approach to compare the protein profiles of three Nitrosopumilus strains grown in the presence and absence of catalase and in coculture with the heterotrophic alphaproteobacterium Oceanicaulis alexandrii. We observed that most proteins detected at a higher relative abundance in H2O2 exposed Nitrosopumilus cells had no known function in oxidative stress defense. Instead, these proteins were putatively involved in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix, which we hypothesize to be a strategy limiting the influx of H2O2 into the cells. Using RNA-stable isotope probing, we confirmed that O. alexandrii cells growing in coculture with the Nitrosopumilus strains assimilated Nitrosopumilus-derived organic carbon, suggesting that AOA could recruit H2O2-detoxifying bacteria through the release of labile organic matter. Our results contribute new insights into the response of AOA to H2O2 and highlight the potential ecological importance of their interactions with heterotrophic free-living bacteria in marine environments. IMPORTANCE Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) are the most abundant chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms in the oxygenated water column of the global ocean. Although H2O2 appears to be a universal by-product of aerobic metabolism, genes encoding the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-detoxifying enzyme catalase are largely absent in genomes of marine AOA. Here, we provide evidence that closely related marine AOA have different degrees of sensitivity to H2O2, which may contribute to niche differentiation between these organisms. Furthermore, our results suggest that marine AOA rely on H2O2 detoxification during periods of high metabolic activity and release organic compounds, thereby potentially attracting heterotrophic prokaryotes that provide this missing function. In summary, this report provides insights into the metabolic interactions between AOA and heterotrophic bacteria in marine environments and suggests that AOA play an important role in the biogeochemical carbon cycle by making organic carbon available for heterotrophic microorganisms.","2019",NA,"10.1128/mSystems.00181-19","WOS:000482629400006"

VFAs induced the highest P release (12.0-18.2 mg P/g MLSS for acetate with a P release-to-carbon uptake (P:C) ratio of 0.35-0.66 mol P/mol C, 9.4-18.5 mg P/g MLSS for propionate with a P:C ratio of 0.38-0.60, and 9.5-17.3 mg P/g MLSS for n-butyrate), followed by some carboxylic acids (10.1-18.1 mg P/g MLSS for pyruvate, 4.5-11.7 mg P/g MLSS for lactate and 3.7-12.4 mg P/g MLSS for fumarate) and amino acids (3.66-7.33 mg P/g MLSS for glutamate with a P:C ratio of 0.16-0.43 mol P/mol C, and 4.01-7.37 mg P/g MLSS for aspartate with a P:C ratio of 0.17-0.48 mol P/mol C). P -release profiles (induced by different carbon sources) correlated closely with PAO community composition. High micro-diversity was observed within the Ca. Accumulibacter lineage, which represented the most abundant PAOs. The total population of Ca. Accumulibacter taxa was highly correlated with P-release induced by VFAs, highlighting the latter's importance in tropical EBPR systems. There was a strong link between the relative abundance of individual Ca. Accumulibacter OTUs and the extent of P release induced by distinct carbon sources (e.g., OTU 81 and amino acids, and OTU 246 and ethanol), suggesting niche differentiation among Ca. Accumulibacter taxa. A diverse PAO community and the ability to use numerous organic compounds are considered key factors for stable EBPR in full-scale plants at elevated temperatures.

However, it is unknown whether the composition of the microbiota is preserved during long-term stool storage (>1 year). We therefore evaluated the influence of long-term storage on the microbiota composition of human stool samples collected in RNAlater and stored for approximately five years at -80 degrees C. We compared storage effects on stool samples from 24 subjects with the effects of technical variation due to different sequencing runs and biological variation (intra-and inter-subject), in another 101 subjects, based on alpha-diversity, beta-diversity and taxonomic composition. We also evaluated the impact of initial alpha-diversity and fecal microbiota composition on beta-diversity instability upon storage. Overall, long-term stool storage at -80 degrees C had only limited effects on the microbiota composition of human feces. The magnitude of changes in alpha-and betadiversity and taxonomic composition after long-term storage was similar to inter-sequencing variation and smaller than biological variation (both intra- and inter-subject). The likelihood of fecal samples being affected by long-term storage correlated with the initial relative abundance of some genera and tend to be affected by initial taxonomic richness.","2019",NA,"10.1038/s41598-018-36953-5","WOS:000456554600040"

Therefore, more effort is required to improve the specific capabilities and achieve a long cycling life. The mild carbonization process in molten salt (NaCl-KCl) is used to synthesize nitrogen/oxygen co-doped hierarchically porous carbon (NOPC) for PIBs by using cyanobacteria as the carbon source. This exhibits highly reversible capacities and ultra-long cycling stability, retaining a capacity of 266 mA h g(-1) at 50 mA g(-1) (100 cycles) and presents a capacity of 104.3 mA h g(-1) at 1000 mA g(-1) (1000 cycles). Kinetics analysis reveals that the potassium ion (K+) storage of NOPC is controlled by a capacitive process, which plays a crucial role in the excellent rate performance and superior reversible ability. The high proportion of capacitive behavior can be ascribed to the hierarchically porous structure and improved conductivity resulting from nitrogen and oxygen doping. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations theoretically validate the enhanced potassium storage effect of the as-obtained NOPC. More importantly, the route to NOPC from cyanobacteria in molten salt provides a green approach to the synthesis of porous carbon materials.","2019",NA,"10.1002/chem.201900448","WOS:000469274700018"

We exposed soil microcosms to weekly bursts of Co-60 gamma radiation over six weeks, at three levels of exposure (0.1kGy/hr/wk [low], 1kGy/hr/wk [medium] and 3 kGy/hr/wk [high]). Soil DNA was extracted, and shotgun metagenomes were sequenced and characterised using MG-RAST. We hypothesized that with increasing radiation exposure there would be a decrease in both taxonomic and functional diversity. While bacterial diversity decreased, diversity of fungi and algae unexpectedly increased, perhaps because of release from competition. Despite the decrease in diversity of bacteria and of biota overall, functional gene diversity of algae, bacteria, fungi and total biota increased. Cycles of radiation exposure may increase the range of gene functional strategies viable in soil, a novel ecological example of the effects of stressors or disturbance events promoting some aspects of diversity. Moreover, repeated density-independent population crashes followed by population expansion may allow lottery effects, promoting coexistence. Radiation exposure produced large overall changes in community composition. Our study suggests several potential novel radiation-tolerant groups: in addition to Deinococcus-Thermus, which reached up to 20% relative abundance in the metagenome, the phyla Chloroflexi (bacteria), Chytridiomycota (fungi) and Nanoarcheota (archaea) may be considered as radiation-tolerant.","2019",NA,"10.1038/s41598-019-44441-7","WOS:000469011800042"
"Potapov, AM; Tiunov, AV; Scheu, S","Uncovering trophic positions and food resources of soil animals using bulk natural stable isotope composition","BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS","Despite the major importance of soil biota in nutrient and energy fluxes, interactions in soil food webs are poorly understood. Here we provide an overview of recent advances in uncovering the trophic structure of soil food webs using natural variations in stable isotope ratios. We discuss approaches of application, normalization and interpretation of stable isotope ratios along with methodological pitfalls. Analysis of published data from temperate forest ecosystems is used to outline emerging concepts and perspectives in soil food web research. In contrast to aboveground and aquatic food webs, trophic fractionation at the basal level of detrital food webs is large for carbon and small for nitrogen stable isotopes. Virtually all soil animals are enriched in C-13 as compared to plant litter. This 'detrital shift' likely reflects preferential uptake of C-13-enriched microbial biomass and underlines the importance of microorganisms, in contrast to dead plant material, as a major food resource for the soil animal community. Soil organic matter is enriched in N-15 and C-13 relative to leaf litter. Decomposers inhabiting mineral soil layers therefore might be enriched in N-15 resulting in overlap in isotope ratios between soil-dwelling detritivores and litter-dwelling predators. By contrast, C-13 content varies little between detritivores in upper litter and in mineral soil, suggesting that they rely on similar basal resources, i.e. little decomposed organic matter. Comparing vertical isotope gradients in animals and in basal resources can be a valuable tool to assess trophic interactions and dynamics of organic matter in soil. As indicated by stable isotope composition, direct feeding on living plant material as well as on mycorrhizal fungi is likely rare among soil invertebrates. Plant carbon is taken up predominantly by saprotrophic microorganisms and channelled to higher trophic levels of the soil food web. However, feeding on photoautotrophic microorganisms and non-vascular plants may play an important role in fuelling soil food webs. The trophic niche of most high-rank animal taxa spans at least two trophic levels, implying the use of a wide range of resources. Therefore, to identify trophic species and links in food webs, low-rank taxonomic identification is required. Despite overlap in feeding strategies, stable isotope composition of the high-rank taxonomic groups reflects differences in trophic level and in the use of basal resources. Different taxonomic groups of predators and decomposers are likely linked to different pools of organic matter in soil, suggesting different functional roles and indicating that trophic niches in soil animal communities are phylogenetically structured. During last two decades studies using stable isotope analysis have elucidated the trophic structure of soil communities, clarified basal food resources of the soil food web and revealed links between above- and belowground ecosystem compartments. Extending the use of stable isotope analysis to a wider range of soil-dwelling organisms, including microfauna, and a larger array of ecosystems provides the perspective of a comprehensive understanding of the structure and functioning of soil food webs.","2019",NA,"10.1111/brv.12434","WOS:000456071400003"

In addition, the effect of microwave heating before consumption on the microbial quality of doner kebabs was also investigated. Total mesophilic aerobic bacteria and total psycrophilic aerobic bacteria counts of doner kebabs increased during storage and reached to 6.48, 8.27, 8.15, 3.96 and 5.58, 8.53, 8.63, <1.00 log cfu/g in AP (9th day), MAP (29th day), VP (29th day) and SVP (99th day) groups, respectively.

However, these farming systems are unable to contribute meaningfully to sustainable food security and viable livelihoods. This is because of continuous declines in crop productivity and soil fertility under monocropping systems and shortages of adequate and good quality forage under communal grazing systems. Although the benefits of intercropping have been well documented, there has been low uptake by small-scale farmers in the temperate, frost-prone communal areas of KwaZulu-Natal. This may be attributed to a lack of research applicable to this region as well as to a lack of understanding of how these systems can address the social and technological challenges faced by these farmers. The latest advances in agroecological farming systems are reviewed here to enable small-scale farmers to better assess the benefits relative to ecosystem services that are compatible with their needs. One such service is the provision of food through nutrient cycling. Available nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are the most limiting nutrients in the soils, which are acidic in nature, of this high-rainfall area of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. This results in poor crop productivity and quality, particularly in smallholder, rural farming systems. High costs of chemical fertilizers, which most smallholder farmers cannot afford, and cropping systems involving monoculture, exacerbate the macro-nutrient deficiency, which leads to low crop yields and quality, feed scarcity, plant pests and diseases, resulting in reduced viable livelihoods and household food insecurity. One option to alleviate the situation is by the use of mixed cropping systems in the form of intercropping, the practice of growing two or more crop species at the same time and in the same place. This review explores, elucidates and summarizes the capability of intercropping to augment agroecosystem services essential for sustainability of smallholder, rural farming systems. The review highlights ways in which intercropping can address the socio-economic needs and aspirations of communities and conserve resources for the benefit of the local environment. Niche differentiation (facilitation and complementarity of resources); soil fertility; crop genetic diversity; management of pests, diseases and weeds; crop production; environmental sustainability and economic viability are discussed, as are the mechanisms underlying provisioning of ecosystem services. We have highlighted that intercropping farming systems considerably improve soil fertility, resource-use efficiency, carbon sequestration, phosphorus uptake and availability, water conservation in soils, crop and fodder productivity and quality and control pests and diseases compared with monoculture farming systems. The other major latest development in mixed-cropping systems is that crop genetic diversity resulting from intercropping contributes in various ways towards reducing incidences of pests and diseases. Technologies and mechanisms that have potential to enhance key ecosystem services for promoting sustainable food systems of rural farmers in KwaZulu-Natal are highlighted.","2019",NA,"10.1080/15427528.2018.1547806","WOS:000460364100001"

The study examined the effect of different steaming conditions on molds, bacteria, and yeast as well as on the content of main macro- and micro-nutrients of either normal-quality or hygienically compromised hays. Hay samples were subjected to the following eight treatments each: unsteamed hays as control or hays steamed at 50 degrees C for 90 minutes, at 80 degrees C for 10, 20, or 30 minutes, and at 100 degrees C for 5,10, or 20 minutes. To evaluate a possible storage effect of the treated hays, subsamples were stored for 24 hours at room temperature. Data indicated increased bacterial counts, molds, and yeasts in hygienically compromised hay. Steaming did not affect total bacterial counts in this hay, but all steaming conditions were equally effective leading to a strong decline of molds and yeasts to a level comparable to the normal-quality hay. Interestingly, only steaming at 100 degrees C for at least 10 minutes reduced Bacillus spp. significantly. In the normal-quality hay, steaming lowered the already low bacterial counts further but caused leakage of sodium and copper. Hay steamed and left for 24 hours at room temperature retained its microbial and nutrient profiles. Overall, the study showed that steaming represents a useful strategy for reducing mold contamination in hygienically compromised hay, with no differences among steaming conditions. Most importantly, to reduce contamination of Bacillus spp. in hygienically compromised hays, steaming at 100 degrees C for at least 10 minutes is required. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The invasive condition of this species creates an awareness of the effects inflicted upon the indigenous biodiversity of this region, as well as, on the commercially-important benthic community structure.

This perspective aims to show how a model framework, developed originally for plant virus diseases, can be modified for the case of diseases incited by Xylella fastidiosa. In particular, the model framework enables the specification of a simple but quite general invasion criterion defined in terms of key plant, pathogen, and vector parameters and, importantly, their interactions, which determine whether or not an incursion or isolated outbreak of a pathogen will lead to establishment, persistence, and subsequent epidemic development. Hence, this approach is applicable to the wide range of X. fastidiosa-incited diseases that have recently emerged in southern Europe, each with differing host plant, pathogen subspecies, and vector identities. Of particular importance are parameters relating to vector abundance and activity, transmission characteristics, and behavior in relation to preferences for host infection status.

Their complex particle structures are easily denatured during processing and storage, leading to loss in their biofunctionality. Ionic liquids (ILs) as stabilizing excipients have garnered interest in protein-based pharmaceutical research, but their stabilizing capacity for inactivated virus antigens remains unknown. Here, three biocompatible choline-based ILs, including [Cho][H2PO4], [Cho][Cl], and [Cho][SO4], were tested as potential stabilizers for the inactivated foot-and-mouth disease virus (iFMDV), which are extremely unstable virus particles easily dissociating into smaller pentamers named 12S. Based on differential scanning fluorimetry technology for thermal stability analysis, together with high-performance size-exclusion chromatography for quantitative determination of 146S, it was found that [Cho][Cl] and [cho][SO4] can improve the thermo- and long-term storage stability of iFMDV particles, while [Cho][H2PO4] showed a destabilizing effect. Animal experiments indicated that the immunogenicity of iFMDV antigens was not attenuated in all three ILs. By monitoring the microenvironmental pH of the virus particles in different ILs, a relatively lower proton intensity was observed in [Cho][Cl] and [Cho][SO4] than in buffers and [Cho][H2PO4]. Therefore, the stabilizing mechanism was supposed to be mainly due to suppression of protonation of histidine residues in the inter-pentamer interface of virus particles in [Cho][Cl] and [Cho][SO4], which is distinct from the mechanism reported for other proteins with relatively simple structures. The results suggest that the choline-based ILs with appropriate anions are promising stabilizing excipients for iFMDV or other vaccine antigens.","2019",NA,"10.1039/c9ra02722j","WOS:000468639300063"
"Younginger, BS; Friesen, ML","Connecting signals and benefits through partner choice in plant-microbe interactions","FEMS MICROBIOLOGY LETTERS","Stabilizing mechanisms in plant-microbe symbioses are critical to maintaining beneficial functions, with two main classes: host sanctions and partner choice. Sanctions are currently presumed to be more effective and widespread, based on the idea that microbes rapidly evolve cheating while retaining signals matching cooperative strains. However, hosts that effectively discriminate among a pool of compatible symbionts would gain a significant fitness advantage. Using the well-characterized legume-rhizobium symbiosis as a model, we evaluate the evidence for partner choice in the context of the growing field of genomics. Empirical studies that rely upon bacteria varying only in nitrogen-fixation ability ignore host-symbiont signaling and frequently conclude that partner choice is not a robust stabilizing mechanism. Here, we argue that partner choice is an overlooked mechanism of mutualism stability and emphasize that plants need not use the microbial services provided a priori to discriminate among suitable partners. Additionally, we present a model that shows that partner choice signaling increases symbiont and host fitness in the absence of sanctions. Finally, we call for a renewed focus on elucidating the signaling mechanisms that are critical to partner choice while further aiming to understand their evolutionary dynamics in nature.","2019",NA,"10.1093/femsle/fnz217","WOS:000504086700001"

In this review, we discuss the theoretical and experimental evidence supporting a role for host exploitation in the establishment and evolution of mutualistic microbial symbioses, including data from both extant and experimentally evolved symbioses.

Our data indicated archaea often outcompeted bacteria for C-13-urea while both archaea and bacteria could incorporate C-13-acetate. This C-13 label could also be tracked into eukaryotic microbes. The largest number of C-13-labeled eukaryotic OTUs, and the greatest percentage of eukaryotic C-13 signal, were observed in conjunction with both archaeal and bacterial C-13 incorporation, suggesting that most eukaryotic predators do not distinguish between archaeal and bacterial prey.

The sensitivity of mineral-associated OM to changes in temperature is crucial for reliable predictions of the response of soil C turnover to global warming and the associated flux of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the soil to the atmosphere. We studied the temperature sensitivity of C in < 63 mu m fractions rich in mineral-associated organic matter (MOM) and of C in > 63 mu m fractions rich in particulate organic matter (POM). The fractions were isolated by physical separation of two light-textured arable soils where the C4-plant silage maize had replaced C3-crops 25 years ago. Differences in C-13 abundance allowed for calculation of the age of C in the soil-size fractions (old C, C3-C > 25 years; recent C, C4-C < 25 years). We incubated bulk soils ( < 2 mm) and size fractions sequentially at 6, 18, 26 and 34 degrees C (ramping up and down the temperature scale) and calculated the temperature sensitivity of old and recent C from (CO2)-C-12 and (CO2)-C-13 evolution rates. The temperature sensitivity was similar or slightly higher for POM than for MOM. Within the POM fraction, old C3-C was more sensitive to changes in temperature than recent C4-C. For the MOM fraction, the temperature sensitivity was unrelated to the age of C. Quantitative PCR analysis indicated that the proportions of bacteria, archaea and fungi did not change during incubation.

Here green synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles (GION) were applied to stabilize cadmium (Cd) in a contaminated soil. GION not only stabilized soil Cd, but also improved soil properties within one year of incubation. After GION application both the exchangeable and carbonate bound Cd fractions decreased by 14.2-83.5% and 18.3-85.8% respectively, and most of the Cd was translocated to the residual Cd fraction. The application of GION also strongly altered soil bacterial communities. In GION treatments, the abundance of Gemmatimonadetes, Proteobacteria, and Saccharibacteria increased which led to a shift in the dominant bacterial genera from Bacillus to Candidates koribacter. The variation in bacteria confirmed the restoration of the contaminated soil. The most abundant bacterial genus and species found in GION treatments were related to (i) plant derived biomass decomposition; (ii) ammoxidation and denitrification; and (iii) Fe oxidation. GION application may enhance the formation of larger soil aggregates with anaerobic centers and coprecipitation coupled Fe (II) oxidization, ammcaidation and nitrite reduction followed by Fe mineral ripening may be involved in Cd stabilization.

We tested the capacity for deterministic processes to explain the long-term dynamics of phytoplankton community structure in Lake Muggelsee-a shallow and eutrophic lake in Berlin, Germany using a trait-based approach. We developed a null model representing random processes alone by generating a time series of random trait distributions derived from the observed long-term data. We determined the extent to which deterministic processes lead to nonrandom patterns in phytoplankton communities by comparing the resulting null-trait distributions with the observed trait distributions in the long-term data. We found that phytoplankton communities fell along a gradient from random to nonrandom trait distributions, suggesting that deterministic processes alone do not fully describe the community structure. Nonrandom patterns were observed in communities with high species richness and during late spring as well as early winter. But neither species richness nor seasonality explained nonrandom patterns consistently for different metrics and traits given the high relevance of random trait distribution patterns. Thus, deterministic and stochastic processes may be needed to fully explain the structure of phytoplankton communities under changing environmental conditions.","2019",NA,"10.1007/s12080-019-0424-5","WOS:000501070500009"

How such responses empirically relate to the mechanisms that govern species coexistence is, however, poorly understood. Previous results from 1 ake phytoplankton communities suggested that the evenness of organismal traits in multiple dimensions increases with resource limitation, possibly due to resource partitioning at the individual level. Here we experimentally tested the emergence of this pattern by growing two phytoplankton species (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Microcystis aeruginosa) under a gradient of light intensity, in monoculture and jointly. Under low light (resource) conditions, the populations diversified into a wide range of phenotypes, which were evenly distributed in multidimensional trait space (defined by four pigment-related trait dimensions), consistent with the observed field pattern. Our interpretation is that under conditions of light limitation, individual phytoplankton cells alter photosynthetic traits to reduce overlap in light acquisition, acquiring unexploited resources and thereby likely maximising individual success. Our results provide prime experimental evidence that resource limitation increases the evenness of conspecific and heterospecific microbial phenotypes along trait axes, advancing our understanding of trait-based coexistence.","2019",NA,"10.1038/s41396-018-0320-9","WOS:000464960400004"

We used a 5-year (2007-2011) phytoplankton data set and utilized discontinuity analysis to assess resilience attributes of spring and summer blooms based on the cross-scale resilience model. Using the size structure (i.e., cross-scale structure as an indicator of resilience) in the sampled plankton data, we assessed whether spring and summer blooms differ substantially between but not within blooms; that is, whether they comprise alternative community regimes. Our exploratory study supported this expectation and more broadly resilience theory, which posits that ecological systems can manifest in and change between alternative regimes. The dynamics of regimes receives increased attention because rapid environmental change potentially irreversibly alters ecosystems. Model organisms are needed that allow revealing patterns and processes of various aspects of regime dynamics at tractable time scales. Our preliminary findings suggest that phytoplankton can be suitable models for assessing the intricacies of regimes and regime changes.","2019",NA,"10.3389/fevo.2019.00139","WOS:000467414200001"

However, ecological processes are subject to contemporary evolutionary change, and the degree to which predation affects diversity ultimately depends on the interplay between evolution and ecology. Furthermore, ecological interactions that influence species coexistence can be altered by reciprocal coevolution especially in the case of antagonistic interactions such as predation or parasitism. Here we used an experimental evolution approach to test for the role of initial trait variation in the prey population and coevolutionary hisory of the predator in the ecological dynamics of a two-species bacterial community predated by a ciliate. We found that initial trait variation both at the bacterial and ciliate level enhanced species coexistence, and that subsequent trait evolutionary trajectories depended on the initial genetic diversity present in the population. Our findings provide further support to the notion that the ecology-centric view of diversity maintenance must be reinvestigated in light of recent findings in the field of eco-evolutionary dynamics.","2019",NA,"10.1098/rspb.2019.0245","WOS:000468618100004"

However, recent studies have revealed that hybridisation is prevalent in coral-reef fish, highlighting the need to understand the causes of this process. The angelfishes (family Pomacanthidae) have the greatest proportion (similar to 30%) of hybridising species to date, with 26 species reported to hybridise. The aim of this study was to examine ecological factors (rarity of parent species and niche overlap) that promote hybridisation in terrestrial environments and to test these factors in the marine environment by examining hybridising angelfishes at Christmas Island (Indian Ocean). Three species of pygmy angelfish (Centropyge flavissima, C. eibli, and C. vrolikii) and their hybrids were investigated to address three objectives: (1) to determine temporal and spatial patterns in abundance and whether these patterns are linked to environmental factors; (2) to test for overlapping patterns in habitat use; and (3) to test for overlapping patterns in diet. Based on 14 yr of surveys, C. flavissima was abundant (4.53 individuals per 250 m(2) +/- 0.66), whereas C. eibli, C. vrolikii, and all hybrid combinations were consistently rare (average abundance < 0.3 per 250 m(2) +/- 0.03). Parent species and their hybrids were more abundant at 20 m depth compared to 5 m. All species and their hybrids had similar patterns of abundance around Christmas Island, with significantly high abundances evident at the most sheltered sites. Parent species and their hybrids also had similar diets that comprised a mix of green, red, and brown algae. The rarity of parent species, their niche overlap, and the haremic reproductive strategy likely promote hybridisation in angelfishes at Christmas Island. This study provides empirical evidence that hybridisation in reef fishes conforms to terrestrial-based hypothesis, and thus advances our understanding of the processes underlying hybridisation in coral-reef systems.","2019",NA,"10.1007/s00338-019-01816-6","WOS:000510855000005"

Over the past 30 years, human presence has grown exponentially in the Galapagos Islands, which are home to endemic Darwin's finches. Consequently, humans have changed the environment and diet of Darwin's finches, which in turn, could affect their gut microbiota. In this study, we compared the gut microbiota of two species of Darwin's finches, small ground finches (Geospiza fuliginosa) and medium ground finches (Geospiza fortis), across sites with and without human presence, where finches prefer human-processed and natural food, respectively. We predicted that: (a) finch microbiota would differ between sites with and without humans due to differences in diet, and (b) gut microbiota of each finch species would be most similar where finches have the highest niche overlap (areas with humans) compared to the lowest niche overlap (areas without humans). We found that gut bacterial community structure differed across sites and host species. Gut bacterial diversity was most distinct between the two species at the site with human presence compared to the site without human presence, which contradicted our predictions. Within host species, medium ground finches had lower bacterial diversity at the site with human presence compared to the site without human presence and bacterial diversity of small ground finches did not differ between sites. Our results show that the gut microbiota of Darwin's finches is affected differently across sites with varying human presence.","2019",NA,"10.1111/mec.15088","WOS:000471073000021"

However, we lack a comprehensive view of the likelihood of feedback-driven coexistence, partly because of a failure to analyse pairwise PSF, the metric directly linked to plant species coexistence. Here, we determine the relative importance of plant evolutionary history, traits, and environmental factors for coexistence through PSF using a meta-analysis of 1038 pairwise PSF measures. Consistent with eco-evolutionary predictions, feedback is more likely to mediate coexistence for pairs of plant species (1) associating with similar guilds of mycorrhizal fungi, (2) of increasing phylogenetic distance, and (3) interacting with native microbes. We also found evidence for a primary role of pathogens in feedback-mediated coexistence.

Besides taxonomic diversity, the functional diversity approach is considered highly predictive of the structure of biological communities and ecosystem processes. Temporary aquatic ecosystems have a great evolutionary and ecological importance, as they are very endemic places with rare species, often endangered by local extinction. The objective of this study was to describe the structure of the zooplankton community of eight Brazilian temporary ponds during the flood period. The organism collections and measures of environmental variables were carried out from 01/31 to 02/02/2017. As they are small and ephemeral environments, with very peculiar characteristics, both the taxonomic diversity (27 taxa) and the functional one were relatively low, suggesting convergence of the functional characteristics of the species. The zooplankton community was divided into five functional groups and the most significant functional attributes in the grouping of the species were habitat, trophic group and food habit. The functional groups were similar to the taxonomic groupings, except for raptorial carnivorous (Copepoda Cyclopoida and one Rotifera) that comprised the same functional group. In terms of biomass, two species of the Anostraca of the genus Dendrocephalus far exceeded the other groups. It was shown that the presence of these large Branchiopoda has an impact on the composition and numerical density of the zooplankton community, particularly the Cladocera, possibly due to niche overlap.","2019",NA,"10.23818/limn.38.17","WOS:000457181700013"

We isolated 43 fungal strains that naturally colonize seeds of an invasive winter annual (Brassica tournefortii) in the Sonoran Desert, and evaluated the impact of 18 of them on seed germination and mortality of B. tournefortii and a co-occurring native annual (Plantago ovata) under simulated summer and winter temperatures. Fungi isolated from B. tournefortii seeds impacted germination and mortality of seeds of both plant species in vitro. Seed responses reflected host-specific effects by fungi, the degree of which differed significantly between the strains, and depended on the temperature. In the winter temperature, ten fungal strains increased or reduced seed germination, but substantial seed mortality due to fungi was not observed. Two strains increased germination of P. ovata more strongly than B. tournefortii. In the summer temperature, fungi induced both substantial seed germination and mortality, with ten strains demonstrating host-specificity. Under natural conditions, host-specific effects of fungi on seed germination may further differentiate plant species niche in germination response, with a potential of promoting coexistence. Both host-specific and non-host-specific effects of fungi on seed loss may induce polarizing effects on plant coexistence depending on the ecological context. The coexistence theory provides a clear framework to interpret these polarizing effects. Moreover, fungi pathogenic to both plant species could induce host-specific germination, which challenges the theoretical assumption of density-independent germination response. These implications from an in vitro study underscore the need to weave theoretical modeling, reductive empirical experiments, and natural observations to illuminate effects of soil-borne fungi on coexistence of annual plant species in variable desert environments.","2019",NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0224417","WOS:000532670600035"

The co-culture of DMF-hydrolyzing bacteria and methanogens in the CCS allowed for both hydrolysis of DMF and methane production to proceed successfully under the anaerobic condition, realizing the complete conversion from DMF to methane. However, a niche overlap due to the competition for the intermediates lowered the abundance of DMF-hydrolyzing bacteria.

"Xie, L; Yuan, AE; Shou, WY","Simulations reveal challenges to artificial community selection and possible strategies for success","PLOS BIOLOGY","Multispecies microbial communities often display community functions arising from interactions of member species. Interactions are often difficult to decipher, making it challenging to design communities with desired functions. Alternatively, similar to artificial selection for individuals in agriculture and industry, one could repeatedly choose communities with the highest community functions to reproduce by randomly partitioning each into multiple Newborn communities for the next cycle. However, previous efforts in selecting complex communities have generated mixed outcomes that are difficult to interpret. To understand how to effectively enact community selection, we simulated community selection to improve a community function that requires 2 species and imposes a fitness cost on one or both species. Our simulations predict that improvement could be easily stalled unless various aspects of selection were carefully considered. These aspects include promoting species coexistence, suppressing noncontributors, choosing additional communities besides the highest functioning ones to reproduce, and reducing stochastic fluctuations in the biomass of each member species in Newborn communities. These considerations can be addressed experimentally. When executed effectively, community selection is predicted to improve costly community function, and may even force species to evolve slow growth to achieve species coexistence. Our conclusions hold under various alternative model assumptions and are therefore applicable to a variety of communities.","2019",NA,"10.1371/journal.pbio.3000295","WOS:000473675900020"

For these two estuarine predators, our results indicated that although dietary niche overlap was broad, different feeding modes (spatial and behavioral) allow niche partitioning. The diet of red drum was dominated by pink shrimp Farfantepenaeus duorarum and other demersal species. For snook, although their diet included significant numbers of pink shrimp, it was largely dominated by pelagic and epibenthic fishes. Mean red drum C-?13 signatures (-10.5 to -20.8 parts per thousand) differed significantly between areas and were strongly correlated with both area-specific seagrass concentration and amount of incidental seagrass ingestion. Mean snook C-13 signatures were generally depleted (-20.9 to -22.4 parts per thousand) with the exception of one area (-14.1 parts per thousand).

Further, numerous closely related SJ3 populations harbor differentiated metabolisms that may function to minimize niche overlap, further increasing endemic diversity.

Here, we examined how a history of long-term co-existence, and thus potential for local co-adaptation, influenced the process of plant community assembly. Soil inocula and seeds of eight plant species were collected from three calcareous grasslands with a long history of grazing within a single geographical region. Mesocosm communities were established using local genotypes from a single site or an artificial mixture of genotypes from two different sites. To investigate the role of root exudates and local ('home') and non-local ('away') soil biota as mediators of plant species co-existence, the population origin treatment was combined with the addition of activated carbon, which is known to adsorb exudates from soil, and sterilization of soil inocula. Individual-, species- and mesocosm-level responses were measured over the course of three growing seasons. We found that root exudates promoted seedling survival, species co-existence and productivity in assemblages of genotypes originating from the same community but had a weak impact in mixed, novel communities. Soil biota promoted the growth of subordinate forbs and restrained the growth of dominant graminoids, particularly in communities composed of local genotypes. The effects of population origin were significant in the first 2 years of the experiment but were not detectable in the third year when interbreeding and new seedling establishment took place. Plant genotypes coupled with 'home' microbial inoculum experienced a stronger reduction in growth compared with genotypes exposed to 'away' inoculum, indicating that plants experienced home-field disadvantage in interactions with soil biota.

In a shadehouse experiment in Panama, we found that seedlings of the native tree species, Virola surinamensis (Myristicaceae), had reduced performance in the soil microbial community of their maternal tree compared with in the soil microbial community of a nonmaternal tree from the same population. Performance differences were unrelated to soil nutrients or to colonization by my-corrhizal fungi, suggesting that highly specialized pathogens were the mechanism reducing seedling performance in maternal soils. We then constructed a simulation model to explore the ecological and evolutionary consequences of genotype-specific pathogens in multispecies plant communities. Model results indicated that genotype-specific pathogens promote plant species coexistence-albeit less strongly than species-specific pathogens-and are most effective at maintaining species richness when genetic diversity is relatively low. Simulations also revealed that genotype-specific pathogens select for increased seed dispersal relative to species-specific pathogens, potentially helping to create seed dispersal landscapes that allow pathogens to more effectively promote diversity.

In a semiarid grassland, the frequency and magnitude of change in plant species composition through time varied from relatively static to highly dynamic among patches across the landscape. We field tested whether these alternative successional trajectories correlated with alternative plant-soil interactions. In temporally stable patches, we found negative plant-soil feedbacks, where plants grew worse with conspecific than heterospecific soil biota-a mechanism that maintains stability in mathematical models. In contrast, feedbacks in temporally dynamic patches were neutral to positive. Importantly, the magnitude of feedbacks depended on plant frequency, enabling plant species to increase in cover when rare, which theory predicts will promote long-term, stable coexistence.

As a specific form of mutualism, cross-feeding, where each of two mutualists produces a resource the other one needs, has been broadly studied. However, few theoretical studies have examined competition between cross-feeding mutualists and cheaters, who do not synthesize resources themselves. In this paper we study a model with two mutualists, a cheater, two micronutrients that are synthesized and exchanged by the mutualists, and one macronutrient that is only from external supply. We investigate the coexistence of the species in the framework of resource competition theory. In particular, we examine the effect of the mutualists' synthesis rates on their coexistence. In the absence of cheaters, multiple stable states occur if the synthesis rates are high, and higher synthesis rates increase the possibility that mutualists coexist. However, when the cheater is present, higher synthesis rates promote invasion by the cheater: If the cheater is superior on all three resources, it will either persist with at most one mutualist or even trigger extinction of all three species; if the cheater is only superior on the macronutrient, both mutualists may still coexist with the cheater.

Four hypotheses were tested using carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope values as a proxy for foraging behavior: 1) species exhibit ontogenetic shifts in habitat and thus display a shift in C-13 with differential use of the continental shelf; 2) species exhibit ontogenetic prey shifts (i.e. from smaller to larger prey items) and become enriched in N-15; 3) individuals acquire energy from spatially confined local resource pools and exhibit limited displacement; and 4) species exhibit similarly sized and highly overlapping trophic niches. We found some evidence for ontogenetic shifts in habitat-use (delta C-13) for thorny and little skate and diet (delta N-15) of thorny and winter skate and hypothesize that individuals exhibit gradual trophic niche transition, especially in delta N-15 space, rather than a clear and distinct shift in diet throughout ontogeny. Spatial isoscapes generated for little, thorny, and winter skate highlighted distinct spatial patterns in isotopic composition across the coastal shelf. For little and thorny skate, patterns mimicked expected spatial variability in the isotopic composition of phytoplankton/POM, suggesting limited displacement and utilization of spatially confined resource pools. Winter skate, however, exhibited a much narrower range of delta C-13 and delta N-15 values, suggesting individuals may use resources from a more confined latitudinal range. Although high total trophic niche overlap was observed between some species (e.g. little and thorny skate), sympatric species (e.g. little and winter skate) exhibited a degree of trophic niche separation. These findings offer new insight into the trophic dynamics of a poorly-studied, vulnerable group of predators, and highlight a need to re-examine assumptions pertaining to aspects of their ecology.","2019",NA,"10.1111/ecog.03990","WOS:000466819000017"

The aim of the present study is to make a first characterization of crustaceans in a small shallow coastal lake, using null models, specifically with regard to species co-occurrence and niche overlap. The results revealed that the species associations we found are random, which is due to many species that occur in most or all of the water bodies examined, whereas niche sharing revealed that there is niche segregation due to the absence of competition among the species reported. These results would be in agreement with observations for mountain lakes and lagoons in northern Patagonia, both in Argentina and in Chile, and partially similar to what has been found in Andean shallow wetlands in northern Chile. More and more detailed studies will be necessary for understanding the population and community dynamics in these water bodies.","2019",NA,"10.1163/15685403-00003830","WOS:000457981400002"

Here, we argue that macro-evolutionary niche conservatism and unequal diversification rates among phylum-level lineages are strong determinants of diversit-yenvironment relationships in bacterial systems. That is, apart from stochasticity, environmental effects operate most strongly on phylum composition, which in turn dictates the species diversity of bacterial communities. This concept is demonstrated using bacterioplankton in the surface seawaters of the East China Sea. Furthermore, we show that the species richness of a local bacterioplankton community can generally be estimated based on the relative abundances of phyla and their contributions of species numbers in the global seawater pool-highlighting the important influence of evolutionary constraints on local community diversity.","2019",NA,"10.1038/s41396-018-0336-1","WOS:000461719600014"

In this study, we aimed to verify how the cover and richness of corticolous lichens on Araucaria angustifolia trunks vary between two different habitats (Forest and Grassland). The photoquadrat sampling method was applied to A. angustifolia trunks. The Coral Point Count software with Excel extensions (CPCe) was used to analyze photographs for lichen cover and richness. Additionally, a redundancy analysis was conducted to estimate how five abiotic and two biotic variables affected the spatial distribution of lichens. Twenty-five morphospecies were identified, none of them occurring exclusively in the Grassland habitat. Canopy openness, air humidity and tree trunk rugosity were important parameters influencing lichen distribution; therefore, spatial segregation of growth forms can be explained by environmental selectivity. Foliose lichens require more air humidity, which explains their predominance in the Forest habitat. Canopy openness in Grassland habitat favors fruticose lichens, which depend on factors such as wind for reproduction.","2019",NA,"10.1590/0102-33062018abb0095","WOS:000460755500002"

We performed a fully reciprocal greenhouse experiment where seedlings of two co-occurring Asclepias spp. (milkweed) were grown either with their own or the other species' microbial communities under high or low watering treatments. We found that seedlings of each species were smaller when exposed to conspecific relative to heterospecific soil biota, perhaps due to a build-up of specific soil pathogens. Importantly, this negative feedback diminished under reduced water-availability, and also in the absence of live soil organisms.

Trophic niche overlap was high (> 70%), similar to percentages in other ocean basins. BET occupied a higher trophic position than YFT and fed on deeper prey (high delta N-15 values and high proportions of monounsaturated fatty acids). The trophic position of YFT decreased slightly in the last 15 years (delta N-15 values decreased by similar to 0.5 parts per thousand), suggesting a change in epipelagic communities, as observed in the eastern Pacific Ocean.

The long-term effects of high- and low-strength influent ammonium (NH4+-N) on the anammox activity, ecological niche characteristics and active microbial community were investigated in a one-stage partial nitritation/anammox (PN/A) process. The total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency was up to 90% with influent NH4+-N of 192 mg/L. The N-15-isotope pairing technique illustrated that the potential anammox rate could reach to 3507.8 nmoL/g-sludge/h, accounting for 73.2% of dinitrogen production. As the influent NH4+-N decreased to 63 mg/L, the anammox population significantly decreased and the Nitrospira became the dominant specialized species in the PN/A system. The Nitrobacter had the smallest niche overlap value and the furthest ecological distance to the anammox bacteria among the seven investigated nitrogen conversion-related genes along the influent NH4+-N concentration gradient, indicating different ecological similarities. The redundancy analysis showed that the rise of dissolved oxygen caused by low NH4+-N might be the main cause of the excessive proliferation of the Nitrospira.

However, to date, most of the studies on the ecological consequences of antagonistic interactions between invasive plants and the resident biota focused only on pairwise interactions. A full understanding of invasion dynamics requires studies that test the effects of multiple antagonists on fitness of invasive plants and co-occurring native plants. Here, we used an invasive plant Mikania micrantha, a co-occurring native plant Coix lacryma-jobi, and a native holoparasitic plant Cuscuta campestris to test whether parasitism on M. micrantha interacts with soil fungi and bacteria to reduce fitness of the invader and promote growth of the co-occurring native plant. In a factorial setup, M. micrantha and C. lacryma-jobi were grown together in pots in the presence versus absence of parasitism on M. micrantha by C. campestris and in the presence versus absence of full complements of soil bacteria and fungi. Fungicide and bactericide were used to suppress soil fungi and bacteria, respectively. Findings show that heavy parasitism by C. campestris caused the greatest reduction in M. micrantha biomass when soil fungi and bacteria were suppressed. In contrast, the co-occurring native plant C. lacryma-jobi experienced the greatest increase in biomass when grown with heavily parasitized M. micrantha and in the presence of a full complement of soil fungi and bacteria. Taken together, our results suggest that selective parasitism on susceptible invasive plants by native parasitic plants and soil microorganisms may diminish competitive ability of invasive plants and facilitate native plant coexistence with invasive plants.","2019","JUL 2019","10.1002/ece3.5407","WOS:000474182700001"

We find a signal for temporal change in AMF community similarity that is 40-fold stronger than seen in the most recent studies, likely due to weekly samplings of roots, rhizosphere and soil throughout the 17 weeks from seedling to fruit maturity and the use of the fungal DNA barcode to recognize species in a simple, agricultural environment.

Here, we characterized the gut microbiota of the Amphilophus species complex from Central America (known as the Midas cichlid complex), encompassing 158 wild specimens (13 species) collected from seven Nicaraguan lakes, and combined these data with previously published data from two African lakes (spanning 29 species). Our aim was to comprehensively explore trends in microbiota variation and persistence along the large spatial and temporal scales of cichlid diversification (from the oldest radiation in L. Tanganyika, 9-12 My old, to young ones in Nicaraguan crater lakes, <0.5 My old), in allopatry and sympatry (within and across lakes), and across the range of dietary niches (from highly specialized to generalist feeders). Despite their extraordinary diversity, cichlids shared a remarkably conserved microbial taxonomic profile, which argues for a primary role of the host genetics in the assembly and maintenance of these microbial communities. Within this partly constrained microbiota profile, geographic isolation (continent and lake) represented the first level of discrimination. For the Midas cichlid, a partial congruency was found between host microbiota and genetic distances, suggesting that microbial communities have partly diversified along their cichlid phylogeographic history of crater lake colonization. In sympatry (within lakes), the young and poorly ecologically diversified cichlid assemblages of Central American lakes display largely unresolved gut microbiotas (in terms of both alpha and beta diversities), whereas the phylogenetically and ecologically diverse species found in African lakes showed greater microbial interspecific diversity. This pattern largely points to the level of habitat segregation, trophic niche overlap, and reproductive barriers as major modulators of the gut microbiota connectivity among sympatric species.","2019",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2019.02372","WOS:000497491600001"

To illustrate the approach, we explore two case studies: an experimental freshwater algal community and a long-term time series of displacement in an intertidal community.

Based on these papers the EcM richness and its association with Nothofagaceae species was analyzed. Represented by 45 genera (34 Basidiomycetes and 11 Ascomycetes), 479 EcM taxa have been recorded, plus an additional 46 EcM taxa which are potentially EcM. Cortinarius was the most frequent and diverse genus, with 64.9% of total species. Nothofagus dombeyi had the highest number of unique EcM species, followed by N. pumilio, N. antarctica and Lophozonia obliqua. The EcM community associated with Nothofagus species, except N. nitida, showed higher similarities among themselves, than with Lophozonia and Fuscospora species. Beta diversity indexes showed EcM Nothofagus species have 29-42% niche overlap, while Nothofagus-Lophozonia only had 1-16%. The assessment of the accuracy of the EcM diversity, host specificity and community structure deserve further studies combining phylogenetic analysis based on broad ecological surveys.

The soil conditions were assessed by measuring the soil moisture and nutrients of the topsoil, and interspecific relationship and population niche were utilized to analyze the plant community structure variances among different restoration measures. Results showed that the soil and vegetation in the sand barriers measures were better than that in the CK. The soil moisture in the sandbag measure was 16.67% higher than that in the wicker measure. The nutrients content and microbial biomass were also the best in the sandbag measures.

The presence of temporal or spatial variability significantly affects the competition dynamics in populations, and gives rise to some counterintuitive observations. In this paper, we consider both birth-death (BD) or death-birth (DB) Moran processes, which are set up on a circular or a complete graph. We investigate spatial and temporal variability affecting division and/or death parameters. Assuming that mutant and wild-type fitness parameters are drawn from an identical distribution, we study mutant fixation probability and timing. We demonstrate that temporal and spatial types of variability possess fundamentally different properties. Under temporal randomness, in a completely mixed system, minority mutants experience (i) higher than neutral fixation probability and a higher mean conditional fixation time, if the division rates are affected by randomness and (ii) lower fixation probability and lower mean conditional fixation time if the death rates are affected. Once spatial restrictions are imposed, however, these effects completely disappear, and mutants in a circular graph experience neutral dynamics, but only for the DB update rule in case (i) and for the BD rule in case (ii) above. In contrast to this, in the case of spatially variable environment, both for BD/DB processes, both for complete/circular graph and both for division/death rates affected, minority mutants experience a higher than neutral probability of fixation. Fixation time, however, is increased by randomness on a circle, while it decreases for complete graphs under random division rates. A basic difference between temporal and spatial kinds of variability is the types of correlations that occur in the system. Under temporal randomness, mutants are spatially correlated with each other (they simply have equal fitness values at a given moment of time; the same holds for wild-types). Under spatial randomness, there are subtler, temporal correlations among mutant and wild-type cells, which manifest themselves by cells of each type 'claiming' better spots for themselves.

Understanding how food resources are used and whether the diets of neighboring species are different are particularly important when considering the coexistence and functional role of species. Territorial damselfish on coral reefs are considered to be herbivores that defend algal mats from other food competitors. However, this guild contains numerous small species whose functional role and dietary diversification is poorly understood. Here, the relationships between diet and spatial distribution of seven intermediate-sized territorial damselfishes at Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea (5 degrees 30S, 150 degrees 05E) were investigated. These species partition habitat across three reef zones with distinct patterns of fine-scale distribution. It was predicted that neighboring species partition food resources with minimal dietary overlap. Examination of isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen delineated three distinct feeding strategies: pelagic, reef-based, and an intermediate group feeding on both prey types. None of the species appear to be strict herbivores. Adjacent species exhibited high-intermediate trophic niche partitioning when examining pelagic versus reef-based production sources, with two species previously described as benthic herbivores exhibiting pelagic feeding. The study demonstrates that diet reinforces the patterns of spatial partitioning and coexistence among ecologically similar damselfishes. These findings add to a growing view that interspecific differences among similar species are lost when categorizing species into broad functional classifications, and that previous studies suggesting that territorial damselfish are strictly reef-based feeders may not be applicable in all systems or for all species.","2019",NA,"10.1007/s00227-018-3463-3","WOS:000455343900001"

Fungicides increased germination of Toona ciliata seeds and decreased mortality of Syzygium rubicundum and Olea dioica seedlings. The fungus-induced mortality of one of these species, S. rubicundum, decreased with decreasing fragment size, indicating that its interactions with pathogenic fungi may weaken as fragments become smaller. We provide evidence that a potential diversity-maintaining plant-fungus interaction weakens in small forest fragments and suggest that such disruptions may have important long-term consequences for plant diversity.

Within this transition environment, we investigated the coexistence of two brachyuran species with different habitat preferences, i.e. marine and freshwater by quantifying niche overlap. The aim was to determine whether shifting environmental pressures or variability within the stromatolite pools (i.e. regular state shifts between marine and freshwater conditions) would invoke a dietary response or competitive interaction between these two species that are usually separated by their habitat tolerances. It was hypothesised that there would be little overlap between the two species but that this overlap would be greater in winter compared to summer due to reduced ectothermic activity. Stable isotope niche analysis revealed no dietary overlap between the two species at any site or in either season (summer or winter). Furthermore, isotope signatures suggest that both species feed on resources from their respective microhabitats. Despite the usual tendency of ecotone or edge populations to adopt a generalist diet, both species were able to remain habitat specialists, likely due to their highly mobile nature and access to suitable microhabitats within this dynamic freshwater/marine ecotone. This study is important from an environmental change perspective as it supports the hypothesis that populations occupying transitional environments such as these might be more tolerant of habitat shifts than their counterparts dwelling in more stable localities, and thus these populations are more likely to coexist.","2019",NA,"10.1007/s12237-019-00554-w","WOS:000465958500017"

On the contrary, the evolution of NFDS interactions between distantly related species has received less attention. Here, we tracked the co-evolution of Escherichia coli and Citrobacter freundii that initially differ in their ecological characteristics. We showed that these two bacterial species engaged in an NFDS interaction particularly resilient to further evolution: despite a very strong asymmetric rate of adaptation, their coexistence was maintained owing to an NFDS pattern where fitness increases steeply as the frequency decreases towards zero. Using a model, we showed how and why such NFDS pattern can emerge.

Without manipulative experiments, assessing the role of foraging ecology and interspecific competition in structuring diet is challenging. Systems with regular pulses of resources act as a natural experiment to investigate the factors that influence the dietary niches of consumers. We used natural pulses of mast-fruiting of American beech (Fagus grandifolia) to test whether optimal foraging or competition structure the dietary niche breadth and overlap between two congener rodent species (Peromyscus leucopus and P. maniculatus), both of which are generalist consumers. We reconstructed diets seasonally over a 2-year period using stable isotope analysis (delta C-13, delta N-15) of hair and of potential dietary items and measured niche dynamics using standard ellipse area calculated within a Bayesian framework. Changes in niche breadth were generally consistent with predictions of optimal foraging theory, with both species consuming more beechnuts (a high-quality food resource) and having a narrower niche breadth during masting seasons compared to nonmasting seasons when dietary niches expanded and more fungi (a low-quality food source) were consumed. In contrast, changes in dietary niche overlap were consistent with competition theory, with higher diet overlap during masting seasons than during nonmasting seasons. Overall, dietary niche dynamics were closely tied to beech masting, underscoring that food availability influences competition. Diet plasticity and niche partitioning between the two Peromyscus species may reflect differences in foraging strategies, thereby reducing competition when food availability is low. Such dietary shifts may have important implications for changes in ecosystem function, including the dispersal of fungal spores.","2019","AUG 2019","10.1002/ece3.5587","WOS:000481913800001"
"Derbridge, JJ; Koprowski, JL","Experimental removals reveal dietary niche partitioning facilitates coexistence between native and introduced species","ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","Niche overlap between native species and ecologically similar invaders can lead to competitive exclusion of threatened native species, but if two such species also co-occur naturally elsewhere, interactions between native and introduced populations may mirror coevolved niche partitioning that reduces competition and promotes coexistence. A single, insular population of Fremont's squirrel (Tamiasciurus fremonti) the Mount Graham red squirrel (MGRS; T. f. grahamensis) in the Pinaleno Mountains, Arizona, USA, is critically endangered and resource competition with introduced Abert's squirrels (Sciurus aberti) may threaten its long-term persistence. The species are naturally synoptic in other mountain sites, and both consume diets comprised primarily of conifer seeds and fungi. We conducted experimental removals of introduced Abert's squirrels and used stable isotope analysis of diets before and after removals, and of diets in naturally syntopic populations to test the hypothesis that dietary niche partitioning can facilitate coexistence between native and introduced species. We also developed a novel approach to determine the influence of fluctuating food availability on carbon enrichment in consumers. Mount Graham red squirrels and introduced Abert's squirrels partitioned the dietary niche similarly to naturally syntopic populations. Removals had no apparent effect. Diet of MGRS was more closely linked to availability of resources than to presence of Abert's squirrels. Flexible dietary niche of introduced Abert's squirrels may have allowed them to exploit a resource opportunity in syntopy with MGRS. Variable food production of MGRS habitat may intensify competition in poor years, and territorial defense against non-native Abert's squirrels likely imposes fitness costs on individual MGRS. Similarity in our model species' diets may make MGRS more vulnerable to competition if climate change eliminates the advantages of larder-hoarding. Where introduced populations of ecologically similar species are better adapted to changing conditions, they may ultimately replace southern peripheral populations of native species.","2019",NA,"10.1002/ece3.5036","WOS:000465089500032"

However, the distribution of bacterial communities and factors driving coexistence in tree-grass associations and their ecosystem functions remain poorly understood. In this study, the distribution of soil bacteria and their link to changes in abiotic factors were investigated in adjacent montane grassland (C-4 plants) and pine forest (bunya pine and hoop pine; C-3 plants) sites in the Bunya Mountains, subtropical Australia. Different vegetation (grassy balds and forest) had a substantial effect on terrestrial ecosystem properties, with higher levels of soil nutrients (e.g. total nitrogen (N), total phosphorus (P)) and electrical conductivity (EC), and lower delta C-13 values and pH under forests compared with grassland. Bacterial alpha-diversity (total species per operational taxonomic unit richness) did not differ between grassland and pine forest sites, whereas strong shifts in the bacterial community composition and structure were evident. Patterns in bacterial community structure were strongly associated with changes in soil pH, EC, total P and delta C-13. Different bacterial groups associated with pine forest (Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria) and grassland (Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia) were identified as key groups contributing to the segregation of these two ecosystems in the Bunya Mountains. These findings suggest that heterogeneity in soil edaphic properties (e.g. key nutrients) likely contributed to variation in bacterial beta-diversity of grassland and pine forest, which has potential implications for species coexistence and ecosystem function in montane eastern Australia.","2019",NA,"10.1071/SR19111","WOS:000501807900003"

We use a landscape genomics approach at sites sampled throughout the range of this system in Kenya to investigate the demographics and genetic structure of the different partners in the association. We find that different species of ant associates of V. drepanolobium show striking differences in their spatial distribution throughout Kenya, and these differences are only partly correlated with abiotic factors. A comparison of the population structure of the host plant and its three obligately arboreal ant symbionts, Crematogaster mimosae, Crematogaster nigriceps, and Tetraponera penzigi, shows that the ants exhibit somewhat similar patterns of structure throughout each of their respective ranges, but that this does not correlate in any clear way with the respective genetic structure of the populations of their host plants. A lack of evidence for local coadaptation in this system suggests that all partners have evolved to cope with a wide variety of biotic and abiotic conditions.","2019",NA,"10.3389/fevo.2019.00206","WOS:000470796900001"

This work evaluates the differences in the trophic characteristics of two congeneric species, Astyanax taeniatus (Jenyns, 1842) and Astyanax lacustris (Lutken, 1875), in Rio das Velhas Basin, which is highly impacted by the discharge of sewage from the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte (MRBH). Eight sites were sampled and grouped into three regions: upper course (two sites upstream of the MRBH); middle course (three sites located in the middle portion of the Rio das Velhas, region with greater influence of the MRBH), and lower course (three sites downstream of the MRBH). Samples of fish and food resources were collected from all sites to obtain the isotopic composition of nitrogen (delta N-15) and carbon (delta C-13), and the stomach contents of the two species was analized. The most common items in the stomach of A. lacustris and A. taeniatus, respectively, were from plants and insects, followed by algae/periphyton (especially at the low course of Rio das Velhas). In contrast, stable isotope analyses indicated that algae (in polluted sites) and periphyton (in least-disturbed sites) were best assimilated both species. Both analyses indicated that the trophic niches of the two species overlap more in more polluted sites relative to less polluted sites. Astyanax taeniatus and A. lacustris only presented different isotopic composition of carbon and nitrogen in the upper course of the Rio das Velhas, probably in response to the greater diversity of food items consumed by each species. In the other regions, the species presented similar isotopic signatures, with delta N-15 and delta C-13 notably enriched in the most polluted regions (middle and low course). Our results suggest that pollution acts by increasing trophic niche overlap of these species, altering the type of resources most assimilated, and promoting a greater enrichment of delta N-15 in fish and resources.","2019",NA,"10.3897/zoologia.36.e30445","WOS:000478062800001"

Methods and Results We selected a wheat field characterized by a diversified topography, to be responsible for variations in productivity and in canopy-driven microclimate. Fusarium and Alternaria mycotoxins where quantified in wheat ears at three sampling dates between flowering and harvest at 40 points. Tenuazonic acid (TeA), alternariol (AOH), alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), tentoxin (TEN), deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEN) and deoxynivalenol-3-Glucoside (DON.3G) were quantified. In canopy temperature, air and soil humidity were recorded for each point with data-loggers. Fusarium spp. as trichothecene producers, Alternaria spp. and fungal abundances were assessed using qPCR. Pseudomonas fluorescens bacteria were quantified with a culture based method. We only found DON, DON.3G, TeA and TEN to be ubiquitous across the whole field, while AME, AOH and ZEN were only occasionally detected. Fusarium was more abundant in spots with high soil humidity, while Alternaria in warmer and drier spots. Mycotoxins correlated differently to the observed explanatory variables: positive correlations between DON accumulation, tri 5 gene and Fusarium abundance were clearly detected. The correlations among the others observed variables, such as microclimatic conditions, varied among the sampling dates. The results of statistical model identification do not exclude that species coexistence could influence mycotoxin production. Conclusions Fusarium and Alternaria mycotoxins accumulation varies heavily across the field and the sampling dates, providing the realism of landscape-scale studies. Mycotoxin concentrations appear to be partially explained by biotic and abiotic variables.

Recent studies suggest that soil microbial communities may mediate the impacts of resource availability on plant performance, yet little is known about the net effect of conspecific soil microorganisms for tree seedling light responses. Here we examined the interactive effects of light availability and presence of conspecific soil microorganisms on tree seedling growth, morphology and nutrient content for two congeneric tropical tree species. The two Bauhinia tree species with contrasting shade tolerance were grown in sterilized or unsterilized soil medium, under either high (50%) or low (10%) light conditions in a greenhouse experiment. Plant light responses and soil feedback effects were determined after 12 weeks. Results showed that the light-demanding tree species was generally more responsive to both light and soil microbes compared with its shade-tolerant congener. Presence of soil microbes enhanced plant growth and biomass responses to increased light availability for the light-demanding species alone, driven by positive soil feedback effects in high light. Six plant traits (leaf mass fraction, stem mass fraction, specific stem length, leaf phosphorus concentration, leaf nitrogen: phosphorus ratio and root nitrogen: phosphorus ratio) showed significant interactive effects between light and soil treatment. Observed changes to leaf biomass allocation in response to light in the presence of conspecific soil microorganisms were consistent with optimality theory and adjustments to maximize resource acquisition under different light conditions. In addition, presence of soil microbes decreased the average plasticity of plant nutrient content and stoichiometry in response to light for the light-demanding Bauhinia species. Together these results highlight the importance of conspecific soil microbes for plant-light relations, with implications for plant-plant interactions and species coexistence.","2019",NA,"10.1016/j.envexpbot.2019.103826","WOS:000482246100024"

The outcome of plant facilitative interactions can be indirectly affected by mycorrhizal symbiosis, ultimately shaping biodiversity patterns. We tested whether mycorrhizal symbiosis enhances plant facilitative interactions and whether its effect is consistent across different methodological approaches and biological scenarios. We conducted a meta-analysis of 215 cases (involving 21 nurse and 29 facilitated species), in which the performance of a facilitated plant species is measured in the presence or absence of mycorrhizal fungi. We show that mycorrhizal fungi significantly enhance plant facilitative interactions mainly through an increment in plant biomass (aboveground) and nutrient content, although their effects differ across biological contexts. In semiarid environments mycorrhizal symbiosis enhances plant facilitation, while its effect is non-significant in temperate ecosystems. In addition, arbuscular but not ecto-mycorrhizal (EMF) fungi significantly enhance plant facilitation, particularly increasing the P content of the plants more than EMF. Some knowledge gaps regarding the importance of this phenomenon have been detected in this meta-analysis. The effect of mycorrhizal symbiosis on plant facilitation has rarely been assessed in other ecosystems different from semiarid and temperate forests, and rarely considering other fungal benefits provided to plants besides nutrients. Finally, we are still far from understanding the effects of the whole fungal community on plant-plant interactions, and on plant species coexistence.","2019",NA,"10.1111/ecog.03926","WOS:000460078900005"

Although nitrogen-fixing plants play a crucial role in maintaining high ecosystem productivity, their effects on forest diversity are greatly debated. Legumes can reduce local diversity because of the fertilization effect; however, they can also facilitate species coexistence through complementary resource utilization. 2. In natural forests, nitrogen requirements and biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) vary widely among legumes. We used leaf nitrogen isotopic composition to differentiate the level of BNF activity among seven legumes across a steep gradient of soil available nitrogen within a 60-ha stem-mapping plot in a montane tropical rainforest in Hainan Island, China, and we evaluated their spatial distribution and neighbourhood diversity. 3. Results show that the levels of BNF activity are tightly correlated with legume association to available soil nitrogen, where legumes associated with nitrogen-rich habitats exhibit surprisingly greater BNF activity and a more diverse neighbourhood. 4. Synthesis. These findings indicate that legumes satisfy their nitrogen-demanding metabolism through a synergy of habitat preference and BNF activity. High BNF activity drives local diversity by promoting complementary resource utilization rather than intensifying above-ground competition. This may be achieved by improving litter quality and stimulating mycorrhizal and microbial diversity. The abundance of nitrogen fixers in nitrogen-rich habitats also explains how legumes contribute to maintaining high levels of soil nitrogen in tropical forests.","2019",NA,"10.1111/1365-2745.13017","WOS:000459070600020"

According to an estimate, approximately 5.2 billion hectares (ha) of agricultural land is subject to soil degradation, erosion, and salinity. The salt-affected soil in India is about 8.1 million ha, with 3.1 million ha coastal saline soil, 2.8 million ha sodic soil, and the remaining 2.2 million ha saline soil located inland. Even though salinity has already significantly affected the fertile lands, the land area under salinity is still increasing due to various anthropogenic activities as artificial irrigation, improper water management, blocking of natural drainage system, and similar human interferences with the environment. In saline-affected soils, the rhizosphere environment becomes unfavorable and inhospitable for growth of plants and microbes, although there may be sufficient amount of water and nutrients in soils. Overuse of artificial fertilizers and chemical pesticides causes long-term degradation of natural soil fertility and creates environmental pollutions. The degradation of soil fertility, in combination with an estimated rise of the world population to 8.5 billion over the next 25 years, calls for additional strategies to ensure the worldwide requirement of food supply. The development of sustainable and safe means for agriculture production will be necessary, which includes enhancing the output on arid and saline areas to avoid further loss of cultivable land. The application of bioinoculants like plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) has the potential to enhance plant growth under abiotic stress conditions and to avoid soil degradation at the same time. This kind of plant-microbe interaction is based on biological processes and has the potential to change conventional agricultural practices to a vital and sustainable agriculture. In such a world, microbes take over an important role as an ecological actor to resolve environmental stress problems. Another natural way to enhance plant growth and marginal land use is in planting different species simultaneously at the same space (intercropping), as, e.g., intercropping of legumes and cereals. Highly promising are techniques where plants with different root systems are grown together, which do not compete for the same space in the soil. The different abilities of intercropping plant species to use ephemeral or permanent water sources strongly affect physiological performance and species coexistence in water-limited ecosystems. Therefore, the present chapter highlights the various techniques to counteract crop loss in marginal soil and explore various beneficial biofertilizers and their modes of action in terms of abiotic stress tolerance and reduction to enhance agricultural production in a sustainable way.","2019",NA,"10.1007/978-981-13-8805-7_8","WOS:000569398900010"

In one Mexican community, 95% of species recruit through facilitation; Mimosa luisana being a keystone nurse for many of them. M. luisana individuals manifest greater fitness when growing in association with their facilitated plants than when growing in isolation. This observation suggests that nurses also benefit from their facilitated plants, a benefit thought to be mediated by mycorrhizal fungi. Under field conditions, we experimentally tested whether mycorrhizal fungi mediate the increased fitness that M. luisana experiences when growing in association with its facilitated plants. We applied fungicide to the soil for nurse plants growing alone and growing in association with their facilitated plants in order to reduce the mycorrhizal colonisation of roots. We then assessed the quantity and quality of seed production of M. luisana in four treatments (isolated-control, isolated-fungicide, associated-control and associated-fungicide). Fungicide application reduced the percentage root length colonised by mycorrhizae and reduced fitness of M. luisana when growing in association with their facilitated plants but not when growing in isolation. This reduction was reflected in the total number of seeds, number of seeds per pod, seed mass and seed viability. These results suggest that nurses benefit from the presence of their facilitated plants through links established by mycorrhizae, indicating that both plants and belowground mutualistic communities are all part of one system, coexisting by means of intrinsically linked interactions.","2019",NA,"10.1111/plb.12948","WOS:000473626000012"
"Picot, A; Monnin, T; Loeuille, N","From apparent competition to facilitation: Impacts of consumer niche construction on the coexistence and stability of consumer-resource communities","FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY","In addition to their direct trophic effects, some consumers have a positive indirect effect on their resource, due to niche construction. A predator can facilitate its prey resource acquisition, through prey transport, or through modifications of nutrient cycling. Alternatively, a predator may defend its prey against other predators, or actively manage it, as in agriculture, which is found in numerous taxa such as humans, ants, beetles, fishes and microbes. Here, we investigate the ecological consequences of considering such positive effects in a simple two-resource-one-consumer module, in which the consumer has a positive effect on one of the resources. We consider several scenarios, in which the positive effect on the resource is either not costly, that is resulting from a by-product of the consumer phenotype such as nutrient cycling, or costly. The cost either decreases the exploitation of the cultivated resource or the opportunity to forage the alternative resource. We investigate how the intensity of niche construction impacts species coexistence, the distribution of biomass among the three species and the stability of the community. We show that by modifying the trophic interactions in the module, niche construction alters the apparent competition between the resources, thereby impacting their coexistence. When niche construction has little or no cost to the consumer, it leads to higher consumer and cultivated resource densities, while decreasing the alternative resource density. Alternatively, when niche construction has higher costs, the alternative resource can increase in density, niche construction thereby leading to the emergence of facilitative interactions among resource species.

Although Japanese Arisaema species hybridize from artificial crossing, hybrid individuals are rare in mixed populations; suggesting the presence of effective pre-pollination barriers. We examined the following reproductive barriers between A. sikokianum and A. tosaense: habitat, phenology, and pollinator isolations. Methods Habitat isolation was examined by interspecific comparisons of microhabitat conditions at a mixed site and of altitude at the sampling site of herbarium specimens. Phenological isolation was evaluated by comparing seasonal transition in apparent spathe condition and frequency of insect visitation. Pollinator isolation was examined by comparing floral visitor assemblages between the two Arisaema species. To avoid overestimation of pollinator isolation due to seasonal changes in insect assemblages, we also compared visitor assemblages between natural and late-flowering A. sikokianum, where the latter was experimentally introduced and blooming with a natural A. tosaense population. Results Microhabitat conditions and sampling elevations of herbarium specimens overlapped between the two Arisaema species. At the population level, A. sikokianum and A. tosaense flowered for 39 and 52 days, respectively, with 13 days overlap. Insect visitation in A. sikokianum decreased before the seasonal overlap. Floral visitor assemblages differed between the two Arisaema species, while the difference between natural and late-flowering A. sikokianum was less distinct. Conclusions Phenological and pollinator isolation contribute to reproductive isolation between the two Arisaema species and should enable the two species to coexist in this area.","2019","NOV 2019","10.1002/ajb2.1389","WOS:000496423300001"

Here, we test species-specific responses to size-asymmetric competition under various soil environments by manipulating plant size as well as soil fertility, nutrient heterogeneity and the initial suppression of microbial communities within a three-species community. Competition was primarily size-asymmetric; however, the degree to which competition was size-asymmetric was species-specific, where three out of five soil treatments resulted in size-asymmetric competition in some species but size-symmetric competition in others. Overall, soil fertility and nutrient heterogeneity altered the degree of size-asymmetric competition, while the initial suppression of microbial communities had no effect. Contrary to past predictions, when they had an effect, increased soil fertility and the presence of a high-quality patch reduced the degree of size-asymmetric competition, while the presence of a low-quality patch increased it. This suggests that the role nutrient heterogeneity plays on the degree of size-asymmetric competition is dependent on the quality and location of the patch relative to an individual's neighbours. These findings challenge the current understanding that competition for soil resources is always size-symmetric and demonstrate that species within the same community may not experience the same degree of size-dependent competition. These differential responses suggest we must consider variations in tolerance and suppression between species during size-dependent plant-plant interactions, which may promote species coexistence as all small individuals may not be negatively impacted during size-dependent competition.

Range shifts may cause novel assemblages of competing species because species may respond to changing climate at different rates. Range-expanding species may directly influence resident species through resource competition or indirectly by modifying the local environment both aboveground and belowground. Further, range-expanding plant species can create novel plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) by altering soil microbial community structure and function and the interactions of resident plant species with microbial symbionts. These changes can have important implications for resident plant population dynamics and their ability to coexist with novel competitors. Here we test the impacts of competitive interactions and plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) of a range-expanding sagebrush species (Artemisia rothrockii) on the demography and population growth rates of two resident alpine plant species (Koeleria macrantha and Eriogonum ovalifolium). We use an experimental, multi-year field approach combined with integral projection modeling to determine how PSFs and competition influence species coexistence in both the historic and range expansion zone of A. rothrockii. We find that sagebrush has an overall net negative effect on herbaceous plant demography, primarily due to negative PSFs for plants growing in sagebrush-conditioned soil. However, these negative soil effects are partially buffered via facilitation effects for herbs growing under or nearby sagebrush canopies. In general, population growth rates were more sensitive to survival than other demographic rates, furthermore this sensitivity to survival was higher for herbaceous species in sagebrush soils. Identifying the major drivers of plant population dynamics and species interactions remains an important and unresolved question in ecology. PSFs are a central mechanism influencing plant species interactions, yet the majority of PSF research has made little direct connection between plant population dynamics and PSFs in situ. We believe that utilizing a field-based approach, focusing on multiple components of plant demography, is an important next step in understanding the role of PSFs and species interactions in a changing world.","2019",NA,"10.3389/fevo.2019.00417","WOS:001029989700001"

"Grainger, TN; Letten, AD; Gilbert, B; Fukami, T","Applying modern coexistence theory to priority effects","PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA","Modern coexistence theory is increasingly used to explain how differences between competing species lead to coexistence versus competitive exclusion. Although research testing this theory has focused on deterministic cases of competitive exclusion, in which the same species always wins, mounting evidence suggests that competitive exclusion is often historically contingent, such that whichever species happens to arrive first excludes the other. Coexistence theory predicts that historically contingent exclusion, known as priority effects, will occur when large destabilizing differences (positive frequency-dependent growth rates of competitors), combined with small fitness differences (differences in competitors' intrinsic growth rates and sensitivity to competition), create conditions under which neither species can invade an established population of its competitor. Here we extend the empirical application of modern coexistence theory to determine the conditions that promote priority effects. We conducted pairwise invasion tests with four strains of nectar-colonizing yeasts to determine how the destabilizing and fitness differences that drive priority effects are altered by two abiotic factors characterizing the nectar environment: sugar concentration and pH. We found that higher sugar concentrations increased the likelihood of priority effects by reducing fitness differences between competing species. In contrast, higher pH did not change the likelihood of priority effects, but instead made competition more neutral by bringing both fitness differences and destabilizing differences closer to zero. This study demonstrates how the empirical partitioning of priority effects into fitness and destabilizing components can elucidate the pathways through which environmental conditions shape competitive interactions.","2019",NA,"10.1073/pnas.1803122116","WOS:000462382800060"

Soil microbes may promote plant diversity by driving negative frequency-dependent plant population dynamics, or may favor species exclusion by providing one species an average fitness advantage over others. However, past empirical research has focused overwhelmingly on the consequences of frequency-dependent feedbacks for plant species coexistence and has generally neglected the consequences of microbially mediated average fitness differences. Here we use theory to develop metrics that quantify microbially mediated plant fitness differences, and show that accounting for these effects can profoundly change our understanding of how microbes influence plant diversity. We show that soil microbes can generate fitness differences that favour plant species exclusion when they disproportionately harm (or favour) one plant species over another, but these fitness differences may also favor coexistence if they trade off with competition for other resources or generate intransitive dominance hierarchies among plants. We also show how the metrics we present can quantify microbially mediated fitness differences in empirical studies, and explore how microbial control over coexistence varies along productivity gradients. In all, our analysis provides a more complete theoretical foundation for understanding how plant-microbe interactions influence plant diversity.","2019",NA,"10.1111/ele.13280","WOS:000475659400001"

Moreover, it is unclear whether classic approaches for studying competition, which were developed predominantly for pairs of interacting species, will fully capture dynamics in complex species assemblages. We parameterized a population-dynamic model using competition experiments of two native and three exotic species from a grassland community. We found evidence for minimal fitness differences or niche differences between the native species, leading to slow replacement dynamics and priority effects, but large fitness advantages allowed exotics to unconditionally invade natives. Priority effects driven by strong interspecific competition between exotic species drove single-species dominance by one of two exotic species in 80% of model outcomes, while a complex mixture of nonhierarchical competition and coexistence between native and exotic species occurred in the remaining 20%. Fungal infection, a commonly hypothesized coexistence mechanism, had weak fitness effects and is unlikely to substantially affect coexistence.

"Legault, G; Fox, JW; Melbourne, BA","Demographic stochasticity alters expected outcomes in experimental and simulated non-neutral communities","OIKOS","Theory has shown that the effects of demographic stochasticity on communities may depend on the magnitude of fitness differences between species. In particular, it has been suggested that demographic stochasticity has the potential to significantly alter competitive outcomes when fitness differences are small (nearly neutral), but that it has negligible effects when fitness differences are large (highly non-neutral). Here we test such theory experimentally and extend it to examine how demographic stochasticity affects exclusion frequency and mean densities of consumers in simple, but non-neutral, consumer-resource communities. We used experimental microcosms of protists and rotifers feeding on a bacterial resource to test how varying absolute population sizes (a driver of demographic stochasticity) affected the probability of competitive exclusion of the weakest competitor. To explore whether demographic stochasticity could explain our experimental results, and to generalize beyond our experiment, we paired the experiment with a continuous-time stochastic model of resource competition, which we simulated for 11 different fitness inequalities between competiting consumers. Consistent with theory, in both our experiments and our simulations we found that demographic stochasticity altered competitive outcomes in communities where fitness differences were small. However, we also found that demographic stochasticity alone could affect communities in other ways, even when fitness differences between competitors were large. Specifically, demographic stochasticity altered mean densities of both weak and strong competitors in experimental and simulated communities. These findings highlight how demographic stochasticity can change both competitive outcomes in non-neutral communities and the processes underlying overall community dynamics.","2019",NA,"10.1111/oik.06028","WOS:000499700800003"

These two strategies use different carbon sources and reside within different ecological niches for microbial aggregation, which were hypothesized to show distinct microbial structures and metabolic fitness. We surveyed three floc reactors and three biofilm reactors for denitrification and determined if there were distinct microbial aggregations. Multiple molecular omics approaches were used to determine the microbial community composition, co-occurrence network and metabolic pathways. Proteobacteria was the dominating and most active phylum among all samples. Carbon source played an important role in shaping the microbial community composition while the distribution of functional protein was largely influenced by salinity. We found that the topological network features had different ecological patterns and that the microorganisms in the biofilm reactors had more nodes but less interactions than those in floc reactors. The large niche differences in the biofilm reactors explained the observed high microbial diversity, functional redundancy and resulting high system stability. We also observed a lower proportion of denitrifiers and higher resistance to oxygen and salinity perturbation in the biofilm reactors than the floc reactors. Our findings support our hypothesis that niche differences caused a distinct microbial structure and increased microbial ecology distribution, which has the potential to improve system efficiency and stability.","2019",NA,"10.1016/j.envint.2019.105085","WOS:000493552400045"

Those viral variants that have the greatest fitness are fixed. We recently showed different fitness for HBV variants involved in two epidemiological situations. To understand these fitness differences better, we determined the levels of extracellular HBV DNA, the synthesis of HBV DNA intermediates, and the expression of HBeAg and HBsAg in transfection and cotransfection assays. Our results show that for the subgenotype (sgt) D1, which has an 8-nucleotide deletion (sgtD1del) and exhibits lower fitness, the levels of extracellular DNA and intracellular replicative intermediates were much lower than with sgtD1wt or sgtD1mut (G1896A), which had higher fitness. In addition, in the cotransfection assay, sgtD1del inhibited sgtD1mut but not sgtD1wt replication. We also found that sgtF1b, which exhibits higher fitness, produces significantly higher levels of both extracellular DNA and intracellular replicative intermediates than does the lower-fitness sgtF4. These results demonstrate a relationship between fitness and the replicative ability of the HBV genome in the transfection assay. In addition, the data obtained by cotransfecting cells with sgtD1del and sgtD1mut provide new information about the impact of simultaneous replication of two viral variants in the same cell system on HBV replication.","2019",NA,"10.1007/s00705-018-4090-5","WOS:000458284300011"

The movement of one cell in these crowded assemblages requires motion of others, so that cell displacements are correlated over many cell diameters. Whenever movement is important for survival or growth, these correlated rearrangements could couple the evolutionary fate of different lineages. However, little is known about the interplay between mechanical forces and evolution in dense cellular populations. Here, by tracking slower-growing clones at the expanding edge of yeast colonies, we show that the collective motion of cells prevents costly mutations from being weeded out rapidly. Joint pushing by neighbouring cells generates correlated movements that suppress the differential displacements required for selection to act. This mechanical screening of fitness differences allows slower-growing mutants to leave more descendants than expected under non-mechanical models, thereby increasing their chance for evolutionary rescue. Our work suggests that, in crowded populations, cells cooperate with surrounding neighbours through inevitable mechanical interactions. This effect has to be considered when predicting evolutionary outcomes, such as the emergence of drug resistance or cancer evolution.","2019",NA,"10.1038/s41559-018-0734-9","WOS:000453767000022"

A critical step in exploring microgenderome is to dissect the sex differences in key community ecology properties, which has not been systematically analyzed. This study aims at filling the gap by reanalyzing the Human Microbiome Project datasets with two objectives: (i) dissecting the sex differences in community diversity and their intersubject scaling, species composition, core/periphery species, and high-salience skeletons (species interactions); (ii) offering mechanistic interpretations for (i).

Methodologically, seven approaches reflecting the state-of-the-art research in medical ecology of human microbiomes are harnessed to achieve the objectives. It is postulated that the revealed microgenderome characteristics (categorized as seven aspects of differences/similarities) exert far reaching influences on disease susceptibility, and are primarily due to the sex difference in selection effects (deterministic fitness differences in microbial species and/or species interactions with each other or with their hosts), which are, in turn, shaped/modulated by host physiology (immunity, hormones, gut-brain communications, etc.).","2019","OCT 2019","10.1002/advs.201902054","WOS:000491576000001"

Microbial symbionts are proposed to have profound effects on fitness of their host plants and vice versa, especially when their fitness is tightly linked. Here we studied local adaptation of host plants and possible fitness contribution of such symbiosis in the context of abiotic environmental factors. We conducted a four-way multi-year reciprocal transplant experiment with natural populations of the perennial grass Festuca rubra s.l. from northern and southern Finland, Faroe Islands and Spain.

Termites consume a wide range of plant material at different stages of decomposition and, accordingly, have been classified into 'feeding groups'. African savannah ecosystems harbour many termite species, yet most belong to Termitidae. Especially striking is the co-occurrence of up to eight Macrotermitinae and five Trinervitermes species, each having apparently identical trophic niches, i.e. fungus-growers and grass-feeders, respectively. 2. This study examined stable isotope signatures of N-15 and C-13 of West African savannah termites to test the validity of existing feeding group concepts and whether there is fine-scaled niche differentiation of species within feeding groups. Despite a phylogenetic signal that species from the same subfamily and congenerics have correlated isotope signatures, evidence of niche differentiation was found. 3. Interestingly, species with similar delta N-15 values generally differed in delta C-13 values, and vice versa. The dominant mound-building fungus-grower Macrotermes bellicosus had the lowest delta N-15 values among all fungus-growers, indicating that it occupies a different trophic niche. 4.

After 146 days of operation, we found the anammox bacterial population shifted from Ca. Jettenia to Ca.

However, whether this niche segregation is maintained under field conditions in terrestrial ecosystems remains unresolved, particularly at the global scale. We hypothesized that perennial vegetation might favor AOB vs. AOA communities compared with adjacent open areas devoid of perennial vegetation (i.e., bare soil) via several mechanisms, including increasing the amount of ammonium in soil. To test this niche-differentiation hypothesis, we conducted a global field survey including 80 drylands from 6 continents. Data supported our hypothesis, as soils collected under plant canopies had higher levels of ammonium, as well as higher richness (number of terminal restriction fragments; T-RFs) and abundance (qPCR amoA genes) of AOB, and lower richness and abundance of AOA, than those collected in open areas located between plant canopies. Some of the reported associations between plant canopies and AOA and AOB communities can be a consequence of the higher organic matter and available N contents found under plant canopies. Other aspects of soils associated with vegetation including shading and microclimatic conditions might also help explain our results. Our findings provide strong evidence for niche differentiation between AOA and AOB communities in drylands worldwide, advancing our understanding of their ecology and biogeography at the global scale.","2019",NA,"10.1038/s41396-019-0465-1","WOS:000490275400009"

Because closely related clades have similar metabolic potential, it is unclear how diversity is sustained and what factors drive niche differentiation. In this study, we retrieved three near-complete Competibacter lineage genomes from activated sludge metagenomes at a full-scale pure oxygen activated sludge wastewater treatment plant. The three genomes represent unique taxa within the Competibacteraceae. A comparison of the genomes revealed differences in capacity for exopolysaccharide (EPS) biosynthesis, glucose fermentation to lactate, and motility. Using quantitative PCR (qPCR), we monitored these clades over a 2-year period. The Glade possessing genes for motility and lacking genes for EPS biosynthesis (CPB_P15) was dominant during periods of suspended solids in the effluent. Further analysis of operational parameters indicate that the dominance of the CPB_P15 Glade is associated with low-return activated sludge recycle rates and low wasting rates, conditions that maintain relatively high levels of biomass within the system. IMPORTANCE Members of the Competibacter lineage are relevant in biotechnology as glycogen-accumulating organisms (GAOs). Here, we document the presence of three Competibacteraceae clades in a full-scale activated sludge wastewater treatment plant and their linkage to specific operational conditions. We find evidence for niche differentiation among the three clades with temporal variability in Glade dominance that correlates with operational changes at the treatment plant. Specifically, we observe episodic dominance of a likely motile Glade during periods of elevated effluent turbidity, as well as episodic dominance of closely related nonmotile clades that likely enhance floc formation during periods of low effluent turbidity.","2019",NA,"10.1128/AEM.02301-18","WOS:000459327600007"

Progress requires determining which processes and species differences are most important for coexistence when multiple processes operate and species differ in many ways. Modern coexistence theory (MCT), formalised by Chesson, holds out the promise of doing that, but empirical applications remain scarce. We argue that MCT's mathematical complexity and subtlety have obscured the simplicity and power of its underlying ideas and hindered applications. We present a general computational approach that extends our previous solution for the storage effect to all of standard MCT's spatial and temporal coexistence mechanisms, and also process-defined mechanisms amenable to direct study such as resource partitioning, indirect competition, and life history trade-offs. The main components are a method to partition population growth rates into contributions from different mechanisms and their interactions, and numerical calculations in which some mechanisms are removed and others retained. We illustrate how our approach handles features that have not been analysed in the standard framework through several case studies: competing diatom species under fluctuating temperature, plant-soil feedbacks in grasslands, facilitation in a beach grass community, and niche differences with independent effects on recruitment, survival and growth in sagebrush steppe.","2019",NA,"10.1111/ele.13159","WOS:000453562900001"

To understand host dependence and niche differentiation of organ-specific microbiome signatures using a 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing technique, we systematically provided characterizations of a comparative framework relevant to the microbiome of stomach, regional intestine, skin, and gill in two important farmed fish species, herbivorous grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) and carnivorous southern catfish (Silurus meridionalis), and of the rearing water. The different feeding habits of grass carp and southern catfish showed a significant separation of microbial community structure, with great compositional differences across body sites within each species. Site-driven divergences relied on host species: the same types of microhabitats between grass carp and southern catfish harbored differential microbiome. Additionally, body sites had remarkably distinct communities and displayed lower alpha diversity compared to rearing water. Unexpectedly, the stomach of southern catfish had the highest microbial diversity in the digestive tract of the two co-cultured fish species. For external sites within each species, a higher diversity occurred in gill of grass carp and in skin of southern catfish. Our results unveil different topographical microbiome signatures of the co-cultured species, indicating host selection in individual-level microbial assemblages and niche differentiation at the organ scale.

Experimental evidence suggests that an increase in the water nutrient level would promote the performance of several invasive free-floating macrophytes. However, few studies have focused on how a shift in water nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) stoichiometric regimes may influence the performance of invasive free-floating macrophytes. In the present study, two exotic invasive plant species, free-floating Eichhornia crassipes and Pistia stratiotes, were subjected to different water nutrient stoichiometric regimes, and their phenotypic performance was studied. We found that the two species converged in several resource use traits and diverged in lateral root length. This implied that their similarities in fitness-correlated traits and their underwater niche differentiation probably contribute to their stable coexistence in the field. Additionally, the eutrophic conditions in the different N:P regimes scarcely altered the performance of both species compared to their performance in the oligotrophic condition. Based on previous studies, we predicted that moderate eutrophication with slight overloading of nitrogen and phosphorus would not improve the performance of several invasive free-floating plants and thus would scarcely alter the invasive status of these species. However, moderate eutrophication may cause other problems, such as the growth of phytoplankton and algae and increased pollution in the water.","2019","NOV 2019","10.1007/s11356-019-06304-6","WOS:000495198500003"

In addition, when those communities are run in steady state, the influence of environmental factors on their assembly is reduced. Therefore, one would expect similar community structures under steady-state conditions. Yet, in parallel setups, variability does occur. To reveal ecological mechanisms behind this phenomenon, five parallel reactors were studied at the single-cell level for about 100 generations and community structure variations were quantified by ecological measures. Whether community variability can be controlled was tested by implementing soft temperature stressors as potential synchronizers. The low slope of the lognormal rank-order abundance curves indicated a predominance of neutral mechanisms, i.e., where species identity plays no role. Variations in abundance ranks of subcommunities and increase in inter-community pairwise beta-diversity over time support this. Niche differentiation was also observed, as indicated by steeper geometric-like rank-order abundance curves and increased numbers of correlations between abiotic and biotic parameters during initial adaptation and after disturbances. Still, neutral forces dominated community assembly.

However, the effectiveness of DMPP varies among soils, and this is due to both abiotic (e.g. soil properties) and biotic factors (e.g. ammonia oxidizers and denitrifier communities). Understanding the nature of these effects is necessary to improve the efficacy of DMPP, therefore encouraging wider adoption and environmental benefits. In particular, soil microbial properties associated with variation in efficacy remain largely unknown. In this study four contrasting arable soils (a grey desert soil, an alluvial paddy soil, a loess formed paddy soil, and a red soil), were characterized based on DMPP inhibition of N2O emissions and associated microbial functional guilds. DMPP significantly inhibited nitrification and N2O emissions, with an average inhibitory rate ranging from 41.7% in a red soil to 90.0% in a grey desert soil. Ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) exhibited contrasting response patterns to DMPP addition. Notably, suppression of N2O emissions by DMPP only occurred alongside fluctuations in AOB abundance. However, when AOB were inhibited, AOA abundance increased. Soil-dependent response patterns to DMPP were observed for ammonia oxidizers and denitrifiers in terms of community structure. Partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) found that abiotic factors, particularly pH, and biological factors such as ammonia oxidizer communities, were closely linked to N2O emissions. Our findings provide evidence that: (i) DMPP effectively inhibits nitrification through inhibiting the abundance of AOB across soil types; (ii) releasing AOA from the competition with AOB allows AOA to efficiently grow and multiply, even under high ammonium conditions; and (iii) abiotic factors play a more important role than biotic factors in soil N2O emissions.","2019",NA,"10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.11.027","WOS:000458223500010"

Despite intensive investigations of the taxonomic structure in root microbiomes, there is relatively little biochemical knowledge of the metabolic niches occupied by microbial strains in the rhizosphere. Here, we review new tools and approaches that are boosting our knowledge of the metabolic mechanisms that shape the composition of the root microbiome. New studies have elucidated biochemical pathways that mediate root colonisation and pathogen suppression, and synthetic communities are emerging as a powerful tool to understand microbe-microbe interactions. Knowledge of root exudate composition is being advanced by new metabolomics methodologies, which have highlighted that specific exudate components can inhibit pathogen growth, and that certain metabolites can recruit mutualistic strains according to substrate uptake preferences. Microbial genomics is rapidly advancing, with large collections of isolated rhizosphere strains and mutant libraries giving new insights into the metabolic mechanisms of root colonisation. Exometabolomics is emerging as a powerful methodology for directly observing microbial uptake of root metabolites, and also for profiling microbial cross-feeding. Integrative studies using these resources should enable rapid advances, particularly when applied to standardised experimental set-ups and model synthetic communities.","2019",NA,"10.1093/jxb/ery438","WOS:000459352500004"

However, a comprehensive understanding of the diversity and community composition of microbiome associated with different plant compartments as well as bulk soils of cycad species remains elusive. Method An extensive investigation of species diversity and community composition of bacterial and fungal microbiome in roots, seeds, unfertilized seeds, ovules, pollens, and soils of Cycas panzhihuaensis L. Zhou & S. Y. Yang has been conducted by high-through sequencing technology. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and heatmap analysis were applied to test the niche-specific effect and biogeography factor among different sample types of this cycad species. Results Highly diverse microbiota and significant variation of community structure were found among different compartments of C. panzhihuaensis. Soils exhibited a remarkable differentiation of bacterial community composition compared to the other five plant organs as revealed by PCA, HCA, and heatmap analyses. Different compartments possessed unique core microbial taxa with Pseudomonadaceae and Nectriaceae shared among them. According to the indicator species analysis, there was almost no differentiation of dominant microbiomes with regard to the geography of the host cycad. Two main transmission models existed in the C. panzhihuaensis. Conclusions Each sample type represented a unique niche and hosted a niche-specific core microbial taxa. Contrary to previous surveys, biogeography hardly exerted impact on microbial community variation in this study. The majority of the cycad-associated microbes were horizontally derived from soils and/or air environments with the rest vertically inherited from maternal plants via seeds. This study offers a robust knowledge of plant-microbiome interaction across various plant compartments and soils and lends guidelines to the investigation of adaptation mechanism of cycads in arid and nutrient-poor environments as well as their evolutionary conservation.","2019",NA,"10.1186/s40168-019-0770-y","WOS:000500995400001"

This is an issue of major environmental relevance, as many ecosystems have experienced changes in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) due to anthropogenic manipulation of nutrient loading. To understand how changes in N and P limitation may impact community structure, we conducted laboratory competition experiments using a multispecies phytoplankton community sampled from the North Sea. Results showed that picocyanobacteria (Cyanobium sp.) won the competition under N limitation, while picocyanobacteria and nonmotile nanophytoplankton (Nannochloropsis sp.) coexisted at equal abundances under P limitation. Additional experiments using isolated monocultures confirmed that Cyanobium sp. depleted N to lower levels than Nannochloropsis sp., but that both species had nearly identical P requirements, suggesting a potential for neutral coexistence under P-limited conditions. Pairwise competition experiments with the two isolates seemed to support the consistency of these results, but P limitation resulted in stable species coexistence irrespective of the initial conditions rather than the random drift of species abundances predicted by neutral theory. Comparison of the light absorption spectra indicates that coexistence of the two species was stabilized through differential use of the underwater light spectrum. Our results provide an interesting experimental example of modern coexistence theory, where species were equal competitors in one niche dimension but their competitive traits differed in other niche dimensions, thus enabling stable species coexistence on a single limiting nutrient through niche differentiation in the light spectrum.","2019","SEP 2019","10.1002/ecy.2873","WOS:000487454100001"

Based on previous studies, niche differentiation could exist between nirK- and nirS-nitrite reducers and nosZI- and nosZII-N2O reducers, and nosZII-bacteria would have a key role for N2O reduction in soils. Most previous studies have been performed for agricultural systems but never in the moist savanna zone which covers half a million lane in West Africa and whose soils are among the poorest in nitrogen (N) on earth. Here, we quantified potential gross and net N2O production rates along with the abundances of nirK-, nirS-, nosZl- and nosZII-harbouring bacteria for soils under six agricultural practices with maize rotations (slash-and-burn, chemical fertilization, mulching with or without inclusion of crop legumes, and without any input) after 4 and 5 crop cycles at nine sites in Ivory Coast. Sites and practices influenced denitrifier abundances and activities, the ratio of total abundances of nitrite-to-N2O reducers being highest and lowest for the mulching + green soya and slash-and-burn practices, respectively. Using structural equation modelling, we showed that nirS- and nosZI-bacteria both strongly depended on nitrate availability whereas nirK- and nosZII-bacteria were related to soil organic carbon and pH. Furthermore, potential gross and net N2O production rates depended strongly and only on the abundances of nirS- and nosZI-bacteria.

Both pronounced niche differentiation and neutral dynamics have been suggested as mechanisms underlying that high diversity. Differential resource use is the most plausible basis for niche differentiation, yet the vast majority of studies demonstrating that this is prominent in marine nematodes are based on laboratory experiments on single species or highly simplified assemblages. Only a small number of studies have investigated resource differentiation under natural conditions. Here we use natural stable-isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen, as well as fatty-acid profiles, to assess differential resource use and trophic structure in nine abundant estuarine tidal flat nematode species, comprising different presumed feeding modes (deposit feeders, epistratum feeders, predators) and resource guilds (herbivores, carnivores) based on buccal cavity morphology. Nematodes comprise up to three different trophic levels (from primary to tertiary consumers), yet with the exception of some herbivores, omnivory is prominent. Bivariate isotopic niche spaces were of similar size among most species, irrespective of their trophic level. Herbivory not only contributed importantly to the nutrition of suspected herbivores, but also to that of species that were previously considered carnivores based on the morphology of their buccal cavity. Herbivory mainly targets diatoms in some nematode species, yet includes dinoflagellates in others. Bacteria, in contrast, appear to be of limited nutritional importance. Odontophora setosus is identified as a predator/omnivore (possibly of heterotrophic protists) with a trophic level in between that of secondary and tertiary consumers. Our study thus demonstrates that resource differentiation is pronounced among as well as within nematode feeding modes and resource guilds. However, this study included only the most abundant species of the in situ community, hence it remains to be established whether and to what extent its conclusions can be extrapolated to entire, often highly species-rich communities.","2019",NA,"10.7717/peerj.7864","WOS:000489699200012"

Besides Nitrospira, Candidatus Nitrotoga has been identified as a key nitrite-oxidizing bacterium (NOB) performing the second step of nitrification, nitrite oxidation to nitrate, in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). However, the driving forces for the dominance of Nitrotoga in certain plants have often remained unclear and could not be explained solely by temperature effects. In this study, we characterized the physiology of the ammonium-dependent Nitrotoga sp. BS with regard to temperature and pH variations and evaluated its competitiveness against Nitrospira defluvii. Both NOB originated from the same WWTP and shared a comparable pH optimum of 7.3. Based on these results, coculturing experiments with these NOB were performed in batch reactors operated at either 17 degrees C or 22 degrees C to compare their abundances under optimal (pH 7.4) or suboptimal (pH 6.4) conditions using 1 mM nitrite. As revealed by quantitative PCR (qPCR), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and 16S amplicon sequencing, Nitrotoga sp. BS was clearly favored by its optimal growth parameters and dominated over Ns. defluvii at pH 7.4 and 17 degrees C, whereas a pH of 6.4 was more selective for Ns. defluvii. Our synthetic communities revealed that niche differentiation of NOB is influenced by a complex interaction of environmental parameters and has to be evaluated for single species. IMPORTANCE Ca. Nitrotoga is a NOB of high environmental relevance, but physiological data exist for only a few representatives. Initially, it was detected in specialized niches of low temperature and low nitrite concentrations, but later on, its ubiquitous distribution revealed its critical role for N removal in engineered systems like WWTPs. In this study, we analyzed the competition between Nitrotoga and Nitrospira in bioreactors and identified conditions where the K strategist Ns. defluvii was almost replaced by Nitrotoga sp. BS. We show that the pH value is an important factor that regulates the composition of the nitrite-oxidizing enrichment with a dominance of Nitrotoga sp. BS versus Ns. defluvii at a neutral pH of 7.4 in combination with a temperature of 17 degrees C. The physiological diversity of novel Nitrotoga cultures improves our knowledge about niche differentiation of NOB with regard to functional nitrification under suboptimal conditions.","2019",NA,"10.1128/AEM.02569.18","WOS:000464986200013"
"Picoche, C; Barraquand, F","How self-regulation, the storage effect, and their interaction contribute to coexistence in stochastic and seasonal environments","THEORETICAL ECOLOGY","Explaining coexistence in species-rich communities of primary producers remains a challenge for ecologists because of their likely competition for shared resources. Following Hutchinson's seminal suggestion, many theoreticians have tried to create diversity through a fluctuating environment, which impairs or slows down competitive exclusion. However, fluctuating environment models often only produce a dozen of coexisting species at best. Here, we investigate how to create richer communities in fluctuating environments, using an empirically parameterized model. Building on the forced Lotka-Volterra model of Scranton and Vasseur (Theor Ecol 9(3):353-363, 2016), inspired by phytoplankton communities, we have investigated the effect of two coexistence mechanisms, namely the storage effect and higher intra- than interspecific competition strengths (i.e., strong self-regulation). We tuned the intra/inter-competition ratio based on empirical analyses, in which self-regulation dominates interspecific interactions. Although a strong self-regulation maintained more species (50%) than the storage effect (25%), we show that none of the two coexistence mechanisms considered could ensure the coexistence of all species alone. Realistic seasonal environments only aggravated that picture, as they decreased persistence relative to a random environment. However, strong self-regulation and the storage effect combined superadditively so that all species could persist with both mechanisms at work. Our results suggest that combining different coexistence mechanisms into community models might be more fruitful than trying to find which mechanism best explains diversity. We additionally highlight that while biomass-trait distributions provide some clues regarding coexistence mechanisms, they cannot indicate unequivocally which mechanisms are at play.","2019",NA,"10.1007/s12080-019-0420-9","WOS:000501070500008"

We characterized the seasonal dynamics of MGII populations in the southern North Sea on a genomic and microscopic level over the course of four years. We recovered 34 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of MGIIa and MGIIb that corroborated proteorhodopsin-based photoheterotrophic lifestyles. However, MGIIa and MGIIb MAG genome sizes differed considerably (similar to 1.9 vs. similar to 1.4 Mbp), as did their transporter, peptidase, flagella and sulfate assimilation gene repertoires. MGIIb populations were characteristic of winter samples, whereas MGIIa accounted for up to 23% of the community at the beginning of summer. Both clades consisted of annually recurring, sequence-discrete populations with low intra-population sequence diversity. Oligotyping of filtered cell-size fractions and microscopy consistently suggested that MGII cells were predominantly free-living. Cells were coccoid and similar to 0.7 mu m in diameter, likely resulting in grazing avoidance. Based on multiple lines of evidence, we propose distinct niche adaptations of MGIIa and MGIIb Euryarchaeota populations that are characteristic of summer and winter conditions in the coastal North Sea.","2019",NA,"10.1038/s41396-019-0491-z","WOS:000497952500011"

Ammonia oxidation is the rate-limiting step of nitrification, conducted by ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). However, it remains a debatable issue regarding dominant ammonia oxidizers in this region, and environmental factors driving their spatiotemporal niche differentiation have yet to be identified. In this study, intertidal and subtidal zones of Zhoushan Islands were selected for seasonal sampling. Ammonia-oxidizing activity, quantitative PCR, and 454 high-throughput sequencing were performed to study the nitrification potential, abundance, and community structure of ammonia-oxidizing archaea and bacteria. AOA and AOB amoA abundance (10(7)-10(8)amoA gene copies/g dry weight sediment) varied spatiotemporally independently of environmental factors. AOA surpassed AOB in most samples, driven by sediment temperature, moisture, and total nitrogen. The diversity of both AOA and AOB differed spatiotemporally. The Nitrosopumilus and Nitrosospira clusters accounted for an absolutely dominant percentage of AOA (> 99%) and AOB (> 99%) respectively, indicating a negligible contribution of other clusters to ammonia oxidation. However, there was no significant correlation between nitrification potential and the abundance of AOA or AOB. Overall, the present study showed that AOA dominated over AOB spatiotemporally in the intertidal zone of Zhoushan Islands due to fluctuations in environmental factors, and the Nitrosopumilus and Nitrosospira clusters ecologically succeeded in the intertidal zone of Zhoushan Islands.","2019",NA,"10.1007/s00248-019-01359-x","WOS:000485929400002"

However, a good understanding of the structural composition of the bacterial and fungal microbiome present in different plant tissues and growing environments, especially in transgenic woody plants, is required. In the present study, we hypothesized that environmental conditions, ecological niches, and transgenic events could influence the community structure of plant-associated microorganisms (bacterial and fungal endophytes). We sampled the root and stem endospheres of field-grown transgenic and non-transgenic poplar trees (Populus alba x P. berolinensis) and applied 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer amplicon Illumina MiSeq sequencing to determine the bacterial and fungal communities associated with the different plant habitats and tissues. We found that actinobacteria, proteobacteria, bacteroidetes, and firmicutes were the dominant endophytic bacteria, and the fungal community was dominated by dothideomycetes, agaricomycetes, leotiomycetes, and sordariomycetes. In conclusion, transgenic events did not affect the endophytic bacterial and fungal diversity of poplar trees. The bacterial and fungal community structure depends on the pH and the soil organic matter content. Each plant tissue represents a unique ecological niche for the microbial communities.

Methanotrophs found in extremely acidic geothermal systems belong to the phylum Verrucomicrobia. Thermophilic verrucomicrobial methanotrophs from the genus Methylacidiphilum can grow autotrophically on hydrogen gas (H-2), but it is unknown whether this also holds for their mesophilic counterparts from the genus Methylacidimicrobium. To determine this, we examined H-2 consumption and CO2 fixation by the mesophilic verrucomicrobial methanotroph Methylacidimicrobium tartarophylax 4AC. We found that strain 4AC grows autotrophically on H-2 with a maximum growth rate of 0.0048 h(-1) and a yield of 2.1 g dry weight . mol H-2(-1), which is about 12 and 41% compared to the growth rate and yield on methane, respectively. The genome of strain 4AC only encodes for an oxygen-sensitive group 1b [NiFe] hydrogenase and H2 is respired only when oxygen concentrations are below 40 mu M. Phylogenetic analysis and genomic comparison of methanotrophs revealed diverse [NiFe] hydrogenases, presumably with varying oxygen sensitivity and affinity for H-2, which could drive niche differentiation. Our results show that both thermophilic and mesophilic verrucomicrobial methanotrophs can grow as autotrophs on H-2 as a sole energy source. Our results suggest that verrucomicrobial methanotrophs are particularly well-equipped to thrive in hostile volcanic ecosystems, since they can consume H-2 as additional energy source.","2019",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2019.02352","WOS:000491990000001"

These blooms contaminate shellfish with lipophilic toxins and cause lengthy harvesting bans. They are often followed by short-lived blooms of Dinophysis acuta, associated with northward longshore transport, at the end of the upwelling season. During the summers of 1989 and 1990, dense blooms of D. acuta developed in situ, initially co-occurring with D.acuminata and later with the paralytic shellfish toxin-producer Gymnodiniumcatenatum. Unexplored data from three cruises carried out before, during, and following autumn blooms (13-14, 27-28 September and 11-12 October) in 1990 showed D. acuta distribution in shelf waters within the 50 m and 130 m isobaths, delimited by the upwelling front. A joint review of monitoring data from Galicia and Portugal provided a mesoscale view of anomalies in SST and other hydroclimatic factors associated with a northward displacement of the center of gravity of D. acuta populations. At the microscale, re-examination of the vertical segregation of cell maxima in the light of current knowledge, improved our understanding of niche differentiation between the two species of Dinophysis.

However, the widely used molecular approaches are deficient or cost-inefficient in providing a comprehensive and quantitative population-level profile for Accumulibacter in complex community. In this study, we introduced a pipeline to analyze the population-level diversity and dynamics of Accumulibacter via high throughput sequencing (HTS) of ppk1 and 16S rRNA gene simultaneously. The HTS approach was assessed by testing primer coverage, performing sample replication, and comparing with a traditional clone library. Based on survey on full-scale activated sludge samples, unexpected high microdiversity in Accumulibacter and a tendency of exclusivity between two phylogenetic types were discovered. Moreover, the pipeline facilitated monitoring the population-level dynamics and co-occurrence pattern under various laboratory enriching conditions. The results revealed previously uncharacterized intraclade dynamics during enrichment, little effect of denitrifying process on the Accumulibacter diversity, and the niche adaption of Clade IIC on propionate as sole carbon source. Co-occurrence of Accumulibacter populations further partially supported the exclusivity of two types. A few bacterial taxa, including Cytophagaceae-, Prosthecobacter-, and Compteibacter-related taxa, showed co-occurrence with many Accumulibacter populations, suggesting their niche co-selection or potential metabolic interactions with Accumulibacter.

For coarse zooplankton groups latitude explained the main between-site differences, and meroplankton contributed more than holoplankton. Latitudinal differences were best indicated by contrasting abundances of cirripede larvae and doliolids (most abundant at the lowest latitude sites) and bryozoan and polychaete larvae (most abundant at the highest latitude site). Doliolids were best indicators of temperature-mediated latitudinal differences. The interaction between latitude and distance offshore or salinity and phytoplankton biomass explained smaller percentages of the variability. The main differences in copepod and cladoceran genera reflected the oceanic influence, with highest presence of Corycaeus and Oncaea at L4, likely related to the higher influence of off-shelf water intrusions, and neritic Acartia dominating at SH, U35 and B35. Podon and Evadne, which decreased from south to north, reflected latitude-related differences driven more by salinity than by temperature.

Rice fields, abundant with Euryarchaeota, had higher archaeal diversity and steeper distance-decay slopes than maize fields dominated by Thaumarchaeota. Dominant soil archaea showed distinct continental atlases and niche differentiation between dryland and wetland habitats, where they were associated with soil pH and mean annual temperature, respectively. After identifying their environmental preferences, we grouped the dominant archaeal taxa into different ecological clusters and determined the unique co-occurrence patterns within each cluster. Using this empirical dataset, we built a continental atlas of soil archaeal communities to provide reliable estimates of their spatial distributions in agricultural ecosystems.ConclusionsEnvironmental filtering plays a crucial role in driving the distinct continental atlases of dominant soil archaeal communities between dryland and wetland, with contrasting strategies of archaeal-driven nutrient cycling within these two agricultural ecosystems.

Pathogens are presumed to originate from the nasopharyngeal ecosystem. Objectives: To investigate the association between early life respiratory microbiota and development of childhood RTIs. Methods: In a prospective birth cohort (Microbiome Utrecht Infant Study: MUIS), we characterized the oral microbiota longitudinally from birth until 6 months of age of 112 infants (nine regular samples/subject) and compared them with nasopharyngeal microbiota using 16S-rRNA-based sequencing. We also characterized oral and nasopharynx samples during RTI episodes in the first half year of life. Measurements and Main Results: Oral microbiota were driven mostly by feeding type, followed by age, mode of delivery, and season of sampling. In contrast to our previously published associations between nasopharyngeal microbiota development and susceptibility to RTIs, oral microbiota development was not directly associated with susceptibility to RTI development. However, we did observe an influx of oral taxa, such as Neisseria lactamica, Streptococcus, Prevotella nanceiensis, Fusobacterium, and Janthinobacterium lividum, in the nasopharyngeal microbiota before and during RTIs, which was accompanied by reduced presence and abundance of Corynebacterium, Dolosigranulum, and Moraxella spp. Moreover, this phenomenon was accompanied by reduced niche differentiation indicating loss of ecological topography preceding confirmed RTIs. This loss of ecological topography was further augmented by start of daycare, and linked to consecutive development of symptomatic infections. Conclusions: Together, our results link the loss of topography to subsequent development of RTI episodes. This may lead to new insights for prevention of RTIs and antibiotic use in childhood.","2019",NA,"10.1164/rccm.201810-1993OC","WOS:000487682300021"

Trees shape their surrounding by both leaf litter and roots generating small scale heterogeneity and potentially governing community patterns of soil organisms. To assess the role of vegetation for the soil fauna, we studied whether tree species (Fagus sylvatica L., Acer pseudoplatanus L., Fraxinus excelsior L., Tilia cordata Mill.), markedly differing in leaf litter quality and root associated mycorrhizal symbionts, affect oribatid mite communities by shaping below- and aboveground resources and habitat complexity and availability. Oribatid mite abundance, species richness, community structure and the proportion of litter living and parthenogenetic individuals were analyzed and related to microbial biomass and the amount of remaining litter mass. Although leaf litter species with higher nutritional values decomposed considerably faster, microbial biomass only slightly differed between leaf litter species. Neither root species nor leaf litter species affected abundance, species richness or community structure of oribatid mites. However, root species had an effect on the proportion of parthenogenetic individuals with increased proportions in the presence of beech roots. Overall, the results suggest that identity and diversity of vegetation via leaf litter or roots are of minor importance for structuring oribatid mite communities of a temperate forest ecosystem.","2019",NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0219166","WOS:000484947800054"

All microbial community structures, i.e. for bacteria, archaea, and fungi, were significantly distinguished according to habitat.

Estuarine and coastal regimes are the major zones of N2O production in the marine system. However, knowledge on biological sources of N2O in estuarine ecosystems remains controversial but is of great importance for understanding global N2O emission patterns. Here, we measured concentrations and isotopic compositions of N2O as well as distributions of ammonia-oxidizing bacterial and archaeal amo Lambda and denitrifier nirS genes by quantitative polymerase chain reaction along a salinity gradient in the Pearl River estuary, and we performed in situ incubation experiments to estimate N2O yields. Our results indicated that nitrification predominantly occurred, with significant N2O production during ammonia oxidation. In the hypoxic waters of the upper estuary, strong nitrification resulted in the observed maximum N2O and Delta N2Oexcess concentrations, although minor denitrification might be concurrent at the site with the lowest dissolved oxygen. Ammonia-oxidizing beta-proteobacteria (AOB) were significantly positively correlated with all N2O-related parameters, although their amoA gene abundances were distinctly lower than ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) throughout the estuary. Furthermore, the N2O production rate and the N2O yield normalized to amoA gene copies or transcripts estimated a higher relative contribution of AOB to the N2O production in the upper estuary. Taken together, the in situ incubation experiments, N2O isotopic composition and concentrations, and gene datasets suggested that the high concentration of N2O (oversaturated) is mainly produced from strong nitrification by the relatively high abundance of AOB in the upper reaches and is the major source of N2O emitted to the atmosphere in the Pearl River estuary.","2019",NA,"10.5194/bg-16-4765-2019","WOS:000503009600002"

This has been explained by greater sensitivity of AOA to ammonia concentration, which will increase in soil solution during drought, but an alternative, previously unexplored explanation, is greater sensitivity of AOA to matric and/or osmotic stress. A soil microcosm experiment was designed to distinguish these different explanations in which AOA and AOB abundances (amoA abundance) and nitrification rate were measured over 28 days in nine treatments corresponding to all combinations of three soil matric potentials and three initial ammonia concentrations. Comparison of amoA abundance dynamics suggested that AOA were more susceptible to reduced matric potential than AOB, irrespective of soil ammonia concentration. The greater sensitivity of soil AOA to osmotic stress was also tested in 10-day cultures of representative strains of AOA and AOB in liquid medium containing different concentrations of NaCl and sorbitol as osmo-inducer.

Despite the evident changes above ground, the effect of rainforest conversion on the channeling of energy in soil food webs was not studied. Here, we investigated community-level neutral lipid fatty acid profiles in dominant soil fauna to track energy channels in rainforest, rubber, and oil palm plantations in Sumatra, Indonesia. Abundant macrofauna including Araneae, Chilopoda, and Diplopoda contained high amounts of plant and fungal biomarker fatty acids (FAs). Lumbricina had the lowest amount of plant, but the highest amount of animal-synthesized C20 poly-unsaturated FAs as compared to other soil taxa. Mesofauna detritivores (Collembola and Oribatida) contained high amounts of algal biomarker FAs. The differences in FA profiles between taxa were evident if data were analyzed across land-use systems, suggesting that soil fauna of different size (macro-and mesofauna) are associated with different energy channels. Despite that, rainforest conversion changed the biomarker FA composition of soil fauna at the community level. Conversion of rainforest into oil palm plantations enhanced the plant energy channel in soil food webs and reduced the bacterial energy channel; conversion into rubber plantations reduced the AMF-based energy channel. The changes in energy distribution within soil food webs may have significant implications for the functioning of tropical ecosystems and their response to environmental changes. At present, these responses are hard to predict considering the poor knowledge on structure and functioning of tropical soil food webs.","2019",NA,"10.1002/ece3.5449","WOS:000483220000011"

A fundamental physiological trait differentiating Nitrosomonas AOB is the adaptation to either low (cluster 6a) or high (cluster 7) ammonium concentrations. Here, we present physiological growth studies and genome analysis of Nitrosomonas cluster 6a and 7 AOB. Cluster 6a AOB displayed maximum growth rates at <= 1 mM ammonium, while cluster 7 AOB had maximum growth rates at >= 5 mM ammonium. In addition, cluster 7 AOB were more tolerant of high initial ammonium and nitrite concentrations than cluster 6a AOB. Cluster 6a AOB were completely inhibited by an initial nitrite concentration of 5 mM. Genomic comparisons were used to link genomic traits to observed physiological adaptations. Cluster 7 AOB encode a suite of genes related to nitrogen oxide detoxification and multiple terminal oxidases, which are absent in cluster 6a AOB. Cluster 6a AOB possess two distinct forms of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) and select species encode genes for hydrogen or urea utilization.

Clade IIIb bacteria are some of the most prominent members of freshwater environments, but little is known about their biology due to the lack of genome representatives. Only recently, the first non-marine isolate was cultured and described as Candidatus Fonsibacter ubiquis. Here, we expand the collection of freshwater IIIb representatives and describe a new IIIb species of the genus Ca. Fonsibacter. Specifically, we assembled a collection of 67 freshwater metagenomic datasets from the interconnected lakes of the Chattahoochee River basin (GA, USA) and obtained nearly complete metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) representing 5 distinct IIIb subclades, roughly equivalent to species based on genomic standards, including the previously described Ca. F. ubiquis. Genomic comparisons between members of the IIIb species revealed high similarity in gene content. However, when comparing their abundance profiles in the Chattahoochee basin and various aquatic environments, differences in temporal and spatial distributions among the distinct species were observed implying niche differentiation might be underlying the coexistence of the highly functionally similar representatives. The name Ca. Fonsibacter lacus sp. nov. is proposed for the most abundant and widespread species in the Chattahoochee River basin and various freshwater ecosystems. (C) 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

One of the major causes of this imbalance is our inadequate understanding of the diversity and distribution of marine N-2 fixers (diazotrophs) as well as their contribution to N-2 fixation. Here, we performed a large-scale cross-system study spanning the South China Sea, Luzon Strait, Philippine Sea, and western tropical Pacific Ocean to compare the biogeography of seven major diazotrophic groups and N-2 fixation rates in these ecosystems. Distinct spatial niche differentiation was observed. Trichodesmium was dominant in the South China Sea and western equatorial Pacific, whereas the unicellular cyanobacterium UCYN-B dominated in the Philippine Sea. Furthermore, contrasting diel patterns of Trichodesmium nifH genes and UCYN-B nifH gene transcript activity were observed. The heterotrophic diazotroph Gamma A phylotype was widespread throughout the western Pacific Ocean and occupied an ecological niche that overlapped with that of UCYN-B. Moreover, Gamma A (or other possible unknown/undetected diazotrophs) rather than Trichodesmium and UCYN-B may have been responsible for the high N-2 fixation rates in some samples. Regional biogeochemistry analyses revealed cross-system variations in N-2-fixing community composition and activity constrained by sea surface temperature, aerosol optical thickness, current velocity, mixed-layer depth, and chlorophyll a concentration. These factors except for temperature essentially control/reflected iron supply/bioavailability and thus drive diazotroph biogeography.

"Norton, J; Ouyang, Y","Controls and Adaptive Management of Nitrification in Agricultural Soils","FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY","Agriculture is responsible for over half of the input of reactive nitrogen (N) to terrestrial systems; however improving N availability remains the primary management technique to increase crop yields in most regions. In the majority of agricultural soils, ammonium is rapidly converted to nitrate by nitrification, which increases the mobility of N through the soil matrix, strongly influencing N retention in the system. Decreasing nitrification through management is desirable to decrease N losses and increase N fertilizer use efficiency. We review the controlling factors on the rate and extent of nitrification in agricultural soils from temperate regions including substrate supply, environmental conditions, abundance and diversity of nitrifiers and plant and microbial interactions with nitrifiers. Approaches to the management of nitrification include those that control ammonium substrate availability and those that inhibit nitrifiers directly. Strategies for controlling ammonium substrate availability include timing of fertilization to coincide with rapid plant update, formulation of fertilizers for slow release or with inhibitors, keeping plant growing continuously to assimilate N, and intensify internal N cycling (immobilization). Another effective strategy is to inhibit nitrifiers directly with either synthetic or biological nitrification inhibitors. Commercial nitrification inhibitors are effective but their use is complicated by a changing climate and by organic management requirements. The interactions of the nitrifying organisms with plants or microbes producing biological nitrification inhibitors is a promising approach but just beginning to be critically examined. Climate smart agriculture will need to carefully consider optimized seasonal timing for these strategies to remain effective management tools.","2019",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2019.01931","WOS:000483318100001"

Methanotrophs represent a widespread and phylogenetically complex guild, yet the biogeography of this functional group and the factors that explain the taxonomic structure of the methanotrophic assemblage are still poorly understood. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene of the bacterial community to study the methanotrophic community composition and the environmental factors that influence their distribution and relative abundance in a wide range of freshwater habitats, including lakes, streams and rivers across the boreal landscape. Within one region, soil and soil water samples were additionally taken from the surrounding watersheds in order to cover the full terrestrial-aquatic continuum. The composition of methanotrophic communities across the boreal landscape showed only a modest degree of regional differentiation but a strong structuring along the hydrologic continuum from soil to lake communities, regardless of regions. This pattern along the hydrologic continuum was mostly explained by a clear niche differentiation between type I and type II methanotrophs along environmental gradients in pH, and methane concentrations. Our results suggest very different roles of type I and type II methanotrophs within inland waters, the latter likely having a terrestrial source and reflecting passive transport and dilution along the aquatic networks, but this is an unresolved issue that requires further investigation.","2019","SEP 2019","10.1111/mec.15223","WOS:000487461200001"

The resulting increase in system complexity is likely to affect soil-N cycling by altering soil microbial community structure and functions. Our study aimed to assess the abundance of genes encoding enzymes involved in soil-N cycling in paired monoculture and agroforestry cropland in a Phaeozem soil, and paired open grassland and agroforestry grassland in Histosol and Anthrosol soils. The soil fungi-to-bacteria ratio was greater in the tree row than in the crop or grass rows of the monoculture cropland and open grassland in all soil types, possibly due to increased input of tree residues and the absence of tillage in the Phaeozem (cropland) soil. In the Phaeozem (cropland) soil, gene abundances of amoA indicated a niche differentiation between archaeal and bacterial ammonia oxidizers that distinctly separated the influence of the tree row from the crop row and monoculture system. Abundances of nitrate (napA and narG), nitrite (nirK and nirS) and nitrous oxide reductase genes (nosZ clade I) were largely influenced by soil type rather than management system. The soil types' effects were associated with their differences in soil organic C, total N and pH.

"Jones, CM; Hallin, S","Geospatial variation in co-occurrence networks of nitrifying microbial guilds","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","Microbial communities transform nitrogen (N) compounds, thereby regulating the availability of N in soil. The N cycle is defined by interacting microbial functional groups, as inorganic N-products formed in one process are the substrate in one or several other processes. The nitrification pathway is often a two-step process in which bacterial or archaeal communities oxidize ammonia to nitrite, and bacterial communities further oxidize nitrite to nitrate. Little is known about the significance of interactions between ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) and nitrite-oxidizing bacterial communities (NOB) in determining the spatial variation of overall nitrifier community structure. We hypothesize that non-random associations exist between different AO and NOB lineages that, along with edaphic factors, shape field-scale spatial patterns of nitrifying communities. To address this, we sequenced and quantified the abundance of AOA, AOB, and Nitrospira and Nitrobacter NOB communities across a 44-hectare site with agricultural fields. The abundance of Nitrobacter communities was significantly associated only with AOB abundance, while that of Nitrospira was correlated to AOA. Network analysis and geostatistical modelling revealed distinct modules of co-occurring AO and NOB groups occupying disparate areas, with each module dominated by different lineages and associated with different edaphic factors. Local communities were characterized by a high proportion of module-connecting versus module-hub nodes, indicating that nitrifier assemblages in these soils are shaped by fluctuating conditions. Overall, our results demonstrate the utility of network analysis in accounting for potential biotic interactions that define the niche space of nitrifying communities at scales compatible to soil management.","2019",NA,"10.1111/mec.14893","WOS:000459345000011"

Here we provide quantitative data using a sensitive stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry procedure with microcosms on species interactions in the fungal pathway. We measured N-15 and C-13 enrichment in microarthropods through grazing rare isotope enriched fungal mycelia. Experimental treatments were various combinations of 1, 2, 3, 4 microarthropods species. We used three fungivores (the collembolan Lepidocyrtus curvicollis, the Astigmata Tyrophagus putrescentiae, the Oribatida Oribatula tibialis), and the Mesostigmata predator Hypoaspis acquilifer. We collected individuals of each species separately, as well as their feces, and molt where available. All three fungivorous microarthropods consumed significantly more than their own body weight per day. The three fungivores differed in their consumption of the mycelium as it was not equally palatable to each. The Mesostigmata predator Hypoaspis also differed in its microarthropod prey preference. In multiple species combinations microarthropod behavioral interactions modified consumption and predation rates. Our selection of mites of different sizes, with varied preference for the mycelium, combined with differing predation rates on each mite, demonstrate that even three trophic level interactions with only five interacting species are not predictably simple. The interpretation of the stable isotope results and consumed-excreted weights indicate that: (a) behavior and microscopic observations should not be ignored in competition-predation interactions, and (b) functional guilds can take advantage of more diverse food opportunities. The reality of mixed diets complicates functional guild assignments that are reflected in N-15 and C-13 isotope levels at natural abundances in the environment.

Differences in the clearance rate (CR; water volume cleared of material per mussel and time) based on changes in chlorophyll a concentration were observed among species (P. alatus > Q. quadrula). Mussels had higher CR under flowing conditions and higher CR were observed on four of the nine algal taxa under flowing conditions. Feeding electivity analysis indicated that all mussel species selected for larger particles (28-35 mu m size fraction) while rejecting smaller ones (12-19 mu m). Whereas mussels did not appear to partition resources by size, mussel species exhibited resource partitioning of algal taxa (i.e., selectively feeding on different algal species; under flowing conditions: small centric diatoms were preferred by P. fasciolaris and Q. quadrula and avoided by P. alatus; Cryptomonas were preferred by P. fasciolaris and avoided by Q. quadrula and P. alatus; Chloromonas were preferred by P. alatus and avoided by P. fasciolaris). This study provides a novel mechanism, hydrodynamically mediated resource partitioning, in which the partitioning of resources occurs from with in a flowing fluid rather than through the spatial or temporal partitioning of resources by organisms exploiting different microhabitats, to explain the existence of high mussel species richness within the same river reach (i.e., 24 species in this study).

"Dumbrell, AJ","Size matters in regulating the biodiversity of tropical forest soils","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","Tropical forests have long fascinated ecologists, inspiring a plethora of research into the mechanisms regulating their immense biodiversity, which originally captured the interests of early natural historians and explorers, and that still persists to this day. A new focus of this research emerged in the early 2000s highlighting the potential role of neutral (stochastic) processes in regulating the composition and diversity of tropical forest communities, and thus the maintenance of a large portion of global biodiversity (Hubbell, ). This strictly contrasted the long-held belief that communities assembled via the sorting of species (and their abundances) via a deterministic response to local abiotic and biotic environmental conditions, reflecting the niche of each species (Leibold & McPeek, ). Yet, it is unlikely that the assembly of any community is solely governed by either stochastic or deterministic processes, but instead a combination of both. However, whether deterministic processes via niche-based environmental sorting of species, or stochastic processes reflecting pattens of dispersal limitation, neutral effects and ecological drift dominate is often unclear. This prompts questions as to whether the relative influence of one process over another is dependent on the scale (spatial or temporal) or context of the study, or specific traits of the taxa under investigation (e.g., body size). In a From the Cover paper in this issue of Molecular Ecology, Zinger et al. (2018) tackle all these issues and show, among other things, that for soil microbes and mesofauna from tropical forests, the relative contribution of stochastic and deterministic processes in assembling their communities is strongly dependent on the body size or the studied taxa.","2019",NA,"10.1111/mec.14996","WOS:000459485200002"

It is common for two or more invasive plant species to co-occur in invaded ecosystems. This study aimed to determine the effects of co-invasion of two invasive species (Erigeron annuus and Solidago canadensis) with different cover classes on soil fungal communities using high-throughput sequencing. Invasion of E.annuus and/or S.canadensis had positive effects on the sequence number, operational taxonomic unit (OTU) richness, Shannon diversity, abundance-based cover estimator (ACE index) and Chao1 index of soil fungal communities, but negative effects on the Simpson index. Thus, invasion of E.annuus and/or S.canadensis could increase diversity and richness of soil fungal communities but decrease dominance of some members of these communities, in part to facilitate plant further invasion, because high soil microbial diversity could increase soil functions and plant nutrient acquisition. Some soil fungal species grow well, whereas others tend to extinction after non-native plant invasion with increasing invasion degree and presumably time. The sequence number, OTU richness, Shannon diversity, ACE index and Chao1 index of soil fungal communities were higher under co-invasion of E.annuus and S.canadensis than under independent invasion of either individual species. The co-invasion of the two invasive species had a positive synergistic effect on diversity and abundance of soil fungal communities, partly to build a soil microenvironment to enhance competitiveness of the invaders. The changed diversity and community under co-invasion could modify resource availability and niche differentiation within the soil fungal communities, mediated by differences in leaf litter quality and quantity, which can support different fungal/microbial species in the soil.","2018",NA,"10.1111/plb.12646","WOS:000417938000017"

These signals are especially pronounced in the Prairie Pothole Region of North America, the tenth largest wetland ecosystem in the world. Sulfate reduction rates up to 22 mu mol cm(-3) day(-1) have been measured in these wetland sediments, as well as methane fluxes up to 160 mg m(-2) h(-1)-some of the highest emissions ever measured in North American wetlands. While pore waters from PPR wetlands are characterized by high concentrations of sulfur species and dissolved organic carbon, the constraints on microbial activity are poorly understood. Here, we utilized metagenomics to investigate candidate sulfate reducers and methanogens in this ecosystem and identify metabolic and viral controls on microbial activity. Results: We recovered 162 dsrA and 206 dsrD sequences from 18 sediment metagenomes and reconstructed 24 candidate sulfate reducer genomes assigned to seven phyla. These genomes encoded the potential for utilizing a wide variety of electron donors, such as methanol and other alcohols, methylamines, and glycine betaine. We also identified 37 mcrA sequences spanning five orders and recovered two putative methanogen genomes representing the most abundant taxa-Methanosaeta and Methanoregulaceae. However, given the abundance of Methanofollis affiliated mcrA sequences, the detection of F420-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases, and millimolar concentrations of ethanol and 2-propanol in sediment pore fluids, we hypothesize that these alcohols may drive a significant fraction of methanogenesis in this ecosystem. Finally, extensive viral novelty was detected, with approximately 80% of viral populations being unclassified at any known taxonomic levels and absent from publicly available databases. Many of these viral populations were predicted to target dominant sulfate reducers and methanogens. Conclusions: Our results indicate that diversity is likely key to extremely high rates of methanogenesis and sulfate reduction observed in these wetlands. The inferred genomic diversity and metabolic versatility could result from dynamic environmental conditions, viral infections, and niche differentiation in the heterogeneous sediment matrix. These processes likely play an important role in modulating carbon and sulfur cycling in this ecosystem.","2018",NA,"10.1186/s40168-018-0522-4","WOS:000442017000001"

The Loess Plateau in northwest China is characterized with deep soils that are often exposed to the surface and reactive nitrogen (N) inputs due to erosion and human removal of the surface soil. However, few have examined the distribution of AOA and AOB along the profile of Loess Plateau soils and their responses to N inputs. We examined the abundance and diversity of AOA and AOB along the soil profile (0-100 cm) and their responses to two levels of N inputs (low at 10, and high at 100 mu g N g(-1) soil) in a 55-d incubation experiment. While AOB were most numerous in the surface soil (0-20 cm), AOA were most abundant in the subsoils (20-40 and 40-60 cm), suggesting a niche differentiation between AOA and AOB along the soil profile. High N input increased AOB nearly ten-fold in the upper two layers of soils (0-20 and 20-40 cm) and sixteen to twenty-five fold in the deeper soil layers (40-60, 60-80 and 80-100 cm). However, it only increased AOA by 7% (40-60 cm) to 48% (20-40 cm). In addition, potential nitrification rate and N2O emissions correlated only with AOB. Finally, high N input significantly increased AOB diversity and led to nitrite accumulation in deep soil layers (60-80 and 80-100 cm). Together, our results showed that high N input can significantly alter the diversity and function of ammonia-oxidizing microbes in the deep soil of Loess Plateau, suggesting the need to examine the generality of the observed changes and their potential environmental impacts.

Previous surveys in western Africa indicated the presence of two biotypes of the invasive MED species (MED-Q1 and MED-Q3) living in sympatry with the African species SSA and ASL. This situation constitutes one of the rare cases of local coexistence of various genetic entities within the B.tabaci complex. In order to study the dynamics of the distribution and abundance of genetic entities within this community and to identify potential factors that could contribute to coexistence, we sampled B.tabaci populations in Burkina Faso in 2015 and 2016 on various plants, and also their parasitoids. All four genetic entities were still recorded, indicating no exclusion of local species by the MED species. While B.tabaci individuals were found on 55 plant species belonging to eighteen (18) families showing the high polyphagy of this pest, some species/biotypes exhibited higher specificity. Two parasitoid species (Eretmocerus mundus and Encarsia vandrieschei) were also recorded with E.mundus being predominant in most localities and on most plants. Our data indicated that whitefly abundance, diversity, and rate of parasitism varied according to areas, plants, and years, but that parasitism rate was globally highly correlated with whitefly abundance suggesting density dependence. Our results also suggest dynamic variation in the local diversity of B.tabaci species/biotypes from 1year to the other, specifically with MED-Q1 and ASL species. This work provides relevant information on the nature of plant-B.tabaci-parasitoid interactions in West Africa and identifies that coexistence might be stabilized by niche differentiation for some genetic entities.

Our results showed that the addition of M and NPK significantly decreased Nitrobacter Shannon and Chao1 index, while M and MNPK remarkably increased Nitrospira Shannon and Chao1 index, and NPK considerably decreased Nitrospira Shannon and Chao1 index, with the greatest diversity achieved in soils amended with MNPK. However, the soil aggregate fractions had no impact on that alpha-diversity of Nitrobacter and Nitrospira under the fertilizer treatment. Soil carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in the soil had a significant correlation with Nitrospira Shannon and Chao1 diversity index, while total potassium only had a significant correlation with Nitrospira Shannon diversity index. However, all of them had no significant correlation with Nitrobacter Shannon and Chao1 diversity index. The resistance indices for alpha-diversity indexes (Shannon and Chao1) of Nitrobacter were higher than those of Nitrospira in response to the fertilization regimes. Manure fertilizer is important in enhancing the Nitrospira Shannon and Chao1 index resistance. Principal co-ordinate analysis revealed that Nitrobacter- and Nitrospira-like NOB communities under four fertilizer regimes were differentiated from each other, but soil aggregate fractions had less effect on the nitrite oxidizers community. Redundancy analysis and Mantel test indicated that soil nitrogen, carbon, phosphorus, and available potassium content were important environmental attributes that control the Nitrobacter- and Nitrospira-like NOB community structure across different fertilization treatments under aggregate levels in the red soil. In general, nitrite-oxidizing bacteria community composition and alpha-diversity are depending on fertilizer regimes, but independent of the soil aggregate.","2018",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2018.00885","WOS:000431655400001"

Therefore, knowing whether and how plant species adopt different N acquisition strategies during the winter-spring transitional period is essential for understanding ecosystem functioning in temperate grasslands. In this study, parallel experiments with N-15 tracer were conducted to examine plant N acquisition strategies during winter-spring transition in a meadow and a typical steppe in northern China. We found that soil microbes immobilized 20% of the N-15 tracer during the spring thawing period at both sites, and then released half of it back to the soil before late spring, confirming that soil microbes competed effectively with the plant roots for mineral N in early spring. Perennial bunch grasses adopted an active N acquisition strategy at the beginning of the spring thawing period. In contrast, perennial forbs and rhizome grasses began to take up N in the middle of the spring thawing period, and they acquired more N than the bunch grasses. However, sagebrushes and legumes accounted for little N-15 recovery, indicating their dependence on internal N accumulation or N fixation. At the ecosystem level, no significant difference in the magnitude of plant N-15 uptake was observed between the meadow steppe and typical steppe, although the plant biomass N in the meadow steppe was twice that of the typical steppe during the thawing period. This was attributed to the higher soil inorganic N and faster net N mineralization rate in the meadow steppe than in the typical steppe. Our results suggest that temporal niche differentiation in N acquisition during early spring may facilitate species coexistence in temperate grasslands despite strong plant-microbe or plant-plant competition for N.

The majority of phyllosphere endophytes originate from the soil and migrate up to the aerial compartments through the root endosphere. Thus, the soil and root endosphere partially define the aerial endosphere in the leaves and berries, contributing to the terroir of the fruit. However, V. vinifera cultivars are invariably grafted onto the rootstocks of other Vitis species and hybrids. It has been hypothesized that the plant species determines the microbiome of the root endosphere and, as a consequence, the aerial endosphere. In this work, we test the first part of this hypothesis. We investigate whether different rootstocks influence the bacteria selected from the surrounding soil, affecting the bacterial diversity and potential functionality of the rhizosphere and root endosphere. Methods: Bacterial microbiomes from both the root tissues and the rhizosphere of Barbera cultivars, both ungrafted and grafted on four different rootstocks, cultivated in the same soil from the same vineyard, were characterized by 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing. To assess the influence of the root genotype on the bacterial communities' recruitment in the root system, (i) the phylogenetic diversity coupled with the predicted functional profiles and (ii) the co-occurrence bacterial networks were determined. Cultivation-dependent approaches were used to reveal the plant-growth promoting (PGP) potential associated with the grafted and ungrafted root systems. Results: Richness, diversity and bacterial community networking in the root compartments were significantly influenced by the rootstocks. Complementary to a shared bacterial microbiome, different subsets of soil bacteria, including those endowed with PGP traits, were selected by the root system compartments of different rootstocks. The interaction between the root compartments and the rootstock exerted a unique selective pressure that enhanced niche differentiation, but rootstock-specific bacterial communities were still recruited with conserved PGP traits. Conclusion: While the rootstock significantly influences the taxonomy, structure and network properties of the bacterial community in grapevine roots, a homeostatic effect on the distribution of the predicted and potential functional PGP traits was found.","2018",NA,"10.1186/s40168-017-0391-2","WOS:000419158300002"

In Germany, where this species was recently introduced, its establishment may become modulated by interspecific competition from autochthonous mosquito species, especially Culex pipiens (s.l.). While competitive superiority of Ae. albopictus to Cx. pipiens (s.l.) has been described elsewhere, it has not been assessed in the epidemiological conditions of Germany. The present study aimed to determine if such superiority exists under the physicochemical and microclimatic conditions typical for container habitats in Germany. Methods: In a replacement series experiment, the larval and pupal responses of Ae. albopictus and Cx. pipiens (s.l.) (mortality, development time, growth) to interspecific interaction (five larval ratios) at (sub-) optimal temperatures (15, 20 and 25 degrees C) and differing food supply (3 and 6 mg animal-based food larva(-1)) were investigated using a randomized split-plot design. In addition to physicochemical measurements of the test media, natural physicochemical conditions were determined for comparative analyses in mosquito breeding sites across the Rhine-Main metropolitan region of Germany. Results: Under the physicochemical and microclimatic conditions similar to the breeding sites of the Rhine-Main region, competitive superiority of Cx. pipiens (s.l.) to Ae. albopictus in terms of larval survival was more frequently observed than balanced coexistence. Food regime and multifactorial interactions, but not temperature alone, were controlling factors for interspecific competition. Larval food regime and the larval ratio of Ae. albopictus influenced the physicochemistry and algal growth at 15 degrees C, with increased Ae. albopictus mortality linked to a decreasing number of Scenedesmus, Oocystis and Anabaena algae. Conclusions: Under the present environmental conditions, the spread of Ae. albopictus from isolated foci in Germany may generally be slowed by biotic interactions with the ubiquitous Cx. pipiens (s.l.) (and potentially other container-breeding mosquito species) and by limnic microalgae in microhabitats with high resource levels. Detailed knowledge of the context dependency in temperate mosquito ecology, and interrelations of physicochemistry and phycology may help to achieve a better understanding of the upcoming Ae. albopictus colonization processes in central and northern Europe.","2018",NA,"10.1186/s13071-018-2665-3","WOS:000424154800002"
"Anderson, KE; Ricigliano, VA; Mott, BM; Copeland, DC; Floyd, AS; Maes, P","The queen's gut refines with age: longevity phenotypes in a social insect model","MICROBIOME","Background: In social insects, identical genotypes can show extreme lifespan variation providing a unique perspective on age-associated microbial succession. In honey bees, short- and long-lived host phenotypes are polarized by a suite of age-associated factors including hormones, nutrition, immune senescence, and oxidative stress. Similar to other model organisms, the aging gut microbiota of short-lived (worker) honey bees accrue Proteobacteria and are depleted of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, consistent with a suite of host senescence markers. In contrast, long-lived (queen) honey bees maintain youthful cellular function with much lower expression of oxidative stress genes, suggesting a very different host environment for age-associated microbial succession. Results: We sequenced the microbiota of 63 honey bee queens exploring two chronological ages and four alimentary tract niches. To control for genetic and environmental variation, we quantified carbonyl accumulation in queen fat body tissue as a proxy for biological aging. We compared our results to the age-specific microbial succession of worker guts. Accounting for queen source variation, two or more bacterial species per niche differed significantly by queen age. Biological aging in queens was correlated with microbiota composition highlighting the relationship of microbiota with oxidative stress. Queens and workers shared many major gut bacterial species, but differ markedly in community structure and age succession. In stark contrast to aging workers, carbonyl accumulation in queens was significantly associated with increased Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium and depletion of various Proteobacteria. Conclusions: We present a model system linking changes in gut microbiota to diet and longevity, two of the most confounding variables in human microbiota research. The pattern of age-associated succession in the queen microbiota is largely the reverse of that demonstrated for workers. The guts of short-lived worker phenotypes are progressively dominated by three major Proteobacteria, but these same species were sparse or significantly depleted in long-lived queen phenotypes. More broadly, age-related changes in the honey bee microbiota reflect the regulatory anatomy of reproductive host metabolism. Our synthesis suggests that the evolution of colony-level reproductive physiology formed the context for host-microbial interactions and age-related succession of honey bee microbiota.","2018",NA,"10.1186/s40168-018-0489-1","WOS:000435837300001"

Within marine phytoplankton, multidecadal time series of monoclonal strains germinated from resting stages have been established for diatoms (Skeletonema marinoi) and dinoflagellates (Pentapharsodinium dalei), spanning ca. a century. Phenotypic and genotypic analyses of these time series have revealed effects of past environmental changes on population genetic structure. Future perspectives include direct comparisons of phenotypes and genotypic data of populations, for example, by genomewide assays that can correlate phenotypic trends with genotypes and allele frequencies in temporally separated strains. Besides their usefulness as historical records, seed banks of phytoplankton resting stages also have the potential to provide an inoculum that influences present populations through dispersal from the past (the storage effect) and are important for adaptation to future environments through their standing genetic diversity.","2018",NA,"10.1111/eva.12513","WOS:000419064100002"

Thus, this study aimed to evaluate different pre- and postharvest strategies to extend the storage period of 'BRS Isis' seedless table grapes. The treatments consisted of grapes packed into carton boxes under cold storage (1 degrees C and high relative humidity), pre- and/or postharvest treatment with potassium bicarbonate or a biological control agent (Bacillus subtilis), all with Botrytis inoculation. Additionally, two controls, with and without Botrytis inoculation, were also evaluated. The experimental design was completely randomized with eight treatments and three replications, and each plot consisted of four bunches. After a 50-day cold storage period, the carton boxes were kept for five days at room temperature (22 degrees C). Gray mold incidence and water loss, as well as soluble solids (SS), pH, titratable acidity (TA), SS/TA ratio, and color attributes were evaluated during both periods. Cold storage effectively reduced gray mold in 'BRS Isis' seedless grape for a period of 50 days, even when grapes were inoculated; however, no difference among treatments was observed.

Sertaconazole nitrate (STZ), a novel broad spectrum antifungal drug, was suggested as a promising treatment. However, its utility in the ocular route is restricted by its poor solubility, along with other problems facing the ocular delivery like short residence time, and the existing corneal barrier. Therefore, the objective of this study was to formulate STZ loaded binary mixed micelles (STZ-MMs) enriched with different penetration enhancers using thin-film hydration method, based on a 3(1).2(2) mixed factorial design. Different formulation variables were examined, namely, type of auxiliary surfactant, type of penetration enhancer, and total surfactants: drug ratio, and their effects on the solubility of STZ in MMs (S-M), particle size (PS), polydispersity index (PDI), and zeta potential (ZP) were evaluated. STZ-MMs enhanced STZ aqueous solubility up to 338.82-fold compared to free STZ. Two optimized formulations (MM-8 and MM-11) based on the desirability factor (0.891 and 0.866) were selected by Design expert (R) software for further investigations. The optimized formulations were imaged by TEM which revealed nanosized spherical micelles. Moreover, they were examined for corneal mucoadhesion, stability upon dilution, storage effect, and ex vivo corneal permeation studies. Finally, both in vivo corneal uptake and in vivo corneal tolerance were investigated. MM-8 showed superiority in the ex vivo and in vivo permeation studies when compared to the STZ-suspension.

"Barraquand, F; Picoche, C; Maurer, D; Carassou, L; Auby, I","Coastal phytoplankton community dynamics and coexistence driven by intragroup density-dependence, light and hydrodynamics","OIKOS","Phytoplanktonic communities maintain a high diversity in a seemingly homogeneous environment, competing for the same set of resources. Many theories have been proposed to explain this coexistence despite likely competition, such as contrasted responses to temporal environmental variation. However, theory has developed at a faster pace than empirical evaluation using field data, which requires inferring drivers of community dynamics from observational time series. Here, we combine autoregressive models with a data set spanning more than 20 years of phytoplankton counts every two weeks, together with nutrients and physical variables. By comparing models dominated by nutrients or physical variables (hydrodynamics and climate), we first explore which abiotic factors contribute more to phytoplankton growth and decline. We find that physical drivers - such as irradiance, wind, and salinity - explain some of the variability in abundances unexplained by biotic interactions. In contrast, responses to nutrients explain less of the phytoplankton variability. Concerning biotic drivers of community dynamics, multivariate autoregressive models reveal that competition between different groups (genera) has a much weaker effect on population growth rates than competition within a group. In fact, the few biotic interactions between genera that are detected are frequently positive. Hence, our system is unlikely to be best represented as a set of competitors whose differing responses to fluctuating environments allow coexistence, as in 'paradox of the plankton' models with a storage effect or a relative nonlinearity of competition. Coexistence is more likely to result from high intragroup density-dependence. Competition between phytoplanktonic groups and nutrient limitation are often invoked as drivers of phytoplankton dynamics; our findings suggest instead that more attention should be given to the physical structure of the environment and natural enemies such as grazers and pathogens, that could explain the high intraspecific density dependence found here.","2018",NA,"10.1111/oik.05361","WOS:000451851200012"
"Parker, IM; Gilbert, GS","Density-dependent disease, life-history trade-offs, and the effect of leaf pathogens on a suite of co-occurring close relatives","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY","1. Plant pathogens reduce the performance of their hosts and therefore may contribute to ecological mechanisms of coexistence. In Chesson's framework, pathogens contribute to stabilizing mechanisms when they intensify negative intraspecific interactions, such as density-dependent disease. Additionally, pathogens contribute to equalizing mechanisms when they reduce differences in performance among species. Life-history trade-offs predict higher susceptibility to pathogens in rapidly growing species, which could equalize performance among fast- and slow-growing species in the presence of pathogens. 2. In a coastal prairie in California, we studied the impact of leaf diseases on the performance of 17 co-occurring species of Trifolium and Medicago (clovers). We transplanted clovers in randomized arrays into the natural prairie community in 3 years of common garden experiments. We quantified infection rates by isolating fungi from leaves, and we measured disease severity as per cent leaf area damaged. In a fungicide experiment, we measured the impact of infection on biomass and survival. We assessed whether disease on transplants was positively related to natural abundance of that species in the surrounding community, which we monitored over 5 years. We assessed life-history trade-offs by testing whether more rapidly growing species were more susceptible to pathogens. 3. Rank abundance of clover species was stable over 5 years despite marked environmental fluctuations. Across hosts, fungal infection was not linearly related to density, although transplants of species that were locally absent showed lower and more variable infection. Disease severity was greater for more abundant species, but in only 1 of 3 years, and response to fungicide was not stronger in more abundant species. As predicted by life-history trade-offs, faster-growing species experienced greater fungal infection. However, the impact of that infection was less negative, not more negative, on faster-growing species. 4. Our results suggest that life-history trade-offs in plant-pathogen interactions may influence equalizing mechanisms among species in this guild, but the combined effects of greater infection with greater tolerance may limit rather than promote coexistence. We also found modest evidence that density-dependent disease may contribute to stabilizing mechanisms. Lack of host specificity, rapid evolution of host use and temporal variation in climatic conditions may all influence the role that pathogens play in coexistence of these closely related plants.","2018",NA,"10.1111/1365-2745.13024","WOS:000452178600006"
"Zug, R; Hammerstein, P","Evolution of reproductive parasites with direct fitness benefits","HEREDITY","Maternally inherited symbionts such as Wolbachia have long been seen mainly as reproductive parasites, with deleterious effects on host fitness. It is becoming clear, however, that, frequently, these symbionts also have beneficial effects on host fitness, either along with reproductive parasitism or not. Using the examples of cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) and male-killing (MK), we here analyze the effect of direct fitness benefits on the evolution of reproductive parasites. By means of a simple theoretical framework, we synthesize and extend earlier modeling approaches for CI and MK, which usually ignore fitness benefits. Moreover, our framework is not restricted to a particular mechanism underlying the fitness benefit (e.g., protection against pathogens). We derive invasion conditions and equilibrium frequencies for the different infection scenarios. Our results demonstrate the importance of a symbiont's effective fecundity (i.e., the product of the relative fecundity of an infected female and her transmission efficiency) for a symbiont's invasion success. In particular, we adopt the concept of effective fecundity to scenarios where CI and MK co-occur in one host population. We confirm that direct fitness benefits substantially facilitate the invasion and spread of infections (for example, by lowering or removing the invasion threshold) or even make invasion possible in the first place (for example, if reproductive parasitism is weak or absent). Finally, we discuss the role of direct fitness benefits in long-term evolutionary dynamics of reproductive phenotypes and highlight their potential to resolve genetic conflicts between maternally inherited symbionts and their hosts.","2018",NA,"10.1038/s41437-017-0022-5","WOS:000426179000007"

Formin homology proteins (formins) play an essential role in the formation of actin stress fibers and yeast actin cables, to which the major actin depolymerizing factor cofilin barely associates. In vitro, Factin decorated with cofilin exhibits a marked increase in the filament twist. On the other hand, a mammalian formin mDia1 rotates along the long-pitch actin helix during processive actin elongation (helical rotation). Helical rotation may impose torsional force on Factin in the opposite direction of the cofilin-induced twisting. Here, we show that helical rotation of mDia1 converts F-actin resistant to cofilin both in vivo and in vitro. F-actin assembled by mDia1 without rotational freedom became more resistant to the severing and binding activities of cofilin than freely rotatable Factin. Electron micrographic analysis revealed untwisting of the long-pitch helix of F-actin elongating from mDia1 on tethering of both mDia1 and the pointed end side of the filament. In cells, single molecules of mDia1 Delta C63, an activated mutant containing N-terminal regulatory domains, showed tethering to cell structures more frequently than autoinhibited wild-type mDia1 and mDia1 devoid of N-terminal domains. Overexpression of mDia1 Delta C63 induced the formation of F-actin, which has prolonged lifetime and accelerates dissociation of cofilin. Helical rotation of formins may thus serve as an F-actin stabilizing mechanism by which a barbed end-bound molecule can enhance the stability of a filament over a long range.","2018",NA,"10.1073/pnas.1803415115","WOS:000433283700009"

We hypothesized that water flow negatively affects the FG-environment relationship because high flow promotes dispersal stochasticity. Our results indicated that the FG-environment relationship was affected mainly by the rainfall regime. Periods with intermediate precipitation showed greater predictability than periods with extreme precipitation. This suggests that the effect of stochastic processes on the phytoplankton community is more important in both the highest and lowest water flow, and deterministic processes are more important at intermediate flow. The longitudinal gradient of nutrients, light, and water-column mixing influenced the distribution of the FG biomass. The riverine zone showed high nutrient concentrations, low light availability, and a high biomass of organisms related to highly enriched systems (FG J-chlorophyceans) and shade-adapted taxa (FG S1-cyanobacteria). The lacustrine zone showed high light availability and a high biomass of heterocytous cyanobacteria (FGs S (N) and H1) and meroplanktonic diatoms (FG MP).

Here we describe the diet and feeding selectivity of two flamingo species, the Andean Flamingo Phoenicoparrus andinus and Chilean Flamingo Phoenicopterus chilensis, which coexist in a lowland area of Argentina. Environmental characteristics and available food resources were assessed at twelve lakes where feeding flocks of both species of flamingos occurred. Food items found in faeces (16S rRNA for bacteria and archaea) and microscopic analyses (for Cyanobacteria, microalgae and microinvertebrates) were analysed, and the birds' feeding selectivity and niche overlap were estimated. Results showed that the lakes were of eutrophic to hypereutrophic status, and with hypohaline to mesohaline salinity levels. Predominant microorganisms belonged to the Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, Chloroflexi, Euryarchaeota, Cyanobacteria, Bacillariophyta and Copepoda phyla. Euryarchaeota and Firmicutes were the main phyla found in the faeces, with Chloroflexi and Planctomycetes also present in smaller quantities. Proteobacteria were well represented in Andean Flamingo faeces, but Verrucomicrobia were scarce in both species. Cyanobacteria, Bacillariophyta, Diet and feeding selectivity of Chilean and Andean Flamingos Copepoda, Cladocera, and Rotifera were abundant in Chilean Flamingo faeces, and larger organisms belonging to Ostracoda, Nematoda, and Diptera were also found. The most consumed taxa were in the intermediate to large size range (10(4) to 2x10(5) mu m(3), and 10(8) to 2x10(8) mu m(3)). Andean Flamingo faeces were composed mainly of microalgae, especially diatoms. Cladocera and Copepoda species were found to a lesser extent, showing the flamingos' preference for intermediate prey sizes (10(4) to 2x10(5) mu m(3)). Food selection was probably dependent on the spatial variability in prey availability, as both positive selectivity (for Bacillariophyceae) and avoidance (for Copepoda) were observed in Chilean Flamingos. In contrast, Andean Flamingos showed a high positive selection for diatoms, and strong negative selection for microinvertebrates. Both flamingo species can apparently coexist whilst feeding on a wide spectrum of microorganisms, but trophic niches differed in the amounts of Cyanobacteria, microalgae and microinvertebrates taken. Such a low niche overlap probably contributes to the coexistence of both sympatric species in similar waters.","2018",NA,NA,"WOS:000450123000002"

The PN reactor operated with moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) technology, using plastic supports (carriers) for biofilm development. The microeukaryote community from the biofilm (BF) and the surrounding media (mixed liquor or ML) were analysed separately. Despite the physicochemical conditions under which the PN-MBBR operated (an average of 305.9 +/- 117 mg TAN l(-1) and 328.4 +/- 131.9 mg N-NO2- l(-1)), up to 24 microeukaryotic taxa were observed by microscope. Microeukaryote species showed an uneven distribution in the PN-MBBR, thus suggesting the existence of two habitats: the BF, preferred by species with specific structures for adhering to a substrate, such as the stalked Peritrichia, and the ML, preferred by free-swimming or non-substrate dependent species. The results indicated that most ciliate population dynamics mainly responded to the nitrous acid and free ammonia concentrations and, to a lesser extent, to sCOD values. In the BF, variations in the population of Epistylis camprubii and Opercularia coarctata suggest the existence of competition between these species due to niche overlap.

In this study, we explored changes in the trophic niche overlap of dung beetles between the native forest and different land uses in the semideciduous Atlantic forest, under the hypothesis that trophic niche overlap increases with species richness. We sampled dung beetles in protected native forests and four land uses (pine plantations, agroforestry parklands, silvo-pastoral systems and open pastures), using seven potential food sources (monkey, feline, tapir and deer dung, decomposing fruit, decomposing fungi and carrion). The species richness of each habitat, the trophic niche overlap and the relation between both measures were analysed. Also, we explored species trophic preferences in each habitat to explain and discuss the results obtained in trophic niche overlap measures. As expected, our results showed a positive relation between species richness and trophic niche overlap. Moreover, the addition of different resources in open habitats did not increase species richness, suggesting that resource availability may not be the main mechanism explaining the empoverished dung beetle community observed in open habitats. Other mechanisms, such as physiological restrictions, may play a role in limiting the use of these habitats. Studies on the mechanisms leading to the patterns of species abundance and diversity observed in land uses are necessary to propose management recommendations that increase the sustainability of open habitats.","2018",NA,"10.1111/icad.12299","WOS:000449713000004"

Designed to encapsulate broad- to fine-scale variations, seasonal in situ bihourly monitoring of abiotic and phytoplankton components took place at a fixed location over a 24-h period on four sampling occasions. Four known HAB species were recorded at bloom concentrations (> 20 mu g Chl-a L-1) during the study, including Heterosigma akashiwo, Heterocapsa rotundata, Mesodinium rubrum, and Karenia cf. mikimotoi.

Evidence of niche overlap between all four HAB taxa was highlighted by their predilection for elevated nitrate levels, a vertically stratified water column and mesohaline (ca. 10) surface waters. As such, internal biotic processes such as plasticity of diel vertical migration patterns, reliance of M. rubrum on suitable 'prey' resources, and the suppressive pressure of H. akashiwo on co-occurring taxa-explained phytoplankton community dynamics beyond the influence of physico-chemical variability.

These habitats have contrasting levels of food availability, especially in terms of prey diversity, with higher microalgae diversity in the estuary than in the marine surf-zone. In these contrasting conditions, we predicted that both mullet species will have (a) higher niche overlap and smaller niche breadth at the marine surf-zone due to the common exploration of highly abundant surf-zone diatoms and (b) lower niche overlap and higher niche breadth inside the estuary due to selective feeding on more diverse food resources. Isotope niche areas (measured as standard ellipse areas) were higher in the estuary (6.10 and 6.18) than in the marine surf-zone (3.68 and 3.37) for both M. curema and M. liza, respectively. We observed an overlap of 52% in isotopic niches of both species in the marine surf-zone and none in the estuary. We also found contrasting patterns in the diet composition between species according to the habitat. At the marine surfzone, diatoms of the classes Bacillariophyceae and Coscinodiscophyceae dominated (> 99%) the food content of both mullet species. In contrast, green algae, cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates and flagellates comprised the diet of both species in the estuary. These results could be explained by spatial differences in food availability (especially regarding diversity of microalgae) between both habitats. At the marine site, both species explored the most abundant microalgae available (mostly the surf-zone diatom Asterionellopsis cf guyunusae and fragments of Coscinodiscus), whereas in the estuary both species shifted their diets to explore the greater diversity of microalgae resources. Overall, our findings revealed that niche partitioning theory could not fully predict changes in breadth and overlap of food niches of estuarine dependent fish species with complex life cycles encompassing marine to estuarine systems with contrasting food availabilities.","2018",NA,"10.1556/168.2018.19.2.3","WOS:000446184200003"

Phytoplankton species coexistence puzzle in a competition model incorporating multiple resource-limitation and synthesizing unit concepts","ECOLOGICAL MODELLING","The predictions of the competitive exclusion principle about the number of coexisting species not exceeding the number of limiting resources in equilibrium constitute an ecological puzzle for phytoplankton ecosystems. Here we present a synthesizing unit (SU) based competition model taking co-limitation into account, which is the extension of the competition model developed by Dutta et al. (2014).The study aims at understanding the mechanisms of violation of competitive exclusion principle for phytoplankton species with seasonal environmental forcing when multiple resource limitation is taken into account and species growth is formulated based on SU. We also explore the role of changing environmental conditions on species coexistence on a seasonal and a decadal time scale by linking the model forcing to the Helgoland Roads Time Series data sets. For the first time, based on the Helgoland Roads data, we are able to find a realistic parameterization for the phytoplankton competition model where growth is formulated using SU concept. Our study confirms that more species than limiting resources can coexist with seasonal variations of environmental conditions. This supersaturation is related to periodic changes in species' biomass, variation in interspecific competition and niche configuration, nonlinear functional response and the position of resource supply within the convex hull of species' resource uptake rate. Changes in environmental conditions within realistic ranges do not prevent the coexistence of species rather it slightly changes species' biomass and turnover time. This study also confirms that our model with SU based species growth performs better than species competition model where multiple resource limitation is formulated based on the product of several Monod functions. Our study has created a new avenue for phytoplankton coexistence research and the results might be helpful to answer the complex questions on species diversity maintenance in nature.","2018",NA,"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2018.05.021","WOS:000437991600016"

It remains unclear, however, how quickly niche preference evolves and whether more closely related lineages are more likely to share ecological niches. We addressed these questions by following the dynamics of two bloom-forming cyanobacterial genera over an 8-year time-course in Lake Champlain, Canada, using 16S amplicon sequencing and measurements of several environmental parameters. The two genera, Microcystis (M) and Dolichospermum (D), are frequently observed simultaneously during bloom events and thus have partially overlapping niches. However, the extent of their niche overlap is debated, and it is also unclear to what extent niche partitioning occurs among strains within each genus. To identify strains within each genus, we applied minimum entropy decomposition (MED) to 16S rRNA gene sequences. We confirmed that at a genus level, M and D have different preferences for nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. Within each genus, we also identified strains differentially associated with temperature, precipitation, and concentrations of nutrients and toxins. In general, niche similarity between strains (as measured by co-occurrence over time) declined with genetic distance. This pattern is consistent with habitat filtering - in which closely related taxa are ecologically similar, and therefore tend to co-occur under similar environmental conditions. In contrast with this general pattern, similarity in certain niche dimensions (notably particulate nitrogen and phosphorus) did not decline linearly with genetic distance, and instead showed a complex polynomial relationship. This observation suggests the importance of processes other than habitat filtering - such as competition between closely related taxa, or convergent trait evolution in distantly related taxa - in shaping particular traits in microbial communities.","2018",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2018.00438","WOS:000428394600001"

The interaction of the reef topography with hydrodynamics is known to enhance the supply of suspended food sources to the reef communities. However, the reef framework is also a substrate for other organisms that may compete for the very same suspended food sources. Here, we used the passive suspension feeder Lophelia pertusa and the active suspension feeding sponge Hymedesmia coriacea as model organisms to study niche overlap using isotopically-enriched algae and bacteria as suspended food sources. The coral and the sponge were fed with a combination of C-13-enriched bacteria/N-15-enriched algae or N-15-enriched bacteria/C-13-enriched algae, which was subsequently traced into bulk tissue, coral skeleton and dissolved inorganic carbon (i.e. respiration). Both the coral and the sponge assimilated and respired the suspended bacteria and algae, indicating niche overlap between these species. The assimilation rates of C and N into bulk tissue of specimens incubated separately were not significantly different from assimilation rates during incubations with co-occurring corals and sponges. Hence, no evidence for exploitative resource competition was found, but this is likely due to the saturating experimental food concentration that was used. We do not rule out that exploitative competition occurs in nature during periods of low food concentrations. Food assimilation and respiration rates of the sponge were almost an order of magnitude higher than those of the cold water coral. We hypothesize that the active suspension feeding mode of the sponge explains the observed differences in resource uptake as opposed to the passive suspension feeding mode of the cold-water coral. These feeding mode differences may set constraints on suitable habitats for cold-water corals and sponges in their natural habitats.","2018",NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0194659","WOS:000428351800043"

However, niche dynamics and risk predictions of marine invasions integrating phylogeographic structure in the analyses have not yet been investigated. In this study, we perform a comprehensive analysis of two invasive lineages of Caulerpa taxifolia with different residence time in the Mediterranean Sea for a better understanding of their invasive processes. We performed lineage-based and species-based niche models to assess the risk of invasion, the spatial overlap, and the variables delimiting the distribution of the two lineages. We also compared the effect of using different extents on niche overlap and niche shift analyses. Intraspecific models with pooled occurrences accurately found two separate regions susceptible of invasion for each invasive lineage in the Mediterranean, while species-based predictions underestimated invaded regions. The invasive lineages spread across colder coastal areas than the species. Altogether, we provide evidence that different invasive lineages of algae show dissimilar environmental responses and invasive ranges that are not detectable by species-based analyses. Moreover, niche overlap and niche shift analyses seem to depend greatly on the geographical extent used. According to the most appropriate extent (worldwide), the invaded range did not show niche shift, and thus, no evidence of a post-introduction adaptation scenario was found as both lineages invaded habitats similar to their Australian native locations. Actions to prevent further spreading of the most recent invasive lineage are needed.","2018",NA,"10.1007/s10530-017-1544-8","WOS:000426065700013"

Yet, the evolutionary advantage of horizontal gene transfer has not been well understood and is constantly being debated. Here we propose a simple population dynamics model based on frequency dependent genotype interactions to evaluate the influence of horizontal gene transfer on microbial communities. In particular, we examine the structural stability of coexistence (i.e., the capability of the system to maintain species coexistence in response to small changes in parameters), as well as the robustness (defined as the maximal degree of perturbation the system can sustain around a stable coexistence steady state) of microbial communities. We find that both structural stability of coexistence and robustness of the microbial community are strongly affected by the gene transfer rate and direction. An optimal gene flux can stabilize the ecosystem, helping it recover from disturbance and maintain the species coexistence. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We combined a novel dataset of hydrographic properties, turbulent mixing, nutrient concentration, and picoplankton community composition with the aims of (i) quantifying the role of temperature, light, and nitrate fluxes as factors controlling the distribution of autotrophic and heterotrophic picoplankton subgroups, as determined by flow cytometry, and (ii) describing the ecological niches of the various components of the picoplankton community. Data were collected at 97 stations in the Atlantic Ocean, including tropical and subtropical open-ocean waters, the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, and the Galician coastal upwelling system of the northwest Iberian Peninsula. A generalized additive model (GAM) approach was used to predict depth-integrated biomass of each picoplankton subgroup based on three niche predictors: sea surface temperature, averaged daily surface irradiance, and the transport of nitrate into the euphotic zone, through both diffusion and advection. In addition, niche overlap among different picoplankton subgroups was computed using nonparametric kernel density functions. Temperature and nitrate supply were more relevant than light in predicting the biomass of most picoplankton subgroups, except for Prochlorococcus and low-nucleic-acid (LNA) prokaryotes, for which irradiance also played a significant role. Nitrate supply was the only factor that allowed the distinction among the ecological niches of all autotrophic and heterotrophic picoplankton subgroups. Prochlorococcus and LNA prokaryotes were more abundant in warmer waters (> 20 degrees C) where the nitrate fluxes were low, whereas Synechococcus and high-nucleic-acid (HNA) prokaryotes prevailed mainly in cooler environments characterized by intermediate or high levels of nitrate supply. Finally, the niche of picoeukaryotes was defined by low temperatures and high nitrate supply. These results support the key role of nitrate supply, as it not only promotes the growth of large phytoplankton, but it also controls the structure of marine picoplankton communities.","2018",NA,"10.5194/bg-15-6199-2018","WOS:000448811900001"

The temporal variation of the particulate matter reflected a mixture between marine and terrestrial sources throughout the year, with a clear marine influence during summer and fall, and predominance of terrestrial inputs during spring and winter. The digestive gland was a useful rapid turnover tissue, where the carbon isotope signal was species-specific and the nitrogen isotope one was site-specific. FA markers in the digestive gland revealed a mixed diet where Callista chione fed more upon fresh material than G. bimaculata which relied largely on bacteria-derived detritus.

Secondly, we used a carbon (C-13) and nitrogen (N-15) isotope Bayesian mixing model to estimate relative assimilation. All characids consumed large proportions of plant material and aquatic insects; however, Pianka's index indicated low dietary overlap among species throughout most of the sampling period. The low degrees of dietary overlap were due to discrepancies in the relative consumption of Ephemeroptera and aquatic insect remains. Secondly, there was high correspondence between the gut content analyses and isotope mixing model estimates. Astyanax xiru and Bryconamericus iheringii were the only species that ingested and assimilated large fractions of aquatic plants and algae, respectively. Astyanax procerus consumed and assimilated large fractions of terrestrial invertebrates, whereas Bryconamericus sp. assimilated mainly aquatic invertebrates. Therefore, we demonstrate that the assimilated nutrients were consistent with the relative consumption of food items.

However, little is known about how competition among plant species alters the strength and direction of grazing induced plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs). In a previous monoculture experiment, we found that the intensity of sheep grazing generated consistent abiotic feedback effects and species-specific biotic feedback effects. To test if and how interspecific plant competition modifies the PSFs observed in our previous monoculture experiment, five naturally-occurring plant species (Artemisia capillaris, Dodnrtia orientalis, Lespedeza davurica, Oxybropis racemosa, and Stipa bungeana) were grown in mixed communities in sterilized and unsterilized soils from plots of four grazing intensities (0, 2.7, 5.3, and 8.7 sheep/ha). Further, the five plant species were grown in mixtures in treatment-specific soil following inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM) and/or a mixture of pathogenic Fusarium species (FU), to test the contribution of these two fungal groups to biotic PSFs. All plant species experienced net neutral to positive abiotic and biotic PSFs. Compared with our previous monoculture experiment, we found that the presence of interspecific competition did not change the abiotic PSF effects generated with increasing grazing intensity, but shifted the direction and strength of the biotic PSFs generated within each grazing intensity. The presence of pathogenic Fusarium-only significantly decreased the proportional biomass of the dominant species A. capillaris and S. bungeana, and the presence of AM fungi-only significantly increased the proportional biomass of the subordinate species D. orientalis and O. racemosa. Our study strongly suggests that in grazed ecosystems interspecific competition and biotic PSFs interact to drive plant community dynamics, and also that soil mutualists such as AM fungi have the potential to promote plant species coexistence by facilitating the performance of subordinate species.","2018",NA,"10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.08.029","WOS:000447580800015"
"Depraetere, TMA; Daly, AJ; Baetens, JM; De Baets, B","Three-species competition with non-deterministic outcomes","CHAOS","Theoretical and experimental research studies have shown that ecosystems governed by non-transitive competition networks tend to maintain high levels of biodiversity. The theoretical body of work, however, has mainly focused on competition networks in which the outcomes of competition events are predetermined and hence deterministic, and where all species are identical up to their competitive relationships, an assumption that may limit the applicability of theoretical results to real-life situations. In this paper, we aim to probe the robustness of the link between biodiversity and non-transitive competition by introducing a three-dimensional winning probability parameter space, making the outcomes of competition events in a three-species in silico ecosystem uncertain. While two degenerate points in this parameter space have been the subject of previous studies, we investigate the remaining settings, which equip the species with distinct competitive abilities. We find that the impact of this modification depends on the spatial dimension of the system. When the system is well mixed, it collapses to monoculture, as is also the case in the non-transitive deterministic setting. In one dimension, chaotic patterns emerge, which tend to maintain biodiversity, and a power law relates the time that species manage to coexist to the degree of uncertainty regarding competition event outcomes. In two dimensions, the formation of spiral wave patterns ensures that biodiversity is maintained for moderate degrees of uncertainty, while considerable deviations from the non-transitive deterministic setting have strong negative effects on species coexistence. It can hence be concluded that non-transitive competition can still produce coexistence when the assumption of deterministic competition is abandoned. When the system collapses to monoculture, one observes a survival of the strongest law, as the species that has the highest probability of defeating its competitors has the best odds to become the sole survivor.

"Hertäg, C; Vorburger, C","Defensive symbionts mediate species coexistence in phytophagous insects","FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY","Competition of two species for the same resource is expected to result in competitive exclusion of the inferior competitor. In natural communities, however, other antagonists and symbionts moderate competition. Thus, we have to go beyond studying pairwise interactions. Natural enemies may facilitate coexistence if they affect the superior competitor more strongly, or they can hinder coexistence via apparent competition. Less well studied is the role of symbionts, which may influence species coexistence in conjunction with enemies. Eukaryotes commonly harbour microbial endosymbionts that provide protection against natural enemies, but are costly in their absence. Such defensive symbionts could thus mediate coexistence of species competing for the same resource, both in the presence and in the absence of enemies, but as yet there is little evidence for this claim. We addressed this proposed role of defensive symbionts in replicated simple communities consisting of two aphid species sharing the same host plant and the same natural enemy, a parasitoid wasp. Both, one, or neither species were infected with a resistance-conferring symbiont, and they competed in the absence as well as the presence of parasitoids. The symbiont had significant effects in the absence of parasitoids by lowering competitive ability especially in one species, but the effects were more dramatic in the presence of parasitoids. With both species protected by the symbiont, parasitoid densities remained low and both aphid species persisted. When neither species was protected, parasitoids drove both species to extinction. Surprisingly, the same outcome was observed when only one species was protected. The susceptible species supported high densities of parasitoids that also killed the resistant aphids via mechanisms other than parasitism, presumably by disturbing them to the point of starvation. This is an intriguing form of apparent competition. Our results demonstrate an important role of defensive symbionts in insect communities through modifying species interactions. This highlights the need for experimental data when studying species coexistence in competitive networks. Furthermore, the observation that a susceptible host can negatively affect a resistant host via a shared parasitoid is an instructive insight for biological control.","2018",NA,"10.1111/1365-2435.13040","WOS:000429323400020"

Because the orientation effect may vary with species, we hypothesize that habitat orientation may alter interspecific interactions between animal species. We experimentally investigated how habitat orientation (placing cuboid chambers in three orientations with long, medium, and small side as the chamber height) affected the interaction between two common cladoceran species, Daphnia magna and Moina micrura, which competitively exploited green algae of Chlorella pyrenoidosa at two volume scales (64 and 512ml). Results show that chamber orientation and volume additively affected the behavior and species performance of the grazers. Specifically, both grazer species generally decreased their average swimming velocity, grazing rate (on algal cells), body size, and survival and reproduction rates with increasing chamber height for both chamber volumes and with decreasing chamber volume regardless of chamber orientation. Nevertheless, the decrease magnitude was greater for M.micrura with increasing chamber height but was greater for D.magna with decreasing chamber volume. Correspondingly, when cocultured, the density ratio of D.magna to M.micrura increased with increasing chamber height but decreased with decreasing chamber volume. At the end of the experiment, none of D.magna individuals survived in the small and short (large-based) chambers, and few M.micrura individuals survived in large and tall (small-based) chambers. These results indicate that both habitat orientation and size affect the outcome of interspecific competition between grazer species.

However, almost all natural systems are subject to fluctuations of resources driven by cyclical processes such as seasonality and tidal hydrology. To understand community composition, it is therefore imperative to study the impact of resource fluctuations on interspecies competition. We adapted a well-established resource-competition model to show that fluctuations in inflow concentrations of two limiting resources lead to the survival of species in clumps along the trait axis, consistent with observations of lumpy coexistence [Scheffer M, van Nes EH (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 103: 6230-6235]. A complex dynamic pattern in the available ambient resources arose very early in the self-organization process and dictated the locations of clumps along the trait axis by creating niches that promoted the growth of species with specific traits. This dynamic pattern emerged as the combined result of fluctuations in the inflow of resources and their consumption by the most competitive species that accumulated the bulk of biomass early in assemblage organization. Clumps emerged robustly across a range of periodicities, phase differences, and amplitudes. Given the ubiquity in the real world of asynchronous fluctuations of limiting resources, our findings imply that assemblage organization in clumps should be a common feature in nature.","2018",NA,"10.1073/pnas.1705944115","WOS:000423097800057"

Here, we synthesize the powerful paradigm emerging from these two patterns, connecting the roles of function, functional redundancy and taxonomy in microbial systems.

Recent documentation of pneumonia in mountain goats highlights their susceptibility to bacterial pathogens typically associated with bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) epizootics. Respiratory pathogen communities of mountain goats are poorly characterized yet have important implications for management and conservation of both species. We characterized resident pathogen communities across a range of mountain goat populations as an initial step to inform management efforts. Between 2010 and 2017, we sampled 98 individuals within three regions of the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA), with a smaller sampling effort in southeast Alaska, US. Within the GYA, we detected Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae in two regions and we found at least two Pasteurellaceae species in animals from all regions. Mannheimia haemolytica was the only pathogen that we detected in southeast Alaska. Given the difficult sampling conditions, limited sample size, and imperfect detection, our failure to detect specific pathogens should be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, respiratory pathogens within the GYA may be an important, yet underappreciated, cause of mountain goat mortality. Moreover, because of the strong niche overlap of bighorn sheep and mountain goats, interspecific transmission is an important concern for managers restoring or introducing mountain ungulates within sympatric ranges.","2018",NA,"10.7589/2018-02-025","WOS:000446684500026"

We investigated seasonal variation in diet composition of Bokermannohyla saxicola tadpoles and compared diets between two developmental stages with a significant difference in size. We found that the diet of B. saxicola tadpoles was dominated by periphytic algae, in accordance with their benthic habits. Considering number of cells ingested, tadpole trophic niches were broader in more advanced developmental stages. Tadpole trophic niches were narrower during the summer (wet season) than during the winter (dry season), which may reflect increased consumption of more energetic food items during the warm period when primary productivity is expected to be higher. Tadpole metabolism is likely to be higher in the summer and increased energetic needs might be supplied in this manner. However, results differed when biovolume was considered instead of number of cells ingested, with larger items assuming a greater importance and niches being usually larger in the summer. In these cases, the increased ingestion of diatoms (likely to be more nutritive) in the summer may decrease the relative importance of large algae (e.g., Mougeotia sp.) that form the bulk of the diet. Both food availability/accessibility and tadpole feeding behaviour driven by nutritional needs may influence patterns of food acquisition. Given the importance of biofilms to tadpole diet, studies on the mechanisms by which tadpole nutritional needs and environmental conditions interact are likely to provide important insights into the dynamics of aquatic food webs.","2018",NA,"10.1163/15685381-17000209","WOS:000455989100004"

Understanding the functions and dynamics of such microbial communities is a very important theme not only for ecology but also for humankind because microbes can play major roles in our health. Yet, it remains unclear how such complex ecosystems are maintained. Here, we present a simple theory on the dynamics of a microbial community. Bacteria preferring a particular pH in their environment indirectly inhibit the growth of the other types of bacteria by changing the pH to their optimum value. This pH-driven interaction always causes a state of bistability involving different types of bacteria that can be more or less abundant. Furthermore, a moderate abundance ratio of different types of bacteria can confer enhanced resilience to a specific equilibrium state, particularly when a trade-off relationship exists between growth and the ability of bacteria to change the pH of their environment. These results suggest that the balance of the composition of microbiota plays a critical role in maintaining microbial communities.","2018",NA,"10.1098/rsos.180476","WOS:000446259700021"
"Spear, ER; Mordecai, EA","Foliar pathogens are unlikely to stabilize coexistence of competing species in a California grassland","ECOLOGY","Pathogen infection is common in wild plants and animals, and may regulate their populations. If pathogens have narrow host ranges and increase with the density of their favored hosts, they may promote host species diversity by suppressing common species to the benefit of rare species. Yet, because many pathogens infect multiple co-occurring hosts, they may not strongly respond to the relative abundance of a single host species. Are natural communities dominated by specialized pathogens that respond to the relative abundance of a specific host or by pathogens with broad host ranges and limited responses to the relative abundance of single host? The answer determines the potential for pathogens to promote host coexistence, as often hypothesized, or to have negligible or even negative effects on host coexistence. We lack a systematic understanding of the impacts, identities, and host ranges of pathogens in natural communities. Here we characterize a community of foliar fungal pathogens and evaluate their host specificity and fitness impacts in a California grassland community of native and exotic species. We found that most of the commonly isolated fungal pathogens were multi-host, with intermediate to low specialization. The amount of pathogen damage each host experienced was independent of host species local relative abundance. Despite pathogen sharing among the host species, fungal communities slightly differed in composition across host species. Plants with high pathogen damage tended to have lower seed production but the relationship was weak, suggesting limited fitness impacts. Moreover, seed production was not dependent on the local relative abundance of each plant species, suggesting that stabilizing coexistence mechanisms may operate at larger spatial scales in this community. Because foliar pathogens in this grassland community are multi-host and have small fitness impacts, they are unlikely to promote negative frequency dependence or plant species coexistence in this system. Still, given that pathogen community composition differentiates across host species, some more subtle feedbacks between host relative abundance and pathogen community composition, damage, and fitness impacts are possible, which could, in turn, promote either coexistence or competitive exclusion.","2018",NA,"10.1002/ecy.2427","WOS:000446270400013"

When seedlings are grown under the same mycorrhizal type forest, arbuscular mycorrhizal plant species exhibit negative or neutral feedbacks and ectomycorrhizal plant species do neutral or positive feedbacks. In contrast, positive and neutral feedbacks dominate when seedlings are grown in associations within the same versus different mycorrhizal types.

Whether climate perturbations alter niche occupancy among co-occurring species and affect species diversity is a key, but unanswered question. Using CO2 vents as natural analogues of ocean acidification, we show that competing fish species with overlapping diets are partially segregated across microhabitat niches and differently-orientated substrata under ambient CO2 conditions. Under elevated CO2, benthic microhabitats experienced a significant increase in non-calcifying turf and fleshy algae but a sharp reduction in calcareous algae. The increased availability of turf and fleshy algae supported increased densities of a competitively dominant species, whilst the reduction in calcifying algal microhabitats decreased densities of several subordinate species. The change in microhabitat availability also drove an increased overlap in microhabitat use among competing fishes at the vents, associated with a reduced fish species richness on horizontal substrates. We conclude that loss of preferred microhabitat niches, exacerbated by population proliferation of competitively dominant species, can drive population losses of less common and subordinate species, and reduce local species richness. The indirect effects of ocean acidification on microhabitat availability can therefore impair maintenance of species populations, and drive changes in local community and biodiversity patterns.

Plant resource partitioning is a mechanism promoting species coexistence and ecosystem functioning. Yet, we still have limited understanding of how soil microbes, especially plant symbiotic microbes, influence resource partitioning. We hypothesized that soil-borne microbes, in particular mycorrhizal fungi, facilitate differential performance of tree species depending on different nitrogen sources and that this leads to a positive plant diversity-community productivity relationship. 2. We conducted two complementing glasshouse experiments. In a monoculture experiment, we supplied nitrogen as ammonium, nitrate or glycine and tested the growth response of three tree species associated with different root symbionts: one associated with ectomycorrhizal fungi, one associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and the third associated with both arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and N-fixing bacteria. In an intermixed experiment, we grew the tree species at three richness levels (one, two or three species) in soil supplied with a mix of the three nitrogen forms or no added nitrogen, and with or without soil microbes. 3. The monoculture experiment showed that in the presence of soil microbes, the ectomycorrhizal plant species grew best when supplied with glycine and the two arbuscular mycorrhizal plant species grew best with either nitrate or ammonium addition. When the different forms of nitrogen were mixed in the intermixed experiment, plant mixtures produced more biomass than plant monocultures in the presence of soil microbes, with positive complementarity effects indicating microbe-mediated plant resource partitioning. 4. Our results suggest that co-existing tree species can partition soil nitrogen when grown with their particular mycorrhizal symbionts or other soil microbes, resulting in positive biodiversity effects in complex resource environments.","2018",NA,"10.1111/1365-2435.13109","WOS:000437281100020"
"Meyer, SE; Beckstead, J; Allen, PS","Niche specialization in Bromus tectorum seed bank pathogens","SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH","Niche theory predicts that when two species exhibit major niche overlap, one will eventually be eliminated through competitive exclusion. Thus, some degree of niche specialization is required to facilitate coexistence. We examined whether two important seed bank pathogens on the invasive winter annual grass Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass, downy brome) exhibit niche specialization. These pathogens utilize seed resources in complementary ways. Pyrenophora semeniperda is specialized to attack dormant seeds. It penetrates directly through the seed coverings. Hyphae ramify first through the endosperm and then throughout the seed. Seed death results as the embryo is consumed. In contrast, the Fusarium seed rot pathogen (Fusarium sp.) is specialized to attack non-dormant seeds in the early stages of germination. It cannot penetrate seed coverings directly. Instead, it responds to a cue emanating from the radicle end with directional hyphal growth and subsequent penetration at the point of radicle emergence, causing seed death. Non-dormant seeds usually escape P. semeniperda through germination even if infected because it develops more slowly than Fusarium. When water stress slows non-dormant seed germination, both P. semeniperda and Fusarium can attack and cause seed mortality more effectively. The Fusarium seed rot pathogen can sometimes reach epidemic levels and may result in B. tectorum stand failure ('die-off'). Stands usually re-establish from the persistent seed bank, but if P. semeniperda has also reached high levels and eliminated the seed bank, a die-off can persist indefinitely.","2018",NA,"10.1017/S0960258518000193","WOS:000447315600009"

In this contribution, we explored the co-occurrence of chironomid larvae belonging to congeneric species within four genera of chironomids: Cricotopus, Eukiefferiella, Orthocladius and Rheocricotopus (with 2, 7, 2 and 4 species, respectively) in the headwaters of a small Mediterranean calcareous stream. Due to the intrinsic, natural spatial and temporal variability in these habitats, we studied three different sites at two different seasons within the annual hydrological cycle (spring vs summer samples), and each microhabitat unit was surveyed with an effort proportional to its cover at the sampling site. The Outlying Median Index method was used to distinguish the niches of the different chironomid species in relation to the hydraulic features and substrates within each site. Our results showed that hydraulic features helped to improve discrimination between the niches of five congeneric species of Eukiefferiella, and the same occurred within the species belonging to Cricotopus and Orthocladius, although niche overlap was high in general. One Rheocricotopus species was associated to algal substrate. Schoener's co-occurrence at the microhabitat scale was low among the congeneric species found in our study, suggesting exclusion mechanisms.

We considered the plant's ability to preferentially allocate carbon to mutualists and competition for plant carbon between mutualist and nonmutualist symbionts. We treated carbon as two nutritionally interchangeable, but temporally separated, resourcescarbon allocated indiscriminately for the construction of the symbiosis, and carbon preferentially allocated to the mutualist after symbiosis establishment and assessment. This approach demonstrated that coexistence of mutualists and nonmutualists is possible when fidelity of the plant to the mutualist and the cost of mutualism mediate resource competition. Furthermore, it allowed us to trace symbiont population dynamics given varying degrees of carbon allocation. Specifically, coexistence occurs at intermediate levels of preferential allocation. Our findings are consistent with previous empirical studies as well the application of biological market theory to plantroot symbioses.","2018",NA,"10.1002/ece3.4118","WOS:000435776600050"

We ask whether co-occurring trees that associate with different types of mycorrhizal fungi, which are hypothesized to differ in terms of nutrient use and plant-soil feedbacks, differ in sapling establishment densities and probability of co-occurrence. Given that ectomycorrhizal (ECM) trees typically have fungal structures that protect roots from pathogens whereas arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) trees do not, we hypothesized that ECM saplings would be clustered around ECM trees, while AM saplings would be suppressed near AM trees. Most previous studies have focused on seedlings, but here we examine whether the spatial signal is evident in later life stages. We measured the spatial associations of similar to 28,000 trees using point pattern analysis in a 25-ha old-growth forest where ECM trees comprised 72% of total basal area and 42% of the total stems, while AM trees comprised the remainder. Supporting our hypothesis, AM saplings were more inhibited by AM trees, while ECM saplings were more clustered around ECM trees. The spatial patterns of AM and ECM trees on saplings of the alternate mycorrhizal type were inhibited. To the extent that similar types of feedbacks occur for other AM and ECM trees, our results suggest that fundamental differences in the nature of local-scale biotic interactions between trees and their fungal symbionts may influence forest community assembly and ecosystem dynamics.","2018",NA,"10.1007/s00442-017-3987-0","WOS:000419477800020"

However, we still have limited knowledge of how such plant-fungus associations vary in their community-scale properties depending on fungal functional groups and geographic locations. Methods: By compiling a high-throughput sequencing dataset of root-associated fungi in eight forests along the Japanese Archipelago, we performed a comparative analysis of arbuscular mycorrhizal, ectomycorrhizal, and saprotrophic/endophytic associations across a latitudinal gradient from cool-temperate to subtropical regions. Results: In most of the plant-fungus networks analyzed, host-symbiont associations were significantly specialized but lacked nested architecture, which has been commonly reported in plant-pollinator and plant-seed disperser networks. In particular, the entire networks involving all functional groups of plants and fungi and partial networks consisting of ectomycorrhizal plant and fungal species/taxa displayed anti-nested architecture (i.e., negative nestedness scores) in many of the forests examined. Our data also suggested that geographic factors affected the organization of plant-fungus network structure. For example, the southernmost subtropical site analyzed in this study displayed lower network-level specificity of host-symbiont associations and higher (but still low) nestedness than northern localities. Conclusions: Our comparative analyses suggest that arbuscular mycorrhizal, ectomycorrhizal, and saprotrophic/endophytic plant-fungus associations often lack nested network architecture, while those associations can vary, to some extent, in their community-scale properties along a latitudinal gradient.

For example, recent evidence shows that above- and belowground herbivory, individually and in combination, can modify how a plant community responds to nitrogen (N) eutrophication, an important driver of global change. However, knowledge about how such effects extend to the associated soil food web is lacking. In a mesocosm experiment, we investigated how communities of soil nematodes - an abundant and functionally important group of soil organisms - responded to above- and belowground insect herbivory at contrasting N levels. We found that the strongest influence of above- and belowground herbivory on the nematode community appeared at elevated N. The abundance of root-feeding nematodes increased when either above- or belowground insect herbivores were present at elevated N, but when applied together the two herbivore types cancelled out one another's effect. Additionally, at elevated N aboveground herbivory increased the abundance of fungal-feeders relative to bacterial-feeders, which indicates changes in decomposition pathways induced by N and herbivory. Belowground herbivory increased the abundance of omnivorous nematodes. The shifts in both the herbivorous and detrital parts of the soil food web demonstrate that above- and belowground herbivory does not only mediate the response of the plant community to N eutrophication, but in extension also the soil food web sustained by the plant community. We conclude that feedbacks between effects of above- and belowground herbivory mediate the response of the grassland ecosystem to N eutrophication.","2018",NA,"10.1111/oik.04763","WOS:000443304900006"

Studies simultaneously analysing these drivers of competition hierarchy are rare. Additionally, organisms compete either directly or via interference competition for resources or space, within a local neighbourhood or across the habitat. Therefore, the drivers of competition could change accordingly and depend on the taxa studied. We performed the first multi-taxon study on pairwise competition across major taxonomic groups, including experiments with vascular plants, mosses, saprobic fungi, aquatic protists and soil bacteria. We evaluated how general is competition intransitivity from the pairwise competition matrix including all species and also for each possible three-species combination (triplets). We then examined which species were likely to engage in competitive loops and the effects of environmental conditions, competitive rank and functional traits on intransitive competition. We found some degree of competition intransitivity in all taxa studied, with 38% to 5% of triplets being intransitive. Variance in competitive rank between species and more fertile conditions strongly reduced intransitivity, with triplets composed of species differing widely in their competitive ranks much less likely to be intransitive. Including functional traits of the species involved more than doubled the variation explained compared to models including competitive rank only. Both trait means and variance within triplets affected the odds of them being intransitive. However, the traits responsible and the direction of trait effects varied widely between taxa, suggesting that traits can have a wide variety of effects on competition.Synthesis. We evaluated the drivers of competition across multiple taxa and showed that productivity and competitive rank are fundamental drivers of intransitivity. We also showed that not only the functional traits of each species, but also those of the accompanying species, determine competition intransitivity.

However, estuaries have been used as fishing grounds by the artisanal fishers in Tanzania.The slow-growing predatory fish at juvenile and sub-adult stages are among the most frequently caught species that functionally enhance multiple linkages of energy pathways within the food web. Stomach contents and stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) were used to describe the nutritional sources and trophic niches between the co-existing benthic, predatory species, Carangoides chrysophrys and Epinephelus malabaricus in the Pangani estuary,Tanzania. Results: The findings indicated significant inter-specific variations in dietary composition (PERMANOVA, p = 0 001, pseudo-F= 15.81. The prey-specific index of relative importance (%PSIRI) indicated that juvenile shrimps (%PSIRI = 51.4) and Teleostei (%PSIRI = 26.5) were the main diets of C.chrysophrys while brachyura (%PSIRI = 38.8), juvenile shrimps (%PSIRI = 25.6) and Teleostei (%PSIRI = 23.3) were important diets of E.malabaricus. The isotope mixing models indicated that the predatory fish species accumulate nutrients derived from similar autotrophic sources, microphytobenthos, seagrass and macro-algae via consumption of small fish, including clupeids and mugilids. Yet, they significantly showed different isotopic niche width with varying degree of niche overlap across the longitudinal estuary gradient. This situation was justified by the presence of basal food sources among the estuarine zones that isotopically were different. Conclusion: The reliance of both predators on clupeids and mugilid preys that are trophically linked with estuarine and marine basal food sources, is an indication of low estuarine food webs'connectivity to the fresh water related food web. This situation is most likely threatening the stability of the estuarine food web structure.

We here show how differences between a pathogen's native and invasive observed niche and their underlying environments affect this process, using the recent emergence of Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal) as a critical, empirical example. Location Methods Palaearctic. To quantify observed niches, we first gathered occurrences from the native Asian and invasive European distribution of Bsal. Through ordination in PCA-bound environmental space, we then applied overlap tests to compare native and invasive Bsal niches with those of 56 putative Western Palaearctic host species. At last, we ensembled bivariate niche models (ESMs) for each Bsal niche to assess how differences in observed niches influenced suitability predictions. Results Main conclusions The observed invasive Bsal niche is a conservative, partially filled subset of its wider native niche. Pathogen-host overlap measured using the narrow invasive niche was nevertheless found to be significantly higher than that of the native niche, which is partly situated in subtropical conditions absent from the Western Palaearctic. ESMs created using the native niche predict high suitability for Bsal throughout Europe. Conversely, a more restricted range was predicted using the invasive niche, which coincides with the presence of oceanic climates in north-western Europe and several Mediterranean mountain ranges. Unequal relative availability of environments in native and invasive ranges may lead to underestimation of observed niche overlap between native pathogen populations and putative hosts in the invasive range. The existence of partially filled niches may add uncertainty to overlap measurements, and predictions of potential further spread. Results based on the invasive niche therefore provide a conservative estimate; yet demonstrate, in our case, that Bsal is already present in conditions shared by numerous host species.

Using the Sioscreen C we have examined spectrophotometrically intraspecies variability of A. flavus using 10 isolates under different environments, including temperature shifts, in terms of growth and aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) production. Five high and five low AFB(1) producers were examined. The study was conducted at 5 isothermal conditions (from 15 to 37 degrees C) and 4 dynamic scenarios (between 15 and 30 degrees C). The experiments were carried out in a semisolid YES medium at 0.92 a(w) and two inoculum levels, 10(2) and 10(3) spores/mL. The Time to Detection (TTD) of growth initiation was determined and modelled as a function of temperature through a polynomial equation and the model was used to predict TTD under temperature upshifts conditions using a novel approach. The results obtained in this study have shown that a model can be developed to describe the effect of temperature upshifts on the TTD for all the studied isolates and inoculum levels. Isolate variability increased as the growth conditions became more stressful and with a lower inoculum level. Inoculum level affected the in-traspedes variability but not the repeatability of the experiments. In dynamic conditions, isolate responses depended both on the temperature shift and, predominantly, the final temperature level. AFB(1) production was highly variable among the isolates and greatly depended on temperature (optimum temperature at 30-35 degrees C) and inoculum levels, with often higher production with lower inoculum. This suggests that, from an ecological point of view, the potential isolate variability and interaction with dynamic conditions should be taken into account in developing strategies to control growth and predicting mycotoxin risks by mycotoxigenic fungi.","2018",NA,"10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2018.02.016","WOS:000430762800001"

By investigating the life-history strategy of sympatric species, we may understand how they are able to coexist, as different strategies are expected to evolve in species that occupy similar niche space. Terrestrial isopods are a group in which multiple species frequently inhabit the same area. Notably, they are usually infected by Wolbachia Hertig, 1936, a notorious manipulator of the hosts' reproductive processes. Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze the investment in reproduction in three sympatric and closely related species of terrestrial isopods: Atlantoscia floridana (Van Name, 1940), Atlantoscia inflata Campos-Filho and Araujo, 2015, and Atlantoscia petronioi Campos-Filho, Contreira and Lopes-Leitzke, 2012, only the latter being infected with Wolbachia. We showed that the presence of the bacteria seems not to affect the fitness of A. petronioi, because there was no clear difference in the reproductive output of infected and noninfected individuals. On the other hand, we observed that the three species possess alternative life-history strategies; that is, they differ in how much they invest in maintenance (body size) and reproductive effort. Such differences probably facilitate the species coexistence, reducing the competition among them.","2018",NA,"10.1139/cjz-2018-0086","WOS:000449749800004"

In a changing global scenario, it will greatly determine the fate of marine organisms and hence is an important subject to be explored. The present study evaluates host specificity of two caprellid amphipod species, Caprella grandimana and Caprella takeuchii, dwelling on a rocky intertidal where the calcifying macroalgae Jania rubens and Ellisolandia elongata show opposite seasonal fluctuation patterns throughout the year. To avoid confounding preference with other factors, the substrate selection experimental design included both multiple choice and non-choice treatments. Macroalgal structure analyses using fractals and interstitial space index were included in the study, as substrate complexity is a main factor driving preference for epifauna. Caprella grandimana actively selected J. rubens, whereas C. takeuchii did not show any preference; both behaviours remaining consistent regardless of the original substrate. Preference for J. rubens is probably owed to its interstitial space and thalli characteristics, as the complexity analysis suggested, since these allow for better refuge against predators and a more suitable surface for grasping. Meanwhile, the plasticity of C. takeuchii seems to favor an ongoing taking over of its congener at the time of the year when J. rubens drops. We highlight the need for rigor when performing substrate selection experiments; the importance of including habitat selection lessons in conservation strategies and modelling studies dealing with global change; and the risk in generalizing results within the family or genus level, which is occasionally inadequate for understanding the functioning of the ecosystem as a whole.","2018",NA,"10.1016/j.beproc.2018.05.005","WOS:000438833700003"
"Little, CJ; Altermatt, F","Species turnover and invasion of dominant freshwater invertebrates alter biodiversity-ecosystem-function relationship","ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS","Freshwater ecosystems rely on allochthonous resources. Integration of these subsidies depends on diversity of both terrestrial resources and aquatic shredder and decomposer communities, but the diversity effects on leaf litter breakdown and decomposition are less clear in aquatic than terrestrial ecosystems. We need a better understanding of this relationship because aquatic communities are rapidly changing with species invasions and anthropogenic impacts. Here, we experimentally disentangled the effects of leaf and shredder richness on leaf litter breakdown by macroinvertebrates in mesocosm experiments using three species of amphipods, a dominant guild of crustaceans in European freshwater ecosystems. Increased leaf richness led to lower-than-predicted leaf consumption by native shredders, with mixed evidence of resource-switching or prioritization of preferred food items within a leaf mix. Higher shredder species richness never promoted leaf consumption rates compared to predictions from relevant single-species experiments, and instead sometimes substantially decreased leaf consumption. We then conducted a meta-analysis of leaf litter consumption rates by seven widely distributed amphipod species (the three used in the experiments and four additional species). As expected based on our own experiments, nonnative amphipod species generally had lower biomass-adjusted leaf litter consumption rates, although their larger body size led to higher per-individual leaf consumption rates. Contamination of the water by metals, pesticides, and other chemicals additionally significantly decreased leaf litter consumption by multiple native and nonnative species compared to unpolluted systems. While the meta-analysis suggested that litter consumption, and thus breakdown, would decline if native shredders are replaced by nonnative heterospecifics, complete species replacement is not the only outcome following immigration in a meta-community context. Our experiments suggest that breakdown rates could remain reasonably high where native species coexist with nonnative arrivals. Experiments that neglect the ecological realism of species coexistence will necessarily mischaracterize effects on ecosystem functioning.","2018",NA,"10.1002/ecm.1299","WOS:000440407000011"

Coral reefs support a high diversity of marine organisms, among which rabbitfishes (family Siganidae) are a major component The present study aimed to reveal the mechanism that allows rabbitfishes to coexist on coral reefs in Okinawa, Japan, by investigating the spatial distributions, feeding ecologies, and behavioral interactions of four species: Siganus unimaculatus, S. virgatus, S. corallinus, and S. puellus. All four species had a size-specific spatial distribution, whereby small individuals were found in sheltered areas that were covered by branching and bottlebrush Acropora spp. and large individuals were found in both sheltered and exposed rocky areas. However, no clear species-specific spatial distribution was observed. There was some variation in the food items taken, with S. unimaculatus primarily feeding on brown foliose algae, red foliose algae, and red styloid algae, and S. virgatus and S. puellus preferring brown foliose algae and sponges, respectively. However, S. corallinus did not show any clear differences in food preferences from S. virgatus or S. unimaculatus, mainly feeding on brown foliose algae and red styloid algae. The four species exhibited differences in foraging substrate use, which was probably related to differences in their body shape characteristics: S. unimaculatus has a slender body with a remarkably protruding snout and mainly used concave substrates for feeding, whereas S. virgatus has a deeper body with a low degree of snout protrusion and mainly used convex substrates. The other two species have a low degree of snout protrusion combined with a deeper body in the case of S. corallinus and a slender body in the case of S. puellus and used concave, flat, and convex substrates to an equal degree for feeding. Behavioral interactions were categorized into agonistic behaviors (attack and agonistic displays) and no interactions. For all four species, a greater frequency of agonistic behaviors was observed when two conspecific pairs approached each other than when two heterospecific individuals encountered each other. Together, these results suggest that food item partitioning is one of the main factors enabling the coexistence of these four syntopic rabbitfish species, which is enhanced by species-specific differences in feeding substrates as a result of their different body shape and behavioral characteristics.","2018",NA,"10.7717/peerj.6145","WOS:000453929400010"
"Bartomeus, I; Godoy, O","Biotic controls of plant coexistence","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY","1. The quest for understanding the maintenance of species diversity has matured in recent decades under the umbrella of species coexistence theory, founded by Chesson (2000). The central conclusion of the theory is that coexistence at local scales depends on two opposing forces: average fitness differences between species, which drive the best-adapted species to exclude others, and stabilizing mechanisms, which promote diversity via niche differentiation. 2. Recent theoretical work has focussed on how interactions between plants and other organisms influence the equalizing and stabilizing forces. However, there is a lack of empirical information. Therefore, the next fundamental step is to assess the prevalence of these mechanisms for controlling plant coexistence across a wide range of interactions and systems. 3. To that end, this special feature presents 10 theoretical, observational, or manipulative studies illustrating 9 different biotic interactions including mutualisms (pollinators, seed dispersers, soil microbes, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) and antagonisms (leaf and seed herbivores, and leaf and root pathogens). All studies share a common question: how biotic interactions regulate plant coexistence? 4. Comparisons across studies suggest that biotic interactions modify both stabilizing and average fitness differences. In those cases where biotic interactions promote stable coexistence between plant species, both mutualistic and antagonistic interactions act more frequently as an equalizing rather than as a stabilizing mechanisms. 5. Besides these generalities, the studies of this special issue also present novel theoretical and empirical approaches to better understand the maintenance of species diversity over a wide variety of systems, environmental conditions, and organisms. 6. Synthesis. The studies presented here constitutes a solid base to empirically explore how mutualistic and antagonistic interactions act upon the determinants of plant species competition, and open novel paths for future research. Collectively, these advances will serve to pave the road for a better theoretical and empirical understanding of how biotic interactions control biodiversity.","2018",NA,"10.1111/1365-2745.13040","WOS:000452178600001"
"Veresoglou, SD; Rillig, MC; Johnson, D","Responsiveness of plants to mycorrhiza regulates coexistence","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY","1. Association of plants with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi may act as either an equalizing or a stabilizing mechanism of coexistence, but the effect of the symbiosis likely depends on the responsiveness to fungi of plant species within a community, rather than simply as a binary metric based on presence or absence of AM fungi. Here, we test the hypothesis that communities consisting of plants that are unresponsive to mycorrhiza, or that differ widely in their response to mycorrhiza, would exhibit larger differences in their niche and fitness resulting to weaker plant-plant competition. 2. We took two complementary approaches to test our hypotheses: first, we reanalysed data from the classic BIODEPTH grassland biodiversity manipulation experiment to assess niche and relative fitness differences of plant communities solely comprising species considered to be either obligate or facultative symbiotrophs. Second, we assembled replicate synthetic plant communities comprising all 70 possible four-species mixtures from a pool of eight species in the presence of an AM fungus to assess pairwise competition coefficients and infer coexistence potential. The species were characteristic of pastures, had an identical CSR survival strategy, and in nature differ in their extent of colonization by AM fungi. We separately established monocultures to estimate competition coefficients and assess plant responsiveness to mycorrhiza. 3. Analysis of data from BIODEPTH showed that plant communities comprising solely species with obligate associations with AM fungi had greater niche and fitness differences compared with communities comprising species without obligate associations with AM fungi. In the manipulation experiment, we found that plants that depended on AM fungi competed more strongly than plants with little dependence on AM fungi. The weakest competition was between AM-responsive and AM-unresponsive plant species. Coexistence was more likely in pairwise combinations in which at least one of the plant species responded negatively to mycorrhiza. 4. Synthesis. We directly quantified variation in niche and fitness differences between plant species due to interaction with AM fungi. Integrating this knowledge into explicit competition models in plant community ecology could greatly enhance our ability to predict coexistence in nature.","2018",NA,"10.1111/1365-2745.13026","WOS:000452178600009"

This spontaneous diversification often occurs amid a backdrop of directional selection on other microbial traits, where competitive exclusion would normally apply. Yet despite their empirical relevance, little is known about how diversification and directional selection combine to determine the ecological and evolutionary dynamics within a community. To address this gap, we introduce a simple, empirically motivated model of eco-evolutionary feedback based on the competition for substitutable resources. Individuals acquire heritable mutations that alter resource uptake rates, either by shifting metabolic effort between resources or by increasing the overall growth rate. While these constitutively beneficial mutations are trivially favored to invade, we show that the accumulated fitness differences can dramatically influence the ecological structure and evolutionary dynamics that emerge within the community. Competition between ecological diversification and ongoing fitness evolution leads to a state of diversification-selection balance, in which the number of extant ecotypes can be pinned below the maximum capacity of the ecosystem, while the ecotype frequencies and genealogies are constantly in flux. Interestingly, we find that fitness differences generate emergent selection pressures to shift metabolic effort toward resources with lower effective competition, even in saturated ecosystems. We argue that similar dynamical features should emerge in a wide range of models with a mixture of directional and diversifying selection.","2018",NA,"10.1073/pnas.1807530115","WOS:000448713200014"

We develop a simple model of competition between sensitive and resistant bacterial strains to predict the minimum selection concentration (MSC), the lowest level of antibiotic at which resistant bacteria are selected. We present an analytical solution for the MSC based on the routinely measured MIC, the selection coefficient (sc) that expresses fitness differences between strains, the intrinsic net growth rate, and the shape of the bacterial growth dose-response curve with antibiotic or metal exposure (the Hill coefficient [kappa]). We calibrated the model by optimizing the Hill coefficient to fit previously reported experimental growth rate difference data. The model fit varied among nine compound-taxon combinations examined but predicted the experimentally observed MSC/MIC ratio well (R-2 >= 0.95). The shape of the antibiotic response curve varied among compounds (0.7 <= kappa <= 10.5), with the steepest curve being found for the aminoglycosides streptomycin and kanamycin. The model was sensitive to this antibiotic response curve shape and to the sc, indicating the importance of fitness differences between strains for determining the MSC. The MSC can be >1 order of magnitude lower than the MIC, typically by the factor sc(kappa).

To what extent does viral fitness result from specific molecular interactions with host factors and regulatory networks during infection? Can we identify host genes in functional classes whose expression depends on viral fitness? Here, we compared the transcriptomes of tobacco plants infected with seven genotypes of tobacco etch potyvirus that differ in fitness. We found that the larger the fitness differences among genotypes, the more dissimilar the transcriptomic profiles are. Consistently, two different mutations, one in the viral RNA polymerase and another in the viral suppressor of RNA silencing, resulted in significantly similar gene expression profiles. Moreover, we identified host genes whose expression showed a significant correlation, positive or negative, with the virus' fitness. Differentially expressed genes which were positively correlated with viral fitness activate hormone- and RNA silencing-mediated pathways of plant defense. In contrast, those that were negatively correlated with fitness affect metabolism, reducing growth, and development.

We combined experiments and simulations in a system of nectar yeasts to quantify the relative contribution of the two mechanisms to coexistence. Resource competition models parameterized from single-species assays predicted the outcomes of mixed-culture competition experiments with 83% accuracy. Model simulations revealed that both mechanisms have measurable effects on coexistence and that relative nonlinearity can be equal or greater in magnitude to the temporal storage effect. In addition, we show that their effect on coexistence can be both antagonistic and complementary. These results falsify the common assumption that relative nonlinearity is of negligible importance, and in doing so reveal the importance of testing coexistence mechanisms in combination.","2018",NA,"10.1073/pnas.1801846115","WOS:000436245000076"

But how is this diversity maintained? Why do faster-growing variants not outcompete slower-growing variants, and erode this diversity? One hypothesis is if there are mutually beneficial interactions between variants, with host cells infected by multiple different viral genomes producing more, or more effective, virions. We modelled this hypothesis with both mathematical models and simulations, and found that moderate levels of beneficial coinfection can maintain high levels of coexistence, even when coinfection is relatively rare, and when there are significant fitness differences between competing variants. Rare variants are more likely to be coinfecting with a different variant, and hence beneficial coinfection increases the relative fitness of rare variants through negative frequency dependence, and maintains diversity. We further find that coexisting variants sometimes reach unequal frequencies, depending on the extent to which different variants benefit from coinfection, and the ratio of variants which leads to the most productive infected cells. These factors could help drive the evolution of defective interfering particles, and help to explain why the different segments of multipartite viruses persist at different equilibrium frequencies.","2018",NA,"10.1093/ve/vey028","WOS:000456426800010"

Coexistence and diversity in plant communities depend upon outcomes of plant competition. Competition and coexistence can be mediated by abiotic soil nutrient differences as well as by soil microbial communities. The latter effects occur through various mechanisms including negative plant-soil feedbacks, when plants foster the build-up of specialized pathogenic microbes, which ultimately reduce conspecific, but not heterospecific, densities. Microbial mutualists can have generalized associations with host plants, and by associating with multiple species might affect coexistence by conferring different levels of benefit to hosts. 2. We examined the effects of abiotic differences and soil microbial communities, including mutualistic nitrogen-fixing rhizobial bacteria, on coexistence processes and asked whether these interactions inform patterns of co-occurrence in natural communities. We measured plant-soil feedbacks in the greenhouse for three native Trifolium species that either highly co-occurred or were spatially repulsed at our field site. Using size-fractioned soil microbial inocula prepared from field-collected soils, we explored the effect of soil microbes on nodulation and the outcome of competition (relative interaction intensity). We also examined the effects of soil origin (home vs. away soil) on the outcome of competition between species. 3. Soil microbes had strong positive effects on plant growth and nodulation. Microbes in general reduced the strength of plant competition relative to competition in sterilized soil and altered the relative strength of interactions with conspecific vs. congeneric neighbours, which often occurred in ways predicted to enhance coexistence. In one pair of highly co-occurring Trifolium, competition was strong in sterilized soils, but these species facilitated one other in the presence of the full microbial community. The net effect of these microbes in general reduced competition while also increasing performance over that in sterilized soil, suggesting a role for soil microbial mutualists in host coexistence. 4.

To determine the substrate of selection, we asked whether selection on G + C content acts across all sites within a gene or is confined to particular genic regions or nucleotide positions. We systematically altered the G + C contents of the GFP gene and assayed its effects on the fitness of strains harboring each variant. Fitness differences were attributable to the base compositional variation in the terminal portion of the gene, suggesting a connection to the folding of a specific protein feature. Variants containing sequence features that are thought to result in rapid translation, such as low G + C content and high levels of codon adaptation, displayed highly reduced growth rates.

However, in nature, species with thousands of mating types are exceedingly rare. Several competing theories for the predominance of species with two mating types exist, yet they lack an explanation for how many are possible and in which species to expect high numbers. Here, we present a theoretical null model that explains the distribution of mating type numbers using just three biological parameters: mutation rate, population size and the rate of sex. If the number of mating types results from a mutation-extinction balance, the rate of sexual reproduction plays a crucial role. If sex is facultative and rare (a very common combination in isogamous species), mating type diversity will remain low. In this rare sex regime, small fitness differences between the mating types lead to more frequent extinctions, further lowering mating type diversity. We also show that the empirical literature supports the role of drift and facultativeness of sex as a determinant of mating type dynamics.","2018",NA,"10.1038/s41559-018-0580-9","WOS:000436927300026"

During respiratory growth under temperature and oxidative stress conditions, mitotype effects were largely independent of nuclear genotypes even in the presence of mito-nuclear interactions. Recombinant mtDNAs were generated to determine fitness components within high- and low-fitness mtDNAs. Based on phenotypic distributions of isogenic strains containing recombinant mtDNAs, we found that multiple loci contributed to mitotype fitness differences. These mitochondrial loci interacted in epistatic, nonadditive ways in certain environmental conditions. Mito-mito epistasis (i.e., nonadditive interactions between mitochondrial loci) influenced fitness in progeny from four different crosses, suggesting that mito-mito epistasis is a widespread phenomenon in yeast and other systems with recombining mtDNAs. Furthermore, we found that interruption of coadapted mito-mito interactions produced recombinant mtDNAs with lower fitness.

It is unclear whether these constraints cumulatively outweigh offspring fitness to determine oviposition decisions in wild populations. Understanding how constraints shape oviposition in natural landscapes is a critical step toward revealing how maternal behavior influences fundamental phenomena like the evolution of specialization and the use of sink environments. Here, we used a genetic capture-recapture technique to reconstruct the oviposition decisions of individual females in a natural metapopulation of a beetle (Bolitotherus cornutus) that oviposits on three fungus species. We measured larval fitness-related traits (mass, development time, survival) on each fungus and compared the oviposition preferences of females in laboratory versus field tests. Larval fitness differed substantially among fungi, and females preferred a high-quality (high larval fitness) fungus in laboratory trials. However, females frequently laid eggs on the lowest-quality fungus in the wild. They preferred high-quality fungi when moving between oviposition sites, but this preference disappeared as the distance between sites increased and was inconsistent between study plots. Our results suggest that constraints on oviposition preferences in natural landscapes are sufficiently large to drive oviposition in poor developmental environments even when offspring fitness consequences are severe.","2018",NA,"10.1086/696218","WOS:000428287200009"
"Verster, AJ; Borenstein, E","Competitive lottery-based assembly of selected clades in the human gut microbiome","MICROBIOME","BackgroundWhile the composition of the gut microbiome has now been well described by several large-scale studies, models that can account for the range of microbiome compositions that have been observed are still lacking. One model that has been well studied in macro communities and that could be useful for understanding microbiome assembly is the competitive lottery model. This model posits that groups of organisms from a regional pool of species are able to colonize the same niche and that the first species to arrive will take over the entire niche, excluding other group members.ResultsHere, we examined whether this model also plays a role in the assembly of the human gut microbiome, defining measures to identify groups of organisms whose distribution across samples conforms to the competitive lottery schema. Applying this model to multiple datasets with thousands of human gut microbiome samples, we identified several taxonomic groups that exhibit a lottery-like distribution, including the Akkermansia, Dialister, and Phascolarctobacterium genera. We validated that these groups exhibit lottery-like assembly in multiple independent microbiome datasets confirming that this assembly schema is universal and not cohort specific. Examining the distribution of species from these groups in the gut microbiome of developing infants, we found that the initial lottery winner can be replaced by a different member of the group. We further found that species from lottery-like groups tend to have fewer genes in their genomes, suggesting more specialized species that are less able to engage in niche differentiation.ConclusionsCombined, our findings highlight the complex and dynamic process through which microbial communities assemble and suggest that different phylogenetic groups may follow different models during this process.","2018",NA,"10.1186/s40168-018-0571-8","WOS:000447753000001"

Pathogenicity is itself a complicated trait underpinned by multiple complex traits, such as thermotolerance, morphology, and stress response. The baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is a species with broad environmental tolerance that has been increasingly reported as an opportunistic pathogen of humans. Here we leveraged the genetic resources available in yeast and a model insect species, the greater waxmoth Galleria mellonella, to provide a genome-wide analysis of pathogenicity factors. Using serial passaging experiments of genetically marked wild-type strains, a hybrid strain was identified as the most fit genotype across all replicates. To dissect the genetic basis for pathogenicity in the hybrid isolate, bulk segregant analysis was performed which revealed eight quantitative trait loci significantly differing between the two bulks with alleles from both parents contributing to pathogenicity. A second passaging experiment with a library of deletion mutants for most yeast genes identified a large number of mutations whose relative fitness differed in vivo vs. in vitro, including mutations in genes controlling cell wall integrity, mitochondrial function, and tyrosine metabolism. Yeast is presumably subjected to a massive assault by the innate insect immune system that leads to melanization of the host and to a large bottleneck in yeast population size. Our data support that resistance to the innate immune response of the insect is key to survival in the host and identifies shared genetic mechanisms between S. cerevisiae and other opportunistic fungal pathogens.","2018",NA,"10.1534/g3.117.300245","WOS:000419333800007"

We studied the optical properties in water of the valves of 3 pennate diatom species collected from an intertidal estuarine mudflat. We observed forward scattering of blue light in the valve, while the angle of incident white light at which this phenomenon was visible differed between the 3 tested raphid species. A slurry of oxidized frustules enhanced scalar irradiance in the blue spectral range by up to 120% compared to downwelling irradiance. Blue light induced higher relative electron transport rates at photosystem II and non-photochemical quenching compared to red actinic light.

We analyzed diversity and abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and beta-proteobacteria (AOB), nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB), and nitrification rates to identify their niche differentiation along a salinity gradient from the Pearl River estuary to the South China Sea. AOA were generally more abundant than beta-AOB; however, AOB more clearly attached to particles compared with AOA in the upper reaches of the Pearl River estuary. The NOB Nitrospira had higher abundances in the upper and middle reaches of the Pearl River estuary, while Nitrospina was dominant in the lower estuary. In addition, AOB and Nitrospira could be more active than AOA and Nitrospina since significantly positive correlations were observed between their gene abundance and the nitrification rate in the Pearl River estuary. There is a significant positive correlation between ammonia and nitrite oxidizer abundances in the hypoxic waters of the estuary, suggesting a possible coupling through metabolic interactions between them. Phylogenetic analysis further revealed that the AOA and NOB Nitrospina subgroups can be separated into different niches based on their adaptations to substrate levels. Water mass mixing is apparently crucial in regulating the distribution of nitrifiers from the estuary to open ocean. However, when eliminating water mass effect, the substrate availability and the nitrifiers' adaptations to substrate availability via their ecological strategies essentially determine their niche differentiation.","2018",NA,"10.5194/bg-15-5169-2018","WOS:000443077000001"

However, to date, it is not clear how the ecological niche differentiation of AOB and AOA are affected by land use and management changes in strongly acidic soils in subtropical China. In this study, three different land-use acidic soils - forest, upland, and paddy soils - were collected and a DNA Stable-Isotope Probing experiment performed to determine the relative contributions of AOA and AOB to ammonia oxidation in these soils. The results showed that AOA, but not AOB, amoA genes were detected in C-13-labelled DNA in the forest and paddy soils; however, only AOB amoA genes were detected in C-13-labelled DNA in the upland agricultural soils. The growth and activity of AOA and AOB in the different land-use soils provided direct evidence for the shift in roles for AOA and AOB in ammonia oxidation. AOA played the predominant role in ammonia oxidation in acidic forest and paddy soils. However, AOB, not AOA, mainly regulated the ammonia oxidation in acidic upland agricultural soils. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that AOA members within the marine Group1.1a-associated lineage dominated nitrification in the forest and paddy soils. Ammonia oxidation in the upland soil was catalysed by Nitrosospira cluster 3-like AOB. The moisture condition was likely the main reason inducing the ecological niche differentiation between upland and paddy soils; and AOA was more suitable for growth in the flooded, low oxygen conditions.","2018",NA,"10.1071/SR16356","WOS:000419096100007"

However, other less competitive ladybeetle species are not affected by the aphid's toxic trait.

We tested a set of widely invoked hypotheses about the extent of niche differentiation in one of the most diverse communities on Earth, decomposer microorganisms, by measuring their response to changes in three abundant litter resources: lignin, cellulose, and nitrogen (N). To do this, we used the model system Arabidopsis thaliana to manipulate lignin, cellulose, and N availability and then used high-throughput sequencing to measure the response of microbial communities during decay. Resequencing the decomposer communities after incubation of decomposed litter with pure substrates showed that groups of species had unique substrate use profiles, such that species organized into functional guilds of decomposers that were associated with individual litter chemicals. Low concentrations of lignin, cellulose, or N in the litter caused unique shifts in decomposer community composition after 1 yr of decay. Low cellulose plants had low levels of fungi in all decomposer guilds, low lignin plants had high levels of fungi in all decomposer guilds, and low N plants had low levels of fungi in decomposer guilds associated with sucrose and lignin. The relative abundance of decomposer guilds correlated with the total loss of individual litter chemicals during litter decay in the field. In addition, N fertilization shifted decomposer communities during both the early and later stages of decay to those dominated by decomposers in the cellulose guild. Our results contrast the assumption that major carbon (C) and N degradation mechanisms are uniform across whole decomposer communities and instead suggest that decomposition arises from complementarity among groups of metabolically distinct taxa.","2018",NA,"10.1002/ecm.1303","WOS:000440407000009"

Specifically, low temperatures could limit the generation of diversity, suggested by the observation that supply of genetic variation through immigration increased diversity at low, but not high temperatures. The two major determinants of mutation supply, population size and mutation rate, both showed a positive temperature dependence.

Using laboratory populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens, we examined whether shared evolutionary history affected the strength of priority effects. We hypothesized that sympatric evolution of populations belonging to the same guild would lead to niche differentiation, resulting in phenotypic complementarity that weakens priority effects. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that priority effects tended to be weaker in sympatrically evolved pairs of immigrating populations than in allopatrically evolved pairs. Furthermore, priority effects were weaker under higher phenotypic complementarity. However, these patterns were observed only in populations with a relatively short history of sympatric evolution, and disappeared when populations had evolved together for a long time.

However, the distribution of plant species and soils are highly variable even within a tropical region. This paper reviews existing and novel knowledge on soil genesis, plant and microbial physiology, and biogeochemistry. Typically, forests in Southeast Asia are dominated by dipterocarps growing on acidic Ultisols from relatively young parent material. In the Neotropics and Africa, forests contain abundant legume trees growing on Oxisols developed in the older parent materials on stable continental shields. In Southeast Asia, the removal of base cations from the surface soil due to leaching and uptake by dipterocarp trees result in intensive acidification and accumulation of exchangeable Al3+, which is toxic to most plants. Nutrient mining by ectomycorrhizal fungi and efficient allocation within tree organs can supply phosphorus (P) for reproduction (e.g., mast fruiting) even on P-limited soils. In the Neotropics and Africa, nitrogen (N) fixation by legume trees can ameliorate N or P limitation but excess N can promote acidification through nitrification. Biological weathering [e.g., plant silicon (Si) cycling] and leaching can lead to loss of Si from soil. The resulting accumulation of Al and Fe oxides in Oxisols that can reduce P solubility through sorption and lead to limitation of P relative to N.

While niche differentiation of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) driven by pH and nitrogen is well known, the patterns and environmental drivers of AOA and AOB community structure and activity across soil-sediment boundaries have not yet been determined. In this study, nitrification potential rate, community composition and transcriptional activity of AOA and AOB in soil, soil/sediment interface and sediments of two coastal Bays were characterized using a combination of field investigations and microcosm incubations. At DNA level, amoA gene abundances of AOA were significantly greater than AOB in soil, while in sediments AOB were significantly more abundant than AOA, but at the soil/sediment interface there were equal numbers of AOA and AOB amoA genes. Microcosm incubations provided further evidence, through qPCR and DGGE-sequencing analysis of amoA transcripts, that AOA were active in soil, AOB in sediment and both AOA and AOB were active at the soil/sediment interface. The AOA and AOB community composition shifted across the coastal soil-interface-sediment gradient with salinity and pH identified as major environmental drivers.","2018",NA,"10.1111/1462-2920.14238","WOS:000445184600012"

In the bacterivore nematode Litoditis marina species complex, which occurs associated with macro-algae, four cryptic lineages (Pm I-IV) co-occur in the field along the south-western coast and estuaries of The Netherlands. Here we investigate the temporal and/or spatial niche differentiation in their natural environment using a qPCR-based detection and relative quantification method. We collected different algal species (i.e. two Fucus species and Ulva sp.) and separated algal structures (i.e. receptacula, thalli, non-fertile tips and bladders) at different sampling months and times (i.e. twice per sampling month), to examine differences in microhabitat use between coexisting L. marina species. Results demonstrate that the cryptic species composition varied among different algal species and algal structures, which was also subject to temporal shifts. Pm I dominated on Fucus spp., Pm II showed dominance on Ulva sp., while Pm III overall had the lowest frequencies. Microhabitat partitioning was most pronounced between the two cryptic species which had similar microbiomes (Pm I and Pm II), and less so between the two species which had significantly different microbiomes (Pm I and Pm III), suggesting that species which share the same microhabitats may avoid competition through resource partitioning. The interplay of microhabitat differentiation and temporal dynamics among the cryptic species of L. marina implies that there is a complex interaction between biotic components and abiotic factors which contributes to their coexistence in the field.","2018",NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0204750","WOS:000445907400102"

By combining a microbiological and geochemical approach, we showed that the chemistry of the CO2- and CH4-rich gas reservoir hosted within the meromictic Lake Averno (Campi Flegrei, southern Italy) are related to the microbial niche differentiation along the vertical water column. The simultaneous occurrence of diverse functional groups of microbes operating under different conditions suggests that these habitats harbor complex microbial consortia that impact on the production and consumption of greenhouse gases. In the epilimnion, the activity of aerobic methanotrophic bacteria and photosynthetic biota, together with CO2 dissolution at relatively high pH, enhanced CO2- and CH4 consumption, which also occurred in the hypolimnion. Moreover, results from computations carried out to evaluate the dependence of the lake stability on the CO2/CH4 ratios, suggested that the water density vertical gradient was mainly controlled by salinity and temperature, whereas the effect of dissolved gases was minor, excepting if extremely high increases of CH4 are admitted. Therefore, biological processes, controlling the composition of CO2 and CH4, contributed to stabilize the lake stratification of the lake. Overall, Lake Averno, and supposedly the numerous worldwide distributed volcanic lakes having similar features (namely bio- activity lakes), acts as a sink for the CO2 supplied from the hydrothermal/magmatic system, displaying a significant influence on the local carbon budget.","2018",NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0193914","WOS:000426813200042"

Although a large part of the soil samples were found to be amoA-negative, bacterial amoA genes were detectable with new as well as old primer sets. The same results were obtained for the archaeal amoA genes. The relative distribution of archaeal and bacterial amoA genes varied between Andosol classes. Archaeal amoA genes were significantly more abundant in Brown than in Histic Andosols, while the opposite was observed for bacterial amoA genes. The numbers of archaeal and bacterial amoA genes in Gleyic Andosols were not significantly different from those in Histic and Brown Andosols. The numbers of bacterial amoA genes, but not the numbers of archaeal amoA genes, correlated significantly and positively with potential ammonia oxidation activities. The presence of the bacterial nitrification inhibitor allylthiourea inhibited the potential ammonia oxidation activities during the first 12 h of incubation.

We observed a clear difference of PCC compositions in spring and summer. All the lakes showed Bacillariophyta dominating in spring, whereas in summer, there were remarkable differences of PCC. Prokaryoplankton composition showed more pronounced differences in the vertical profile than those between spring and summer. The oligomictic lakes showed a uniform vertical gradient of prokaryotes in spring, while in the meromictic lakes, their abundances were incremented with depth. In summer, the prokaryotic community changed, and niche differentiation occurred in almost all lakes. In conclusion, our study showed a general pattern, common to all the lakes, of a first appearance of the large-sized opportunistic bacteria in spring, followed by ultramicrobacteria, less vulnerable to predation in summer. Significant correlations between a few PCC and bacterial groups were found, thus elucidating that functional interactions can be the key to understand plankton successions.","2018",NA,"10.1007/s10750-018-3586-z","WOS:000448578500004"

We report four new comammox Nitrospira genomes, constituting two novel species, and the first comparative genomic analysis on comammox Nitrospira. Unlike canonical Nitrospira, comammox Nitrospira genomes lack genes for assimilatory nitrite reduction, suggesting that they have lost the potential to use external nitrite nitrogen sources. By contrast, compared to canonical Nitrospira, comammox Nitrospira harbor a higher diversity of urea transporters and copper homeostasis genes and lack cyanate hydratase genes. Additionally, the two comammox clades differ in their ammonium uptake systems. Contrary to beta-AOB, comammox Nitrospira genomes have single copies of the two central ammonia oxidation pathway operons. Similar to ammonia oxidizing archaea and some oligotrophic AOB strains, they lack genes involved in nitric oxide reduction. Furthermore, comammox Nitrospira genomes encode genes that might allow efficient growth at low oxygen concentrations. Regarding the evolutionary history of comammox Nitrospira, our analyses indicate that several genes belonging to the ammonia oxidation pathway could have been laterally transferred from beta-AOB to comammox Nitrospira. We postulate that the absence of comammox genes in other sublineage II Nitrospira genomes is the result of subsequent loss.","2018",NA,"10.1038/s41396-018-0083-3","WOS:000436623600013"

The structure of their phytoplankton is therefore subjected to the interplay between the environmental conditions of the different zones (species sorting) and the strength of the unidirectional flow (mass effect). The spatial distribution of spring phytoplankton was investigated in a tropical reservoir across its different zones. Phytoplankton displayed heterogeneous spatial patterns from the turbulent, nutrient-rich riverine zones to the relatively stable lacustrine zone. The analysis of this spatial heterogeneity revealed the relative importance of species sorting and mass effect in this morphologically complex reservoir. Different taxonomic groups showed different spatial patterns due to their specific physiological and morphological features, and as a result of the local environmental filtering. In the studied reservoir, the strength of the homogenizing effect of water flow did not smooth the spatial heterogeneity and played a weak role in constraining spring phytoplankton. Actually, water flow contributed to the spatial heterogeneity of phytoplankton by enhancing the local environmental differences caused by an operational drop in water level, and species sorting resulted as the primary forcing in determining spring phytoplankton spatial distribution.","2018",NA,"10.1007/s10750-018-3651-7","WOS:000434373400008"

Primary occurrence data for three large, easily identified ciliate species, Parafavella gigantea, Schmidingerella serrata, and Zoothamnium pelagicum, and environmental data drawn from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's World Ocean Atlas were used to estimate each species' spatial and environmental distributions using Maxent v3.3.3k. The predictive power of the models was tested with a series of spatial stratification studies, which were evaluated using partial receiver operating characteristic (ROC) statistics. Differences between niches occupied by each taxon were evaluated using background similarity tests. All predictions showed significant ability to anticipate test points. The null hypotheses of niche similarity were rejected in all background similarity tests comparing the niches among the three species. This article provides the first quantitative assessment of environmental conditions associated with three species of ciliates and a first estimate of their spatial distributions in the North Atlantic, which can serve as a benchmark against which to document distributional shifts.

The ecological significance of diverse CO2 fixation strategies used by nitrifiers is, however, mostly unexplored. By analyzing autotrophy-related genes in combination with amoA marker genes based on droplet digitial PCR and CARD-FISH counts targeting rRNA, we quantified the distribution of nitrifiers in eight stratified lakes. Ammonia oxidizing (AO) Thaumarchaeota using the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate pathway dominated deep and oligotrophic lakes, whereas Nitrosomonas-related taxa employing the Calvin cycle were important AO bacteria in smaller lakes. The occurrence of nitrite oxidizing Nitrospira, assimilating CO2 with the reductive TCA cycle, was strongly correlated with the distribution of Thaumarchaeota. Recently discovered complete ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (comammox) belonging to Nitrospira accounted only for a very small fraction of ammonia oxidizers (AOs) present at the study sites. Altogether, this study gives a first insight on how physicochemical characteristics in lakes are associated to the distribution of nitrifying prokaryotes with different CO2 fixation strategies.

Here we reveal distinct postmortem microbiomes of human hosts from a large-scale survey of death cases representing a predominantly urban population, and demonstrated these microbiomes reflected antemortem health conditions within 24-48 hours of death. Our results characterized microbial community structure and predicted function from 188 cases representing a cross-section of an industrial-urban population. We found strong niche differentiation of anatomic habitat and microbial community turnover based on topographical distribution. Microbial community stability was documented up to two days after death. Additionally, we observed a positive relationship between cell motility and time since host death. Interestingly, we discovered evidence that microbial biodiversity is a predictor of antemortem host health condition (e.g., heart disease).

With the present review, we aim to summarize the effects of deadwood characteristics on the diversity and composition of saproxylic insects and fungi, with focus on European forests. We also discuss the influence of other biotic and abiotic components that indirectly affect these communities by altering wood continuity and variety. Niche differentiation is the main ecological driver of saproxylic organisms, as the presence of multiple microhabitats supports differently specialized taxa. The assemblage and richness of these saproxylic communities within forest ecosystems can be considered as indicators of climate-smart forestry trajectories.

Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase genes were over-represented at the surface, with PHA serving as a potential storage of fixed carbon. Sulfur metabolism genes were highly represented, in particular complete sets of genes responsible for both assimilatory and dissimilatory sulfate reduction. Pathways of environmental adaptation (UV, hypersalinity, oxidative stress, and heavy metal resistance) were also delineated, as well as putative viral defensive mechanisms (core genes of the CRISPR, BREX, and DISARM systems).

Functional metabolic genes related to nutrient cycling of nitrogen, sulfur, carbohydrates, iron and amino acids were differently distributed between the surface and deep waters of the WSP. Genes related to nitrogen metabolism were mainly found in deep waters, where Thaumarchaeaota, Sphingomonadales, and Pseudomonadales were closely associated and performing important roles in ammonia oxidation, assimilatory nitrate reduction, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction processes, respectively. In addition, orders affiliated to Spingobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria were crucial for sulfate reduction and abundant at 3000 m, whereas orders affiliated to Gammaproteobacteria, which harbored the most sulfate reduction genes, were abundant at 1000 m. Additionally, when compared with the East Kamchatka Current, the prokaryotes in the Oyashio Current were likely to consume more energy for synthesizing cellular components. Also, genes encoding iron transport and siderophore biosynthesis proteins were in low abundance, indicating that the iron was not a limiting factor in the Oyashio current. In contrast, in the East Kamchatka Current, prokaryotes were more likely to directly utilize the amino acids and absorb iron from the environment.

However, adaption and differentiation of AMF in response to commonly used fertilization remain poorly understood. In this study, we showed that the AMF community composition was primarily driven by soil physiochemical changes associated with chronic inorganic and organic fertilization of 37 years in Mollisols. High-throughput sequencing indicated that inorganic fertilizer negatively affected AMF diversity and richness, implying a reduction of mutualism in plant-AMF symbiosis; however, a reverse trend was observed for the application of inorganic fertilizer combined with manure. With regards to AMF community composition, order Glomerales was dominant, but varied significantly among different fertilization treatments. All fertilization treatments decreased family Glomeraceae and genus Funneli-formis, while Rhizophagus abundance increased. Plant-growth-promoting-microorganisms of family Claroideoglomer-aceae and genus Claroideoglomus were stimulated by manure application, and likely benefited pathogen suppression and phosphorus (P) acquisition. Family Gigasporaceae and genus Gigaspora were negatively correlated with available P in soil. Additionally, redundancy analysis further suggested that soil available P, organic matter and pH were the most important factors in shaping AMF community composition. These results provide strong evidence for niche differentiation of phylogenetically distinct AMF populations under different fertilization regimes. Manure likely contributes to restoration and maintenance of plant-AMF symbiosis, and the balanced fertilization would favor the growth of beneficial AMF communities as one optimized management in support of sustainable agriculture in Mollisols.","2018",NA,"10.1186/s13568-018-0587-2","WOS:000430222600001"

In soil food webs, detritivore animals occupy various trophic niches, spanning from primary decomposers to predators. However, the relative contribution of food resources and species attributes of consumers to gut microbial communities in soil detritivores has not yet been explored. In this study, we investigated gut bacteria and fungi of oribatid mites (Oribatida, Acari), ubiquitous and diverse soil microarthropods feeding on a variety of food resources, to uncover the contribution of host phylogenetic relatedness and trophic niches to the assemblages of gut microbiota. Abundance and community composition of bacteria and fungi were characterized by qPCR and Illumina sequencing, respectively. Gut bacterial communities were more closely correlated with host phylogenetic affinity, whereas gut fungal communities were more closely correlated with the trophic niches of the host. Community phylogenetic analysis suggests that deterministic processes predominated in the assembly of both bacterial and fungal communities in most of the studied oribatid mite species. Integrating phylogenetic distance and trophic niche distance of hosts resulted in the highest correlation coefficients between host species and their gut microbial communities suggesting that both evolutionary history and current trophic niches shape gut microbial communities. Bacteria in the gut may comprise commensals or mutualists facilitating digestion which potentially coevolved with the host, while the fungal community in the gut reflects the trophic niches of the consumer likely suggesting that they form part of the diet and serve as food resources of soil detritivore microarthropods.","2018",NA,"10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.05.011","WOS:000437392000020"

Fungal and bacterial endophytes are primarily acquired via contagious spread from the surrounding environment. The soil is an important reservoir for both fungal and bacterial endophytes; we term this a soil microbial bank and suggest that it functions similarly to a soil seed bank. Because most (similar to 75%) studies have found a strong positive relationship between plant diversity and soil microbial diversity, we predict that as plant diversity increases so will endophyte taxonomic and functional diversity. Once inside plant host tissues, endophytes can act as mutualists and increase plant performance directly by producing plant hormones, or indirectly by decreasing fungal or insect damage by up to 80%. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that there are costs associated with hosting beneficial endophytes for tropical trees. This is important because it challenges more traditional dichotomies (e.g., beneficial or deleterious) about endophytes and suggests that there are highly complex and context-dependent trade-offs and costs involved in plant-endophyte interactions. Though they comprise a cryptic component of tropical forests, plant-microbe interactions may typically regulate tree diversity, composition, and forest function at neighborhood and even regional scales. For example, pathogens may maintain tree diversity by reducing the fitness of common species in areas where plant host density is high or where hosts are close to reproductive conspecific adults. Moreover, plant-endophyte interactions, whether pathogenic or mutualistic, may comprise an entirely novel dimension of niche differentiation for coexisting tree species. Overall, tree endophytes in tropical forests are complex, yet critical drivers of forest dynamics and function.","2018",NA,"10.1007/978-3-319-89833-9_4","WOS:000459755500005"

The direction in which the vegetation shifts will co-determine whether Arctic warming is mitigated or accelerated, making the understanding of successional trajectories urgent. One of the key factors influencing the competitive relationships between plant species is their access to nutrients, depending on the depth where they take up most nutrients. However, nutrient uptake at different soil depths by tundra plant species that differ in rooting depth is unclear. LocationKytalyk Nature Reserve, northeast Siberia, Russia. MethodsWe injected N-15 to 5cm, 15cm and the thaw front of the soil in a moist tussock tundra. The absorption of N-15 by grasses, sedges, deciduous shrubs and evergreen shrubs from the three depths was compared. ResultsThe results clearly show a vertical differentiation of N uptake by these plant functional types, corresponding to their rooting strategy. Shallow-rooting dwarf shrubs were more capable of absorbing nutrients from the upper soil than from deeper soil. Deep-rooting grasses and sedges were more capable of absorbing nutrients from deeper soil than the dwarf shrubs. The natural N-15 abundances in control plants also indicate that graminoids can absorb more nutrients from the deeper soil than dwarf shrubs. ConclusionsOur results show that graminoids and shrubs in the Arctic differ in their N uptake strategies, with graminoids profiting from nutrients released at the thaw front, while shrubs mainly forage in upper soil layers.

As documented in previous reports, this midwater productivity hotspot is associated with prominent biomass peaks, consisting of prokaryoplankton (Bacteria + Archaea) protists and viruses. Early in the time-series, phylogenetic studies (small subunit ribosomal RNA gene libraries) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) surveys documented that the chemoautotrophic layer was overwhelmingly populated by c-proteobacteria related to sulfur-oxidizing symbionts from hydrothermal vent systems and beta-proteobacteria. However, after May 2009, beta- and epsilon-proteobacteria were no longer detected in significant numbers by FISH or by more exhaustive sequencing efforts (454 pyrosequencing and MiSeq iTag libraries). Sulfur oxidation gene quantification (qPCR) also confirmed that epsilon-proteobacteria were rare in samples collected after mid-2009 and that the chemoautotrophic layer became dominated by gamma-proteobacterial sulfur-oxidizers (GSOs). Monthly hydrographic and chemical data from the CARIACO Ocean Time-Series were examined for temporal changes that might have driven this shift in the dominant thioautotrophs. Within the redoxcline (250-450 m), significant shifts occurred in water density structure and distributions of H2S, NH4+, O-2, and NO2- between the beta-/epsilon-proteobacteria-dominated and the gamma-proteobacteria-dominated periods. Contrary to observations in other euxinic systems, GSO seem to have a selective advantage over other sulfur-oxidizing lieages during periods of higher and less variable H-2S vertical fluxes and higher relative fluxes of H2S to O-2 and NO3-. How exactly this changing seascape might have selected for one lineage over another cannot be directly determined. However, spatiotemporal variations in water density and concentration gradients altered vertical fluxes of the major reductant (H2S) and oxidants (O-2, NO3-,NO2-), which we postulate provided a more geochemically stable environment favoring GSOs.","2018",NA,"10.1016/j.dsr2.2017.11.016","WOS:000454184300010"

In a continuous cultivation system aiming at the planktonic calanoid Acartia tonsa an intruding harpacticoid frequently appears. We experimentally evaluate how the interaction from the semi-benthic Tisbe holothuriae is affecting our cultures and ask whether the two copepod-species are expected to pose competitive exclusion or co-exist long-term. This is pursued by establishing similar to 40days mono- and mixed copepod cultures reared in a stationary setup (S) theoretically advantageous for T.holothuriae and a rotating setup (R) with organisms kept in suspension by use of a plankton wheel, theoretically advantageous for A.tonsa. The carrying capacities of A.tonsa in either mono- or mixed cultures are not affected whether the copepods are subject to S or R treatment. Only exception is the S-setup containing mixed culture were A.tonsa obtains a significantly lower carrying capacity compared with A.tonsa alone in R-setup. The mono- and mixed cultures of T.holothuriae are, however, highly negatively affected by the R setup compared with S setup. A long-term solution to limit the presence of T.holothuriae is to apply turbulence level in a classical stagnant tank setup to an extend that suppress T.holothuriae and simultaneously allow algae in suspension as food for A.tonsa, make their eggs sediment as well as minimize risk of benthic-predation on eggs.","2018",NA,"10.1111/are.13581","WOS:000423800700015"

Although the host range for several species within the Francisella is known, little is known about the natural reservoirs of various Francisella species. The lack of knowledge regarding the environmental fates of these pathogens greatly reduces the possibilities for microbial risk assessments. The greater wax moth (Galleria mellonella) is an insect of the order Lepidoptera that has been used as an alternative model to study microbial infection during recent years. The aim of this study was to evaluate G. mellonella as a model system for studies of human pathogenic and closely related opportunistic and non-pathogenic strains within the Francisella genus. The employed G. mellonella larvae model demonstrated differences in lethality between human pathogenic and human non-pathogenic or opportunistic Francisella species. The F. novicida, F. hispaniensis and F. philomiragla strains were significantly more virulent in the G. mellonella model than the strains of human pathogens F. t. holarctica and F. t. tularensis. Our data show that G. mellonella is a possible in vivo model of insect immunity for studies of both opportunistic and virulent lineages of Francisella spp., that produces inverse results regarding lethality in G. mellonella and incapacitating disease in humans.

One important issue is to understand which processes are at the origin of observed aboveground overyielding in some mixed forests. We used a beech-maple plantation exhibiting aboveground overyielding to test whether belowground processes could explain this pattern. Soil cores were collected to determine fine root (FR) biomass and vertical distribution. Correlograms were used to detect spatial arrangement. Near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy was used to identify the tree species proportion in the FR samples and spatial root segregation. An isotopic approach was used to identify water acquisition patterns. The structure and the composition of the ectomycorrhizal fungal community were determined by high-throughput sequencing of DNA in the soil samples. We found no spatial pattern for FR biomass or for its vertical distribution along the gradients. No vertical root segregation was found, as FR density for both species decreased with depth in a similar way. The two species displayed similar vertical water acquisition profiles as well, mainly absorbing water from shallow soil layers; hence, niche differentiation for water acquisition was not highlighted here. Significant alterations in the fungal community compositions were detected in function of the percentage of maple in the vicinity of beech. Our findings do not support the commonly suggested drivers of aboveground overyielding in species-diverse forests and suggest that competition reduction or between-species facilitation of belowground resource acquisition may not explain the observed aboveground overyielding.","2018",NA,"10.1007/s00442-018-4278-0","WOS:000450471000021"

However, quantitative proxies for the determination of paleotemperatures are sparse. The relative abundances of certain bacterial lipids, i.e., branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs), respond to changes in environmental temperature, and thus have great potential for climate reconstruction. Their application to lake deposits, however, is hampered by the lack of fundamental knowledge on the ecology of brGDGT-producing microbes in lakes. Here, we show that brGDGTs are synthesized by multiple groups of bacteria thriving under contrasting redox regimes in a deep meromictic Swiss lake (Lake Lugano). This niche partitioning is evidenced by highly distinct brGDGT inventories in oxic vs. anoxic water masses, and corresponding vertical patterns in bacterial 16S rRNA gene abundances, implying that sedimentary brGDGT records are affected by temperature-independent changes in the community composition of their microbial producers. Furthermore, the stable carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) of brGDGTs in Lake Lugano and 34 other (peri-)Alpine lakes attests to the widespread heterotrophic incorporation of C-13-depleted, methane-derived biomass at the redox transition zone of mesotrophic to eutrophic lake systems. The brGDGTs produced under such hypoxic/methanotrophic conditions reflect near-bottom water temperatures, and are characterized by comparatively low delta(13)Cvalues. Depending on climate zone and water depth, lake sediment archives predominated by deeper water/low-C-13 brGDGTs may provide more reliable records of climate variability than those where brGDGTs derive from terrestrial and/or aquatic sources with distinct temperature imprints.","2018",NA,"10.1073/pnas.1805186115","WOS:000448040500052"
"Burson, A; Stomp, M; Greenwell, E; Grosse, J; Huisman, J","Competition for nutrients and light: testing advances in resource competition with a natural phytoplankton community","ECOLOGY","A key challenge in ecology is to understand how nutrients and light affect the biodiversity and community structure of phytoplankton and plant communities. According to resource competition models, ratios of limiting nutrients are major determinants of species composition. At high nutrient levels, however, species interactions may shift to competition for light, which might make nutrient ratios less relevant. The nutrient-load hypothesis merges these two perspectives, by extending the classic model of competition for two nutrients to include competition for light. Here, we test five key predictions of the nutrient-load hypothesis using multispecies competition experiments. A marine phytoplankton community sampled from the North Sea was inoculated in laboratory chemostats provided with different nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loads to induce either single resource limitation or co-limitation of N, P, and light. Four of the five predictions were validated by the experiments. In particular, different resource limitations favored the dominance of different species. Increasing nutrient loads caused changes in phytoplankton species composition, even if the N: P ratio of the nutrient loads remained constant, by shifting the species interactions from competition for nutrients to competition for light. In all treatments, small species became dominant whereas larger species were competitively excluded, supporting the common view that small cell size provides a competitive advantage under resource-limited conditions. Contrary to expectation, all treatments led to coexistence of diatoms, cyanobacteria and green algae, resulting in a higher diversity of species than predicted by theory. Because the coexisting species comprised three phyla with different photosynthetic pigments, we speculate that niche differentiation in the light spectrum might play a role. Our results show that mechanistic resource competition models that integrate nutrient-based and light-based approaches provide an important step forward to understand and predict how changing nutrient loads affect community composition.","2018",NA,"10.1002/ecy.2187","WOS:000431987600012"
"Shi, PJ; Gao, J; Song, ZP; Liu, YH; Hui, C","Spatial Segregation Facilitates the Coexistence of Tree Species in Temperate Forests","FORESTS","Competition between plants has an important role during the natural succession of forest communities. Niche separation between plants can reduce such interspecific competition and enable multispecies plant to achieve coexistence, although this proposition has rarely been supported in experiments. Plant competition can be captured by spatial segregation of the competing species to avoid fierce direct conflicts for nutrients and light. We investigated a site of 400 m x 1000 m in Beijing Pine Mountain National Nature Reserve that was established for protecting Chinese pine and some rare fungi. Six dominant tree species (Fraxinus chinensis Roxb., Syringa reticulata (Blume) H. Hara var. amurensis (Rupr.) J. S. Pringle, Quercus mongolica Fisch. ex Ledeb., Armeniaca sibirica (L.) Lam., Pinus tabuliformis Carriere, and Ulmus pumila L.) were individually marked. Metrics of spatial segregation, based on the theory of spatial point process, were calculated to detect spatial competition. The corresponding type (species)-specific probabilities and the p-values from a spatially implicit test revealed significant overall spatial segregation between the six tree species. We further used the cross-type L-function to check the spatial correlation between Chinese pine and the other tree species, and detected a significant spatial repulsion relationship with four other tree species. Our study shows that each of the six dominant tree species occupies a different subarea in the landscape to effectively reduce direct spatial competition. We thus argue that patchy distributions of different tree species could be common in late forest community succession, and the coexistence of plants could be maintained over a large spatial scale. Management intervention, such as thinning the densities of dominant tree species, could be used to foster species coexistence and ensure the productivity of commercial stands.","2018",NA,"10.3390/f9120768","WOS:000455069600040"

Here, we examine eight newly discovered seeps and two known seeps covering 800 km and varying across 2000 m water depth to identify: (1) novel megafaunal communities in this geographical region; (2) variations in the microbiome of seep habitats across the margin; (3) spatial and biogeochemical drivers of microbial diversity at seeps. In addition to authigenic carbonates, clam beds, microbial mats, and exposed hydrates - we also observed Siboglinidae tube worm bushes and an anomalous deep-sea barnacle adding to the overall habitats known from the NE Pacific. The microbial communities showed high variability in their spatial distribution and community structure. The seep communities formed distinct groups that included multiple groups of anaerobic methane oxidizing Archaea (ANME; 1, 2ab, 2c, and 3), often co-occurring within one site - however, there were also other sites with clearly dominant members (e.g. ANME-1s at Nehalem Bank). Sulfide oxidizers were dominated by the non-mat forming Campylobacterales and even though vertical gradients in redox potential typify seep sediments, in two cases there was not a significant change in community structure across the top five cm of sediment. We posit that these patterns were driven by 'bubble-turbation,' and bioirrigation by megafauna. A surprising latitudinal trend was observed in species diversity and richness with increasing richness significantly correlated to increasing latitude.

However, the question regarding how human gut microbiota adapts to varying lifestyles remains elusive. To understand the relationship between gut microbiota and urbanization, we compared the diversity, interaction and assembly of gut microbial communities of herdsmen from three regions with different levels of urbanization, namely traditional herdsmen (TH), semi-urban herdsmen (SUH) and urban herdsmen (UH). The relative abundance of Prevotella decreased with the degree of urbanization (from TH to UH), whereas that of Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, and Blautia showed an opposite trend. Although the alpha diversity measures (observed OTUs and phylogenetic diversity) of gut microbiota were unaffected by urbanization, the beta diversity (Jaccard or Bray-Curtis distances) was significantly influenced by urbanization. Metagenome prediction revealed that the gene functions associated with metabolism (i.e., carbohydrate and lipid metabolism) had significant differences between TH and UH. Network analysis showed that the modularity increased with the degree of urbanization, indicating a high extent of niche differentiation in UH. Meanwhile the trend of network density was opposite, indicating a more complex network in TH. Notably, the relative importance of environmental filtering that governed the community assembly increased with the degree of urbanization, which indicated that deterministic factors (e.g , low-fiber diet) play more important roles than stochastic factors (e.g., stochastic dispersal) in shaping the gut microbiota. A quantification of ecological processes showed a stronger signal of variable selection in UH than TH, implying that different selective pressures cause divergent gut community compositions due to urban lifestyles. Our results suggest that beta diversity, network interactions and ecological processes of gut microbiota may reflect the degree of urbanization, and highlight the adaptation of human gut microbiota to lifestyle changes.","2018",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2018.01745","WOS:000440311400001"

However, the potentially differential responses of these AO to substrate and temperature and the effects of conventional and organic nitrogen management on these responses remains poorly understood. We determined the response of nitrification to ammonium substrate concentration and temperature using an AOB specific inhibitor to distinguish the contribution of AOB and AOA to nitrification. Soils were sampled from cornfield plots that had been treated for four years with contrasting nitrogen sources: control (no additional N), ammonium sulfate at two rates and compost. Nitrification potential and net rates were stimulated for one month after fertilization with ammonium sulfate compared to relatively lower and stable rates in control and compost treated soils. For soils that had been fertilized with ammonium sulfate, the proportion of nitrification mediated by AOB in slurry assays was over 90% at 1.0 mM but less than 50% at 0.01 mM. Kinetic analysis showed maximum nitrification activity (V-max) for AOB ranged from 032 to 4.8 mmol N kg(-1)d(-1) with a half saturation constant (Km) of 14-160 mu M ammonium; parameters were higher for soils from ammonium sulfate treated plots. Vmax and Km for AOA averaged 0.24 mmol N kg(-1) d(-1) and 4.28 mu M ammonium with no effect of field treatment. The proportion of nitrification due to AOA was lowest at 5 degrees C, increased with temperature, and was near to 100% at 50 degrees C; optimum temperature was 41 degrees C for AOA versus 31 degrees C for AOB.

Such studies have focused mostly on soil communities, but more recently marine and extreme environments have also been explored, finding rare taxa and demonstrating dispersal limitation and biogeographic patterns for Streptomyces. To test the distribution of Actinobacteria populations on a small scale, we chose the extremely oligotrophic and biodiverse Cuatro Cienegas Basin (CCB), an endangered oasis in the Chihuahuan desert to assess the diversity and uniqueness of Actinobacteria in the Churince System with a culture-dependent approach over a period of three years, using nine selective media. The 16S rDNA of putative Actinobacteria were sequenced using both bacteria universal and phylum-specific primer pairs. Phylogenetic reconstructions were performed to analyze OTUs clustering and taxonomic identification of the isolates in an evolutionary context, using validated type species of Streptomyces from previously phylogenies as a reference. Rarefaction analysis for total Actinobacteria and for Streptomyces isolates were performed to estimate species' richness in the intermediate lagoon (IL) in the oligotrophic Churince system. A total of 350 morphologically and nutritionally diverse isolates were successfully cultured and characterized as members of the Phylum Actinobacteria. A total of 105 from the total isolates were successfully subcultured, processed for DNA extraction and 16S-rDNA sequenced. All strains belong to the order Actinomycetales, encompassing 11 genera of Actinobacteria; the genus Streptomyces was found to be the most abundant taxa in all the media tested throughout the 3-year sampling period. Phylogenetic analysis of our isolates and another 667 reference strains of the family Streptomycetaceae shows that our isolation effort produced 38 unique OTUs in six new monophyletic clades. This high biodiversity and uniqueness of Actinobacteria in an extreme oligotrophic environment, which has previously been reported for its diversity and endemicity, is a suggestive sign of microbial biogeography of Actinobacteria and it also represents an invaluable source of biological material for future ecological and bioprospecting studies.","2017",NA,"10.7717/peerj.3247","WOS:000400307400005"

A study was conducted to examine the contributions of AOA and AOB to nitrification, nitrite (NO2-) accumulation, and NO2--affected N2O production in three non-cropped Oregon soils. Nitrification potential rates in the three soils ranged seven-fold from 0.15 to 1.08 mu mol N g(-1) d(-1), with AOA contributing 64-71% of the total activity. AOA- and AOB-driven NO2- accumulation represented 8-100% of total NO2- + NO3- accumulation, persisted over 48 h, and was accompanied by acetylene-sensitive, ammonium-(NH4+) stimulated N2O production. Ammonium-and NOT-dependent N2O production occurred when both AOA and AOB, or AOA alone were active. By adding the NO2--oxidizing bacteria, Nitrobacter vulgaris, to soil slurries to increase NO2--oxidizing capacity, both NO2- accumulation and N2O production were prevented, while the overall rate of nitrification was unaffected. Yields of N2O-N amounted to 0.05 +/- 0.01% of total NO2- + NO3--N accumulation in the presence of supplemental NH4+, and 0.28 +/- 0.11% in the presence of both supplemental NH4+ + NO2-. Regression analysis of the N2O production against NO2- accumulation over 24 h revealed a positive, non-linear relationship for N2O production by both AOA plus AOB and by AOA alone. Values of V-max ranged 12-fold from 0.05 to 0.62 nmol N2O g(-1) d(-1), and predicted K-m values for NO2- ranged 15-fold from 0.02 to 0.30 smol NO2- g(-1) soil. These findings provide new insights into the impact of NO2- accumulation in soils on N2O production by both AOA and AOB, and show that NOT accumulation primarily drives N2O formation in these soils, and increases N2O yield by both AOA and AOB.

The physiology of nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) implies that the rates of nitrite oxidation should be controlled by concentration of their substrate, nitrite, and the terminal electron acceptor, oxygen. The sensitivities of nitrite oxidation to oxygen and nitrite concentrations were investigated using N-15 tracer incubations in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific. Nitrite stimulated nitrite oxidation under low in situ nitrite conditions, following Michaelis-Menten kinetics, indicating that nitrite was the limiting substrate. The nitrite half-saturation constant (K-s = 0.254 +/- 0.161 mu M) was 1-3 orders of magnitude lower than in cultivated NOB, indicating higher affinity of marine NOB for nitrite. The highest rates of nitrite oxidation were measured in the oxygen depleted zone (ODZ), and were partially inhibited by additions of oxygen. This oxygen sensitivity suggests that ODZ specialist NOB, adapted to low-oxygen conditions, are responsible for apparently anaerobic nitrite oxidation. Plain Language Summary Nitrite is a key intermediate in the biogeochemistry of low-oxygen marine environments, including the loss of fixed nitrogen as dinitrogen gas and nitrous oxide. Nitrate reduction to nitrite coupled to reoxidation of nitrite to nitrate has been proposed as a cycle that can preserve bioavailable nitrogen in oxygen minimum zones. This cycle implies that nitrite oxidation occurs in the absence, or near absence, of oxygen. Nitrite oxidation is considered to be an obligately aerobic process, although it has been reported from anoxic waters. Here we report on the regulation of nitrite oxidation by oxygen and nitrite in natural assemblages from the oxygen minimum zone of the Eastern Tropical North Pacific. We show that natural assemblages have very high affinity for nitrite and that oxygen actually inhibits nitrite oxidation in anoxic samples. These findings have implications for the marine nitrogen budget now and in future scenarios of changing ocean conditions.","2017",NA,"10.1002/2017GL074355","WOS:000408379000037"

Herbivores play a key role in shaping ecosystem structure and functions by influencing plant and microbial community composition and nutrient cycling. 2. This study investigated the long-term effects of herbivores on plant resource acquisition. We explored differences in the natural delta N-15 signatures in plant, microbial and soil N pools, and examined mycorrhizal colonization in two tundra sites that have been either lightly or heavily grazed by reindeer for more than 50 years. The study examined changes in nutrient acquisition in five common tundra plants with contrasting traits and mycorrhiza status; the mycorrhizal dwarf shrubs, Betula nana, Vaccinium myrtillus and Empetrum hermaphroditum; a mycorrhizal grass, Deschampsia flexuosa, and a non-mycorrhizal sedge, Carex bigelowii. 3. There were large variations in delta N-15 among coexisting plant species in the lightly grazed sites. This variation was dramatically reduced in the heavily grazed sites. At an individual species level, delta N-15 was higher in E. hermaphroditum and lower in C. bigelowii in the heavily grazed sites. Mycorrhizal colonization in B. nana and E. hermaphroditum roots were also lower in the heavily grazed sites. The delta N-15 signatures of the total soil N pool and of the microbial N pools were higher in the heavily grazed sites. 4. Since the strong delta N-15 differentiation among plant species has been interpreted as a result of plants with different mycorrhizal types using different sources of soil nitrogen, we suggest that the lower variation in delta N-15 in heavily grazed sites indicates a lower niche differentiation in nitrogen uptake among plants. Reduced mycorrhizamediated nitrogen uptake by some of the species, a shift towards a more mineral nutrition due to higher nutrient turnover, and uptake of labile nitrogen from dung and urine in the heavily grazed sites could all contribute to the changes in plant delta N-15. 5. We conclude that herbivores have the potential to influence plant nutrient uptake and provide the first data suggesting that herbivores decrease nutrient partitioning on the basis of chemical N forms among plant species. Reduced niche complementarity among species is potentially important for estimates of the effects of -herbivory on plant nutrient availability and species coexistence.","2017",NA,"10.1111/1365-2435.12917","WOS:000414248100003"

Anaerobic fungi play a primary role in the degradation of lignocellulosic plant material. They also have a syntrophic interaction with methanogenic archaea, which increases their fiber degradation activity. To date, nine anaerobic fungal genera have been described, with further novel taxonomic groupings known to exist based on culture-independent molecular surveys. However, the true extent of their diversity may be even more extensively underestimated as anaerobic fungi continue being discovered in yet unexplored gut and non -gut environments. Additionally many studies are now known to have used primers that provide incomplete coverage of the Neocallimastigomycota. For ecological studies the internal transcribed spacer 1 region (ITS1) has been the taxonomic marker of choice, but due to various limitations the large subunit rRNA (LSU) is now being increasingly used. How the continued expansion of our knowledge regarding anaerobic fungal diversity will impact on our understanding of their biology and ecological role remains unclear; particularly as it is becoming apparent that anaerobic fungi display niche differentiation. As a consequence, there is a need to move beyond the broad generalization of anaerobic fungi as fiber -degraders, and explore the fundamental differences that underpin their ability to exist in distinct ecological niches. Application of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics to their study in pure/mixed cultures and environmental samples will be invaluable in this process. To date the genomes and transcriptomes of several characterized anaerobic fungal isolates have been successfully generated. In contrast, the application of proteomics and metabolomics to anaerobic fungal analysis is still in its infancy. A central problem for all analyses, however, is the limited functional annotation of anaerobic fungal sequence data.

However, drivers of their abundances and distribution patterns remain unknown. Here, we examined abundance and distribution patterns for two DDA populations in relation to the Amazon River (AR) plume in the WTNA. Quantitative PCR assays, targeting two DDAs (het-1 and het-2) by their symbiont's nifH gene, served as input in a piecewise structural equation model (SEM). Collections were made during high (spring 2010) and low (fall 2011) flow discharges of the AR. The distributions of dissolved nutrients, chlorophyll-a, and DDAs showed coherent patterns indicative of areas influenced by the AR. A symbiotic Hemiaulus hauckii-Richelia (het-2) bloom (> 10(6) cells L-1) occurred during higher discharge of the AR and was coincident with mesohaline to oceanic (30-35) sea surface salinities (SSS), and regions devoid of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), low concentrations of both DIP (> 0.1 mu mol L-1) and Si (> 1.0 mu mol L-1). The Richelia (het-1) associated with Rhizosolenia was only present in 2010 and at lower densities (10-1.76 x 10(5) nifH copies L-1) than het-2 and limited to regions of oceanic SSS (> 36). The het-2 symbiont detected in 2011 was associated with H. membranaceus (> 10(3) nifH copies L-1) and were restricted to regions with mesohaline SSS (31.8-34.3), immeasurable DIN, moderate DIP (0.1-0.60 mu mol L-1) and higher Si (4.19-22.1 mu mol L-1). The piecewise SEM identified a profound direct negative effect of turbidity on the het-2 abundance in spring 2010, while DIP and water turbidity had a more positive influence in fall 2011, corroborating our observations of DDAs at subsurface maximas. We also found a striking difference in the influence of salinity on DDA symbionts suggesting a niche differentiation and preferences in oceanic and mesohaline salinities by het-1 and het-2, respectively. The use of the piecewise SEM to disentangle the complex and concomitant hydrography of the WTNA acting on two biogeochemically relevant populations was novel and underscores its use to predict conditions favoring abundance and distributions of microbial populations.","2017",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2017.00810","WOS:000401480300003"

The resultant carbonate structure is key for explaining their ecological success, as it provides protection against herbivores and resistance to water motion. However, its potential contribution to enhance thallus light absorption efficiency through multiple light scattering on algal skeleton, similar to the effect documented for scleractinian corals, has not been yet investigated. Here, we initiate this analysis, characterizing thallus optical properties of three coralline species, which differed in pigment content and thallus mass area (TMA, gDW m(-2)). The three species, the rhodolith Neogoniolithon sp., the crustose coralline alga (CCA), Lithothamnion sp., and the articulated alga Arnphiroa tribulus, represent the more distinctive coralline growth-forms and are able to colonize contrasting light environments in Caribbean coral reefs. The thicker thalli of the rhodoliths were the most efficient light collectors, as evidenced by their higher pigment absorption efficiency (a*(chia); m(2) mgChla(-1)) and photosynthetic rates per unit area. This could explain rhodolith success in oligotrophic, highly illuminated reef environments. In contrast, the thinner thalli of the CCA, a low-light specialist, showed the highest metabolic rates normalized to mass and the highest light absorption efficiencies per unit mass (a*(m); m(2) gdw(-1)). Therefore, the ecological success of the CCA in cryptic habitats within the reef cannot be explained only by its low-light physiology, but also by its capacity to reduce the structural costs of their thalli, and thus of its new growth. Lastly, the ecological success of Amphiroa tribulus, which displayed intermediate values for the efficiency of light absorption, metabolic rates and TMA, was explained by its ability to construct the largest light collectors (algal canopies) thanks to the presence of flexible, non-calcified segments (genicula). This ability enables enhanced photosynthetic and carbonate production at the organism/canopy level. The resulting fragile canopy survives best within the protection provided by colonies of the lettuce coral Agaricia agaricites. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the utility of optical traits as powerful tools to investigate differences in the competitive abilities, abundances and niche distribution among algal species and/or growth-forms.","2017",NA,"10.3389/fmars.2017.00297","WOS:000457690600295"

Anammox bacteria were normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk normality test, W-statistic = 0.954, p = 0.773) between 1 and 15 cm depth and were increased by a factor of 2.2 (p < 0.001) at 3 cm below the water-sediment interface when mussels were present. Amplicon sequencing of sediment at depths relevant to mussel burrowing (3 and 5 cm) showed that mussel presence reduced observed species richness (p = 0.005), Chao1 diversity (p = 0.005), and Shannon diversity (p < 0.001), with more pronounced decreases at 5 cm depth. A non-metric, multidimensional scaling model showed that intersample microbial species diversity varied as a function of mussel presence, indicating that sediment below mussels harbored distinct microbial communities. Mussel presence corresponded with a 4-fold decrease in a majority of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) classified in the phyla Gemmatimonadetes, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Plantomycetes, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Crenarcheota, and Verrucomicrobia. 38 OTUs in the phylum Nitrospirae were differentially abundant (p < 0.001) with mussels, resulting in an overall increase from 25% to 35%. Nitrogen (N)-cycle OTUs significantly impacted by mussels belonged to anammmox genus Candidatus Brocadia, ammonium oxidizing bacteria family Nitrosomonadaceae, ammonium oxidizing archaea genus Candidatus Nitrososphaera, nitrite oxidizing bacteria in genus Nitrospira, and nitrate- and nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidizing organisms in the archaeal family ANME-2d'' and bacterial phylum NC10'', respectively. Nitrosomonadaceae (0.9-fold (p < 0.001)) increased with mussels, while NC10 (2.1-fold (p < 0.001)), ANME-2d (1.8-fold (p < 0.001)), and Candidatus Nitrososphaera (1.5-fold (p < 0.001)) decreased with mussels. Co-occurrence of 2-fold increases in Candidatus Brocadia and Nitrospira in shallow sediments suggests that mussels may enhance microbial niches at the interface of oxic-anoxic conditions, presumably through biodeposition and burrowing. Furthermore, it is likely that the niches of Candidatus Nitrososphaera and nitrite-and nitrate-dependent anaerobic methane oxidizers were suppressed by mussel biodeposition and sediment aeration, as these phylotypes require low ammonium concentrations and anoxic conditions, respectively. As far as we know, this is the first study to characterize freshwater mussel impacts on microbial diversity and the vertical distribution of N-cycle microorganisms in upper Mississippi river sediment. These findings advance our understanding of ecosystem services provided by mussels and their impact on aquatic biogeochemical N-cycling.","2017",NA,"10.7717/peerj.3536","WOS:000406368900001"
"Martínez-García, R; Tarnita, CE","Seasonality can induce coexistence of multiple bet-hedging strategies in Dictyostelium discoideum via storage effect","JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY","The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum has been recently suggested as an example of bet-hedging in microbes. In the presence of resources, amoebae reproduce as unicellular organisms. Resource depletion, however, leads to a starvation phase in which the population splits between aggregators, which form a fruiting body made of a stalk and resistant spores, and non-aggregators, which remain as vegetative cells. Spores are favored when starvation periods are long, but vegetative cells can exploit resources in environments where food replenishes quickly. The investment in aggregators versus non-aggregators can therefore be understood as a bet-hedging strategy that evolves in response to stochastic starvation times. A genotype (or strategy) is defined by the balance between each type of cells. In this framework, if the ecological conditions on a patch are defined in terms of the mean starvation time (i.e. time between the onset of starvation and the arrival of a new food pulse), a single genotype dominates each environment, which is inconsistent with the huge genetic diversity observed in nature. Here we investigate whether seasonality, represented by a periodic, wet-dry alternation in the mean starvation times, allows the coexistence of several strategies in a single patch. We study this question in a non-spatial (well-mixed) setting in which different strains compete for a common pool of resources over a sequence of growth starvation cycles. We find that seasonality induces a temporal storage effect that can promote the stable coexistence of multiple genotypes. Two conditions need to be met in our model. First, there has to be a temporal niche partitioning (two well-differentiated habitats within the year), which requires not only different mean starvation times between seasons but also low variance within each season. Second, each season's well-adapted strain has to grow and create a large enough population that permits its survival during the subsequent unfavorable season, which requires the number of growth-starvation cycles within each season to be sufficiently large. These conditions allow the coexistence of two bet-hedging strategies. Additional tradeoffs among life-history traits can expand the range of coexistence and increase the number of coexisting strategies, contributing toward explaining the genetic diversity observed in D. discoideum. Although focused on this cellular slime mold, our results are general and may be easily extended to other microbes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

An important emerging application of Tn-Seq is for identifying genetic interactions, which involves comparing Tn mutant libraries generated in different genetic backgrounds (e.g. wild-type strain versus knockout strain). Several analytical methods have been proposed for analyzing Tn-Seq data to identify genetic interactions, including estimating relative fitness ratios and fitting a generalized linear model. However, these have limitations which necessitate an improved approach. We present a hierarchical Bayesian method for identifying genetic interactions through quantifying the statistical significance of changes in enrichment. The analysis involves a four-way comparison of insertion counts across datasets to identify transposon mutants that differentially affect bacterial fitness depending on genetic background. Our approach was applied to Tn-Seq libraries made in isogenic strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis lacking three different genes of unknown function previously shown to be necessary for optimal fitness during infection. By analyzing the libraries subjected to selection inmice, we were able to distinguish several distinct classes of genetic interactions for each target gene that shed light on their functions and roles during infection.","2017",NA,"10.1093/nar/gkx128","WOS:000403693000001"

Soybean sprout demand has been supplied by natto (a Japanese soyfood) cultivars that share some seed characteristics with sprout cultivars. However, natto seeds do not meet all requirements of sprouts and are rejected by sprout manufacturers. The objectives of this study were to evaluate important seed and sprout traits as potential selection criteria in breeding sprout soybeans and to study the storage effect on soybean sprout quality. Almost all genotypes produced thicker and longer hypocotyls and higher fresh-sprouts than 'MFS-561', a commercial soybean sprout variety. Hypocotyl length ranged from 13.8 to 16.2 cm. Four fungi genera Bipolaris sp., Cercospora sp., Botrytis sp. and Caethomium sp. were isolated from seeds. Cracked cotyledons and abnormal seedlings were the two main constraints affecting soybean sprout quality. Correlation coefficients among all traits indicated that percentage and weight of high-and average-quality sprouts would determine sprout yield. Acceptable yield and several traits were recommended to be used simultaneously while breeding superior sprout soybean cultivars. Good sprout varieties should produce high-quality sprouts [48%, average-quality sprouts <38%, low-quality sprouts <14%, sprout yield >5.7 g/g seed, hypocotyl thickness >1.6 cm and hypocotyl length >13 cm. One-year seed storage at room temperature reduced sprout quality. V09-3876 and V12-1939 had superior seed and sprout traits and are promising lines for further evaluation for sprout production.

SA + MAP was the most effective treatment with the lowest weight loss and decay incidence, the greatest rachis chlorophyll content and berry detachment force at the end of 60 d storage. Effects of SA were also very close to those obtained by the combined treatment. SA alone or SA + MAP treatment may be recommended as an environmental friendly, healthy and sustainable method for extending postharvest quality of grapes up to 60 d, without significant adverse effect on produces.

We propose that development and optimization of microbiome treatments will benefit from the integration of ecological and evolutionary niche theory into plant microbiome studies. Thus, we review several niche-based processes that can aid in the development and implementation of microbiome treatments. Current predictive approaches include evolutionary history, habitat origin, ecological traits, resource trade, and gene signatures, none of which are mutually exclusive. A robust predictive framework must further account for observed plasticity and context dependence in microbial function. Development of microbiome treatments that will successfully establish in the field can also benefit from a better understanding of niche-based processes such as niche partitioning to limit competitive interactions and maximize persistence, priority effects to allow establishment before resident taxa, storage effects that take advantage of temporal variation in niche availability, and local adaptation to specific environments. Using endophytic fungi as examples, we illustrate current knowledge and gaps in these areas.

Samples were collected every 90 days for 15 months at eight farms, four pig, and four dairy farms, four of them having a biogas plant. Moreover, to evaluate storage effects on samples, 20 l of manure and slurry taken at each farm (digested manure only in farms with a biogas plant) were stored in a controlled climatic chamber at 18 degrees C, for 6 months. The bacterial load and the chemical-physical characteristics of excreta were evaluated at each sampling time, stored slurry, and manure were sampled and analyzed every 2 months. A high variability of the concentration of bacteria in the different excreta types was observed during the experiment, mainly depending on the type and time of treatment. No sample revealed either the presence of Escherichia coli O157:H7 or of Salmonella, usually linked to the temporary rearing of infected animals in facilities. Anaerobic digestion and storage affected in a significant way the reduction of indicator bacteria like lactobacilli, coliforms, and streptococci. Anaerobic digestion lowered coliforms in pig slurry (- 2.80 log, P < 0.05), streptococci in dairy manure (- 2.44 log, P < 0.001) and in pig slurry (- 1.43 log, P < 0.05), and lactobacilli in pig slurry (- 3.03 log, P < 0.05).

Multiple dynamic growth and survival curves obtained under different fluctuating temperature conditions between 4 and 35 degrees C were used to determine the growth kinetics of SPA. In combination with appropriate secondary models, the study examined both growth and survival of SPA simultaneously by an integrated one-step approach using a set of differential equations. The estimated minimum growth temperature (T-min) of SPA was 8.91 degrees C, matching well with the growth characteristics of this microorganism. The growth at temperatures above T-min and the survival below T-min was accurately simulated by the predictive models. For model development, the root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.26 log CFU/g. The predictive models and kinetic parameters were validated using two dynamic growth and survival curves along with one isothermal thermal growth curve. The validation also showed that the models were accurate in predicting the growth and survival of the bacterium, With the RMSE of predictions only 0.52 log CFU/g. The errors of predictions were within normal experimental errors. The results of this work may be used to predict the change in the population of SPA in the marinated roasted chickens in the cold chain and during temperature abuse and to conduct risk assessment of this pathogen.

The demands for specialized sample storage equipment, chemicals and standardized protocols for nucleic acid extraction often require sample processing in a home laboratory that can be continents apart from sampling sites. Standard sampling procedures, especially when dealing with RNA, comprise immediate snap freezing of soils in liquid nitrogen and storage at - 80 degrees C until further processing. For these instances, organizing a reliable cooling chain to transport hundreds of soil samples between continents is very costly, if possible at all. In this study we tested the effect of soil sample preservation by freeze-drying with subsequent short-term storage at 4 degrees C or ambient temperatures compared to -80 degrees C freezing by comparative barcoding analyses of soil microbial communities. Methods Two grassland soil samples were collected in Central Germany in the Biodiversity Exploratory Hainich-Dun. Samples were freeze-dried or stored at -80 degrees C as controls. Freeze-dried samples were stored at 4 degrees C or ambient temperature. Investigated storage times for both storage temperatures were 1 and 7 days.

We previously showed that two co-occurring Rumex species exhibit negative pairwise plant-soil feedbacks, predicting that plant-soil feedbacks could lead to their coexistence. However, whether plants are able to reproduce when at an establishment disadvantage (invasibility), or what drivers in the soil might correlate with this pattern, are unknown. To address these questions, we created experimental plots with heterogeneous and homogeneous soils using field-collected conditioned soils from each of these Rumex species. We then allowed resident plants of each species to establish and added invader seeds of the congener to evaluate invasibility. Rumex congeners were mutually invasible, in that both species were able to establish and reproduce in the other's resident population. Invaders of both species had twice as much reproduction in heterogeneous compared to homogeneous soils; thus the spatial arrangement of plant-soil feedbacks may influence coexistence. Soil mixing had a non-additive effect on the soil bacterial and fungal communities, soil moisture, and phosphorous availability, suggesting that disturbance could dramatically alter soil legacy effects. Because the spatial arrangement of soil patches has coexistence implications, plant-soil feedback studies should move beyond studies of mean effects of single patch types, to consider how the spatial arrangement of patches in the field influences plant communities.","2017",NA,"10.1007/s00442-017-3828-1","WOS:000398563100015"

We then explored how the phytoplankton assembly is structured by deterministic or stochastic processes, where the former process is typically represented using the traditional niche theory and the latter process is highlighted using the neutral theory. Because we used eddy-resolving resolution, phytoplankton dispersion and the resultant dispersal limitation were explicitly represented, where the dispersal limitation prevents the most competitive species from using its appropriate niche and subsequently enhances stochastic effects. In the simulation results, all surviving species have an oceanic volume in which the phytoplankton species has the highest specific growth rate in all the 240 species. The abundance in the most competitive space has a strong, positive correlation with the relative species abundance. Moreover, of the phytoplankton types whose abundances in the most competitive space are nearly equal, the survival of a species is affected by its residence time within its habitat; the surviving phytoplankton species tend to have larger residence times compared to the non-persistent species. These results led us to conclude that deterministic processes had significant contributions to a formation of phytoplankton assembly. This was supported by the result that a structure of phytoplankton assembly represented by species rank in abundance was invariant with time and hardly dependent on initial conditions of phytoplankton composition.

While their ecological relevance is acknowledged, increasing resolution in molecular techniques allows disentangling cyanobacteria's role at the micro-scale, where complex microbial interactions may drive the overall community assembly. The interplay between phylogenetically different Synechococcus clades and their associated bacterial communities can affect their ecological fate and susceptibility to protistan predation. In this study, we experimentally promoted different levels of ecological interaction by mixing two Synechococcus ribotypes (MW101C3 and LL) and their associated bacteria, with and without a nanoflagellate grazer (Poterioochromonas sp.) in laboratory cultures. The beta-diversity of the Synechococcus-associated microbiome in laboratory cultures indicated that the presence of the LL ribotype was the main factor determining community composition changes (41% of total variance), and prevailed over the effect of protistan predation (18% of total variance). Our outcomes also showed that species coexistence and predation may promote microbial diversity, thus highlighting the underrated ecological relevance of such micro-scale factors.","2017",NA,"10.1111/jpy.12583","WOS:000417204400004"

Understanding species coexistence and regulation of biodiversity are major research challenges, yet there is no consensus on the effects of diversity on diversity, including their mediation through plant-plant interactions. 2. We examined how the diversity of recipient communities impacted on the establishment of colonising species. We ran a greenhouse-based community experiment, creating artificial arable crop communities with varying levels of barley genotype and weed species diversity, analysed with structural equation modelling of responses across trophic levels. 3. Colonising arable weed species establishment was significantly reduced when the recipient communities' weed species richness, but not barley genotype richness, increased. Recipient plant communities with higher species richness occupied more total niche space and showed stronger competition with colonising species. In contrast, recipient plant communities with higher genotype richness, even though they had slightly greater niche space occupancy, had no significant effects on the colonisation of additional species. 4. Responses were species specific: colonising common weed species establishment was less affected by the recipient plant communities than that of colonising rare weed species. Strong responses of colonising rare species were related to the abiotic rather than the biotic environment created by the recipient communities. The stronger response of colonising rare species suggests greater niche overlap with and competitive inferiority to the recipient plant community, whereas the relative independence of colonising common species indicates less niche overlap and/or competitive equality or superiority. 5. We observed a negative species diversity effect on colonising species, with the effect size increasing with increasing rarity of the colonising species. This differential responsiveness of colonising rare and common arable weed species to the presence of and diversity in the recipient arable plant communities may be crucial in understanding rarity and may result from differential evolutionary pathways in response to interactions.","2017",NA,"10.1111/1365-2435.12848","WOS:000404860200011"

However, the effects of Streptomyces on, and their responses to, coexisting microorganisms as a function of plant host or plant species richness have received little attention. In this work, we characterized antagonistic activities and nutrient use among Streptomyces and Fusarium from the rhizosphere of Andropogon gerardii (Ag) and Lespedeza capitata (Lc) plants growing in communities of 1 (monoculture) or 16 (polyculture) plant species. Streptomyces from monoculture were more antagonistic against Fusarium than those from polyculture. In contrast, Fusarium isolates from polyculture had greater inhibitory capacities against Streptomyces than isolates from monoculture. Although Fusarium isolates had on average greater niche widths, the collection of Streptomyces isolates in total used a greater diversity of nutrients for growth. Plant richness, but not plant host, influenced the potential for resource competition between the two taxa. Fusarium isolates had greater niche overlap with Streptomyces in monoculture than polyculture, suggesting greater potential for Fusarium to competitively challenge Streptomyces in monoculture plant communities. In contrast, Streptomyces had greater niche overlap with Fusarium in polyculture than monoculture, suggesting that Fusarium experiences greater resource competition with Streptomyces in polyculture than monoculture. These patterns of competitive and inhibitory phenotypes among Streptomyces and Fusarium populations are consistent with selection for Fusarium-antagonistic Streptomyces populations in the presence of strong Fusarium resource competition in plant monocultures. Similarly, these results suggest selection for Streptomyces-inhibitory Fusarium populations in the presence of strong Streptomyces resource competition in more diverse plant communities. Thus, landscape-scale variation in plant species richness may be critical to mediating the coevolutionary dynamics and selective trajectories for inhibitory and nutrient use phenotypes among Streptomyces and Fusarium populations in soil, with significant implications for microbial community functional characteristics.","2017",NA,"10.1007/s00248-016-0907-5","WOS:000403255500015"
"Leibold, MA; Hall, SR; Smith, VH; Lytle, DA","Herbivory enhances the diversity of primary producers in pond ecosystems","ECOLOGY","Diversity of primary producer is often surprisingly high, despite few limiting factors such as nutrients and light to facilitate species coexistence. In theory, the presence of herbivores could increase the diversity of primary producers, resolving this paradox of the plankton. Little experimental evidence supports this natural enemies hypothesis, but previous tests suffer from several deficiencies. Previous experiments often did not allow for multigeneration effects; utilized low diversity assemblages of herbivores; and limited opportunities for new primary producer and herbivore species to colonize and undergo species sorting that favors some species over others. Using pond plankton, we designed a mesocosm experiment that overcame these problems by allowing more time for interactions over multiple generations, openness to allow new colonists, and manipulated higher diversity of primary producers and grazers than have previous studies. With this design, the presence of zooplankton grazers doubled phytoplankton richness. The additional phytoplankton species in grazed mesocosms were larger, and therefore likely more grazer resistant. Furthermore, phytoplankton richness in grazed mesocosms was similar to that observed in natural ponds whereas it was much lower in mesocosms without grazers. However, stoichiometric imbalance caused by variation in nitrogen : phosphorus ratios and light supply did not alter phytoplankton richness. Therefore, grazers enhanced primary producer richness more strongly than ratios of nutrient supply (even though both grazing and ratios of resource supply altered composition of primary producer assemblages). Taken together, these experimental and field data show that grazing from a diverse assemblage of herbivores greatly elevated richness of phytoplankton producers in pond ecosystems.","2017",NA,"10.1002/ecy.1636","WOS:000391862900005"
"Gomes, SIF; Merckx, VSFT; Saavedra, S","Fungal-host diversity among mycoheterotrophic plants increases proportionally to their fungal-host overlap","ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","The vast majority of plants obtain an important proportion of vital resources from soil through mycorrhizal fungi. Generally, this happens in exchange of photosynthetically fixed carbon, but occasionally the interaction is mycoheterotrophic, and plants obtain carbon from mycorrhizal fungi. This process results in an antagonistic interaction between mycoheterotrophic plants and their fungal hosts. Importantly, the fungal-host diversity available for plants is restricted as mycoheterotrophic interactions often involve narrow lineages of fungal hosts. Unfortunately, little is known whether fungal-host diversity may be additionally modulated by plant-plant interactions through shared hosts. Yet, this may have important implications for plant competition and coexistence. Here, we use DNA sequencing data to investigate the interaction patterns between mycoheterotrophic plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. We find no phylogenetic signal on the number of fungal hosts nor on the fungal hosts shared among mycoheterotrophic plants. However, we observe a potential trend toward increased phylogenetic diversity of fungal hosts among mycoheterotrophic plants with increasing overlap in their fungal hosts. While these patterns remain for groups of plants regardless of location, we do find higher levels of overlap and diversity among plants from the same location. These findings suggest that species coexistence cannot be fully understood without attention to the two sides of ecological interactions.","2017",NA,"10.1002/ece3.2974","WOS:000402554700032"

The Daly River supports a high diversity of freshwater turtles, making it the ideal place to study a freshwater turtle community. Aims To determine the dry-season diet and microhabitat use of Carettochelys insculpta, Elseya dentata, Chelodina oblonga, Emydura victoriae and Emydura subglobosa worrelli and examine intraspecific and interspecific niche overlap and ontogenetic dietary shift. Methods Gut contents were collected by stomach flushing, and microhabitat use was determined by recording where each turtle was first seen before capture. Diet and microhabitat use were compared using an index of relative importance. Niche overlap was measured with Horn's overlap index. Key resultsCarettochelys insculpta is an opportunistic omnivore that feeds mostly on ribbonweed (Vallisneria spiralis) and aquatic snails. Elseya dentata is herbivorous, feeding primarily on aquatic algae. The diets of C. insculpta and E. dentata overlapped moderately, but the overall niche overlap was low because they occupied different microhabitats within the river. Chelodina oblonga fed very little, and may use the Daly River as a dry-season refuge. Emydura victoriae is molluscivorous, consuming more molluscs as it grows. This ontogenetic dietary shift was associated with megacephaly (extreme broadly expanded head that is too large to fit into the carapace) and expanded triturating surfaces. This specialisation allows adult E. victoriae to feed exclusively on molluscs and so their diet overlapped little with other species. Emydura subglobosa worrelli was omnivorous, consuming mostly freshwater sponge and apparently preferring more lentic water. Conclusions The freshwater turtles of the wet-dry tropics are usually reported as being heavily reliant on the seeds, fruits and leaves of riparian vegetation; however, the present study showed that the dry-season diet in perennial rivers is primarily of aquatic origin. Implications The study suggested that populations of C. insculpta, E. dentata and E. victoriae could be threatened by broad-scale development in northern Australia if there were substantive impacts on aquatic macrophytes and molluscs in the Daly River system.","2017",NA,"10.1071/WR16202","WOS:000406365400005"
"Ehrlich, E; Becks, L; Gaedke, U","Trait-fitness relationships determine how trade-off shapes affect species coexistence","ECOLOGY","Trade-offs between functional traits are ubiquitous in nature and can promote species coexistence depending on their shape. Classic theory predicts that convex trade-offs facilitate coexistence of specialized species with extreme trait values (extreme species) while concave trade-offs promote species with intermediate trait values (intermediate species). We show here that this prediction becomes insufficient when the traits translate non-linearly into fitness which frequently occurs in nature, e.g., an increasing length of spines reduces grazing losses only up to a certain threshold resulting in a saturating or sigmoid trait-fitness function. We present a novel, general approach to evaluate the effect of different trade-off shapes on species coexistence. We compare the trade-off curve to the invasion boundary of an intermediate species invading the two extreme species. At this boundary, the invasion fitness is zero. Thus, it separates trait combinations where invasion is or is not possible. The invasion boundary is calculated based on measurable trait-fitness relationships. If at least one of these relationships is not linear, the invasion boundary becomes non-linear, implying that convex and concave trade-offs not necessarily lead to different coexistence patterns. Therefore, we suggest a new ecological classification of trade-offs into extreme-favoring and intermediate-favoring which differs from a purely mathematical description of their shape. We apply our approach to a well-established model of an empirical predator-prey system with competing prey types facing a trade-off between edibility and half-saturation constant for nutrient uptake. We show that the survival of the intermediate prey depends on the convexity of the trade-off. Overall, our approach provides a general tool to make a priori predictions on the outcome of competition among species facing a common trade-off in dependence of the shape of the trade-off and the shape of the trait-fitness relationships.","2017",NA,"10.1002/ecy.2047","WOS:000416863500019"

Fungal interactions may result in additive effects on the host plant, which could be predicted simply based on individual fungal behavior. Alternatively, interactions among fungi may result in non-additive synergistic or antagonistic effects on plant performance that are more challenging to predict. Here, we hypothesized that the effects of fungal interactions on the plant host could be predicted from their niche overlap. To test this idea, we used foliar fungal endophytes with a range of niche overlap based on trait dissimilarities to examine the effects of six fungal species pairs compared to the corresponding individual fungal species on switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) in water-stressed and well-watered conditions. Mixtures of endophytes had either no effect or predictable, additive effects on plant tiller number, but effects on plant growth rate and wilting were largely nonadditive. Moisture level, fungal stress, and metabolic trait dissimilarity predicted 51 to 92% of the deviation of fungal effects from additive, with less similar fungi likely to have more synergistic effects on the plant host. Furthermore, we identified indicator metabolites for fungal interaction outcomes. However, the effects of endophyte interactions on the plant host were environment dependent making single community applications more challenging. Overall, future development of microbial tools for use in agriculture must consider their interactions to optimize application.","2017",NA,"10.2134/agronj2016.10.0568","WOS:000404383500017"

Here, we apply a novel extension of this framework to microbiota associated with aboveground tissues, termed 'plant-phyllosphere feedback (PPFs)'. In parallel greenhouse experiments, rhizosphere and phyllosphere microbiota of con-and heterospecific hosts from four species were independently manipulated. In a third experiment, we tested the combined effects of soil and phyllosphere feedback under field conditions. We found that three of four species experienced weak negative PSF whereas, in contrast, all four species experienced strong negative PPFs. Field-based feedback estimates were highly negative for all four species, though variable in magnitude. Our results suggest that phyllosphere microbiota, like rhizosphere microbiota, can potentially mediate plant species coexistence via negative feedbacks. Extension of the PSF framework to the phyllosphere is needed to more fully elucidate plant-microbiota interactions.","2017",NA,"10.1111/ele.12805","WOS:000405917500014"

The role of rapid evolution for determining species coexistence is still poorly understood although evolutionary change on ecological time-scales has the potential to change almost any ecological process. The influence of evolution on coexistence can be especially pronounced inmicrobial communities where organisms often have large population sizes and short generation times. Previous work on coexistence has assumed that traits involved in resource use and species interactions are constant or change very slowly in terms of ecological time-scales. However, recent work suggests that these traits can evolve rapidly. Nevertheless, the importance of rapid evolution to coexistence has not been tested experimentally. Here, we show how rapid evolution alters the frequency of two bacterial competitors over time when grown together with specialist consumers (bacteriophages), a generalist consumer ( protozoan) and all in combination. We find that consumers facilitate coexistence in a manner consistent with classic ecological theory. However, through disentangling the relative contributions of ecology (changes in consumer abundance) and evolution (changes in traits mediating species interactions) on the frequency of the two competitors over time, we find differences between the consumer types and combinations. Overall, our results indicate that the influence of evolution on species coexistence strongly depends on the traits and species interactions considered.","2017",NA,"10.1098/rspb.2017.0415","WOS:000662166400001"

The shrimp Hippolyte obliquimanus inhabits shallow-water vegetated habitats, particularly the seasonal and physically complex brown alga Sargassum furcatum and the less-structured but temporally stable red weed Galaxaura marginata. Two main colour morphs can be found in these habitats: homogeneous colour-changing shrimp that are able to match to their background and show little mobility, and transparent shrimp with coloured stripes, which cannot match their background, show lower habitat fidelity and are more evenly distributed between algal habitats. We used carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes and Bayesian mixing models to test whether morphspecific patterns of habitat use observed for H. obliquimanus living in Sargassum and Galaxaura meadows also influence trophic niche segregation. We observed morph-specific trophic differences that varied with habitat, with narrower niche space and lower niche overlap between morphs in Galaxaura meadows, and broader niche space and higher niche overlap between morphs in Sargassum habitat. Niche segregation between morphs occurred only in Galaxaura, where available resources are presumably less abundant than in Sargassum and the strength of competition between morphs is higher. Resource availability and habitat stability are likely driving dietary niche segregation between shrimp morphs, which can ultimately affect population dynamics and community composition in a spatially heterogeneous and seasonal habitat.","2017",NA,"10.1007/s00227-017-3247-1","WOS:000413937500010"

The food-web length was on average one trophic position shorter in the subtropical shallow lakes compared with their temperate counterparts. This may reflect the fact that the large majority of subtropical fish species are omnivores (i.e., feed on more than one trophic level) and have a strong degree of feeding niche overlap. The shapes of the food webs of the subtropical lakes (truncated and trapezoidal) suggest that they are fuelled by a combination of different energy pathways. In contrast, temperate lake food webs tended to be more triangular, likely as a result of more simple pathways with a top predator integrating different carbon sources.

To characterize diverse belowground strategies in relation to species coexistence and abundance, we assessed four key belowground traits - root diameter, root branching intensity, first-order root length and mycorrhizal colonization - in 27 coexisting species from three grassland communities along a precipitation gradient. Species with thinner roots had higher root branching intensity, but shorter first-order root length and consistently low mycorrhizal colonization, whereas species with thicker roots enhanced their capacity for resource acquisition by producing longer first-order roots and maintaining high mycorrhizal colonization. Plant species observed across multiple sites consistently decreased root branching and/or mycorrhizal colonization, but increased lateral root length with decreasing precipitation. Additionally, the degree of intraspecific trait variation was positively correlated with species abundance across the gradient, indicating that high intraspecific trait variation belowground may facilitate greater fitness and chances of survival across multiple habitats. These results suggest that a small set of critical belowground traits can effectively define diverse resource acquisition strategies in different environments and may forecast species survival and range shifts under climate change.","2017",NA,"10.1111/nph.14710","WOS:000414639800020"

Here, we present a new moment-based approach to classify the shape of observed biomass-weighted trait distributions into normal, peaked, skewed, or bimodal that facilitates spatio-temporal and cross-system comparisons. Our observed phytoplankton trait distributions exhibited substantial variance and were mostly skewed or bimodal rather than normal. Additionally, mean, variance, skewness und kurtosis were strongly correlated. This is in conflict with trait-based aggregate models that often assume normally distributed trait values and small variances. Given these discrepancies between our data and general model assumptions we used the observed trait distributions to test how well different aggregate models with first- or second-order approximations and different types of moment closure predict the biomass, mean trait, and trait variance dynamics using weakly or moderately nonlinear fitness functions. For weakly non-linear fitness functions aggregate models with a second-order approximation and a data-based moment closure that relied on the observed correlations between skewness and mean, and kurtosis and variance predicted biomass and often also mean trait changes fairly well and better than models with first-order approximations or a normal-based moment closure. In contrast, none of the models reflected the changes of the trait variances reliably. Aggregate model performance was often also poor for moderately nonlinear fitness functions. This questions a general applicability of the normal-based approach, in particular for predicting variance dynamics determining the speed of trait changes and maintenance of biodiversity.

Here we characterize the colonization dynamics and abundance of nine species of Caenorhabditis nematodes in neotropical French Guiana, the most speciose known assemblage of this genus, with resource use overlap and notoriously similar external morphology despite deep genomic divergence. Methods: To characterize the dynamics and specificity of colonization and exploitation of ephemeral resource patches, we conducted manipulative field experiments and the largest sampling effort to date for Caenorhabditis outside of Europe. This effort provides the first in-depth quantitative analysis of substrate specificity for Caenorhabditis in natural, unperturbed habitats. Results: We amassed a total of 626 strain isolates from nine species of Caenorhabditis among 2865 substrate samples. With the two new species described here (C.astrocarya and C.dolens), we estimate that our sampling procedures will discover few additional species of these microbivorous animals in this tropical rainforest system. We demonstrate experimentally that the two most prevalent species (C.nouraguensis and C. tropicalis) rapidly colonize fresh resource patches, whereas at least one rarer species shows specialist micro-habitat fidelity. Conclusion: Despite the potential to colonize rapidly, these ephemeral patchy resources of rotting fruits and flowers are likely to often remain uncolonized by Caenorhabditis prior to their complete decay, implying dispersal-limited resource exploitation. We hypothesize that a combination of rapid colonization, high ephemerality of resource patches, and species heterogeneity in degree of specialization on micro-habitats and life histories enables a dynamic co-existence of so many morphologically cryptic species of Caenorhabditis.","2017",NA,"10.1186/s12898-017-0150-z","WOS:000418844900003"

We subjected a soil microcosm to physical disturbance, at a range of frequencies designed to simulate ecological disturbance events. We analyzed the fungal community structure using Illumina HiSeq sequencing of the ITS1 region. Fungal diversity was found to decline with the increasing disturbance frequencies, with no sign of the humpback pattern found in many studies of larger sedentary organisms. There is thus no evidence of an effect of release from competition resulting from moderate disturbance-which suggests that competition and niche overlap may not be important in limiting soil fungal diversity. Changing disturbance frequency also led to consistent differences in community composition. There were clear differences in OTU-level composition, with different disturbance treatments each having distinct fungal communities. The functional profile of fungal groups (guilds) was changed by the level of disturbance frequency. These predictable differences in community composition suggest that soil fungi can possess different niches in relation to disturbance frequency, or time since last disturbance.

However, no study to date has examined the effect of such phylogenetic density dependence on the transition from seed to seedling. Using 6 years of data on seedling recruitment and seed rain of 13 species from 130 stations (one 0.5 m(2) seed trap and three adjacent 1 m(2) seedling plots) in a subtropical evergreen forest, we asked: (1) Does negative density dependence act across seed to seedling stages? (2) Is there evidence for phylogenetic density dependence during the seed to seedling transition? (3) Does the strength of density dependence vary among years? Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to model seed to seedling transition as a function of conspecific seed and seedling densities, heterospecific seed and seedling densities, and mean phylogenetic distance of heterospecific seeds and seedling. Conspecific seed density had a significant negative effect on seedling transition rates for 12 of 13 focal species. In contrast, conspecific seedling density had a positive effect for 7 species, suggesting species-specific habitat preferences. Few species were significantly affected by the density or phylogenetic relatedness of heterospecific seeds and seedlings. Only conspecific seed density effects varied among years for most focal species. Overall, our results reveal that conspecific seed and seedling densities play a more important role than the density or relatedness of heterospecific seeds and seedlings during the seed to seedling stage, suggesting that species-specific seed predators, along with habitat preferences, may contribute to diversity maintenance in this forest.","2017",NA,"10.1007/s00442-017-3842-3","WOS:000400369200016"

Biweekly samples were collected for 24 consecutive months at the deepest point from 2005 to 2006. Water column properties shaping habitat suitability, namely temperature, light intensity, dissolved oxygen and phytoplankton biomass, varied markedly with depth but less with season. Most zooplankton stayed in the epilimnion continuously and their distribution was unaltered by lake stratification, mixing and restratification. Species dwelt permanently in the epilimnion without any necessity to migrate. Reduced water column variability and resultant weak selective pressures suppressed greater dispersion of species. Chaoborus ceratopogones (Theobald) was the main invertebrate predator and performed upward and downward movements on a diel cycle. Competing prey species overlapped extensively in spatial and temporal degree of habitat use. Chaoborus, however, segregated in deep water during the day, thereby minimizing prey vulnerability and promoting coexistence among predators and prey. During night-time residence, prey species may be exposed to increased predation risk from Chaoborus but gains in reproductive potential in warm, food-rich surface waters may offset losses to mortality. Our results suggest that high degree of habitat constancy and consequently weak selective pressures contributed to the lowered behavioural responses of zooplankton. The persistently skewed distribution of zooplankton is adaptive to predation and competition and promotes species coexistence. This behaviour will optimize growth and reproductive benefits over the cost of descent to suboptimal conditions in deep water.","2017",NA,"10.1051/limn/2017015","WOS:000412947200001"

However, the potential contribution of PSFs to community dynamics in changing forest ecosystems affected by global change drivers is still largely unexplored. We measured the direction, strength and nature (biological vs. chemical) of PSFs experienced by coexisting tree species in two types of declining Quercus suber forests of southwestern Spain (open woodland vs. closed forest) invaded by the exotic soil pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi. To test PSFs in a realistic community context, we focused not only on individual PSFs (i.e., comparing the growth of a tree species on conspecific vs. heterospecific soil) but also calculated net-pairwise PSFs by comparing performance of coexisting tree species on their own and each other's soils. We hypothesized that the decline and death of Q. suber would alter the direction and strength of individual and net-pairwise PSFs due to the associated changes in soil nutrients and microbial communities, with implications for recruitment dynamics and species coexistence. In support of our hypothesis, we found that the decline of Q. suber translated into substantial alterations of individual and net-pairwise PSFs, which shifted from mostly neutral to significantly positive or negative, depending on the forest type. In both cases however the identified PSFs benefited other species more than Q. suber (i.e., heterospecific positive PSF in the open woodland, conspecific negative PSF in the closed forest). Our results supported PSFs driven by changes in chemical soil properties (mainly phosphorus) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, but not in pathogen abundance. Overall, our study suggests that PSFs might reinforce the loss of dominance of Q. suber in declining forests invaded by P. cinnamomi by promoting the relative performance of non-declining coexisting species. More generally, our results indicate an increase in the strength of net PSFs as natural forests become disturbed by global change drivers (e.g., invasive species), suggesting an increasingly important role of PSFs in forest community dynamics in the near future.","2017",NA,"10.1002/ecy.1864","WOS:000404875100017"

Recent studies in the laboratory have confirmed theoretical predictions that bacteriocin production can determine coexistence, by eradicating sensitive competitors or driving the emergence of resistant genotypes. However, there is currently limited evidence that bacteriocin-mediated competition influences the coexistence and distribution of genotypes in natural environments, and what factors drive interactions towards inhibition remain unclear. Using natural soil populations of Pseudomonas fluorescens, we assessed the ability of the isolates to inhibit one another with respect to spatial proximity in the field, genetic similarity and niche overlap. The majority of isolates were found to produce bacteriocins; however, widespread resistance between coexisting isolates meant relatively few interactions resulted in inhibition. When inhibition did occur, it occurred more frequently between ecologically similar isolates. However, in contrast with results from other natural populations, we found no relationship between the frequency of inhibition and the genetic similarity of competitors. Our results suggest that bacteriocin production plays an important role in mediating competition over resources in natural settings and, by selecting for isolates resistant to local bacteriocin production, can influence the assembly of natural populations of P.fluorescens.","2017",NA,"10.1111/jeb.13010","WOS:000394850200012"

Recent theory predicts that both competition and predation (which causes apparent competition among prey) can either promote or limit species coexistence. Both mechanisms cause negative interactions between individuals, and each mechanism promotes stable coexistence if it causes negative interactions to be stronger between conspecifics than between heterospecifics. However, the relative importance of competition and predation for coexistence in natural communities is poorly known. Here, we study how competition and apparent competition via pre-dispersal seed predators affect the long-term fecundity of Protea shrubs in the fire-prone Fynbos biome (South Africa). These shrubs store all viable seeds produced since the last fire in fire-proof cones. Competitive effects on cone number and pre-dispersal seed predation reduce their fecundity and can thus limit recruitment after the next fire. In 27 communities comprising 49 990 shrubs of 22 Protea species, we measured cone number and per-cone seed predation rate of 2154 and 1755 focal individuals, respectively. Neighbourhood analyses related these measures to individual-based community maps. We found that conspecific neighbours had stronger competitive effects on cone number than heterospecific neighbours. In contrast, apparent competition via seed predators was comparable between conspecifics and heterospecifics. This indicates that competition stabilizes coexistence of Protea species, whereas pre-dispersal seed predation does not. Larger neighbours had stronger competitive effects and neighbours with large seed crops exerted stronger apparent competition. For 97% of the focal plants, competition reduced fecundity more than apparent competition. Our results show that even in communities of closely related and ecologically similar species, intraspecific competition can be stronger than interspecific competition. On the other hand, apparent competition through seed predators need not have such a stabilizing effect. These findings illustrate the potential of community demography', the demographic study of multiple interacting species, for understanding plant coexistence.","2017",NA,"10.1111/oik.03438","WOS:000394655600009"

This assessment is an important first step in quantifying food-web structure in a region subject to intense fishing activities. Nearshore food webs were driven by at least two isotopically distinct trophic pathways, algal and seagrass, with a greater proportion of the sampled species feeding within the seagrass food web (57%) compared with the algal food web (33%). There was considerable isotopic niche overlap among species (92% of species overlapped with at least one other species). Narrow isotopic niche widths of most (83%) species sampled, low isotopic similarity (only 23% of species exhibited no differences in C-13 and N-15) and low predicted trophic redundancy among fishes most commonly caught by fishermen (15%), however, suggest that adjustments to resource management concerning harvesting and gear selectivity may be needed for the persistence of artisanal fishing in northern Tanzania.

This inconsistency was especially true of intransitive combinations, resulting in increased species coexistence within the resource. Furthermore, the addition of a third competitor frequently destabilised the otherwise consistent outcomes of pairwise combinations in wood blocks, which occasionally resulted in altered resource decomposition rates, depending on the relative decay abilities of the species involved. Conversely, interaction outcomes in soil microcosms were unaffected by the presence of a third combatant.

Strategies to acquire soil N, such as direct uptake of organic compounds or associations with root symbionts to enhance N acquisition in exchange for carbon (C), may facilitate plant species coexistence and ecosystem N retention. Alternatively, rapid microbial turnover of soil N forms in tropical soils might promote flexible plant N-uptake strategies and mediate species coexistence. We tested whether sympatric plant species with different root symbiont associations, and therefore potentially different nutrient acquisition strategies, partition chemical forms of N or show plasticity in N uptake in a tropical pre-montane forest in Panama. We traced the movement of three N-15 forms into soil pools, microbes, and seedlings of eleven species differing in root traits. Seedlings were grown in a split-plot field transplant experiment, with plots receiving equimolar mixtures of ammonium, nitrate, and glycine, with one form isotopically labeled in each block. After 48 h, more N-15 was recovered in microbes than in plants, while all pools (extractable organic and inorganic N, microbial biomass, and leaves) contained greater amounts of N-15 from nitrate than from ammonium or glycine. Furthermore, C-13 from dual-labeled glycine was not recovered in the leaves of any seedling, suggesting the studied species do not directly take up organic N or transform organic N prior to translocation to leaves. Nitrogen uptake differed by root symbiont group only for nitrate, with greater N-15 recovery in plants with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) associations or proteoid roots compared to orchids. Some root trait groups differed in N-15 recovery among N forms, with greater nitrate uptake than ammonium or glycine by Lambda M-associated and N-2-fixing plants. However, only five of eleven species showed differences in uptake among N forms. These results indicate flexibility in uptake of N forms in tropical plants across root trait groups, with only a few species displaying weak preferences for a specific N form.","2017",NA,"10.1002/ecy.1793","WOS:000400598500017"

Fusarium tricinctum, the most common pathogenic Fusarium species, had the highest frequency from the control for A. capillaris and tended to increase with increasing grazing intensity for S. bungeana.

Stable isotope (SI) values (delta C-13 and delta N-15) were measured within the carapace of each species, and compared with SI values within potential food items. The integration of movement information and carapace SI data revealed that whilst these species had overlapping home ranges, there was less than 5% probability of inter-species dietary niche overlap. E. macrurus acquired food items consisting of bivalves, gastropods and aquatic insects within rocky riffles whilst E. albagula fed on filamentous algae and crustaceans foraged from the muddy and vegetated shallow margins of deep water pools. Our findings differ from stomach content analysis and mark-recapture studies, which reported these species to have similar habitat and resource requirements. We argue that the observed disparity is because our methods provided a weighted measure of an individual's dietary preference and habitat utilisation over a broad time-scale, whilst stomach content analysis and mark-recapture studies offer only a single observation of an individual's dietary preference.

The traditional morphometrics measuredtotal length, snout-to-vent length, eye diameter, premaxilla length, lower jaw length, gapewere regressed onto total length to test for allometry. Digital pictures were processed with tpsDig and further analyzed with MorphoJ utilizing a regular geometric morphometrics procedure using principle component analyses. We examined gut contents for 16 fish of each species. For the silverjaw minnows, we found all jaw variables to exhibit positive allometric growth with increasing total length, while most of the jaw variables for the sand shiner exhibited negative allometric growth with increasing total length. This correlates with an ontogenic prey shift for both species. Sand shiner minnows have been found to be more omnivorous, feeding on algae later in life, while silverjaw minnows undergo a prey shift to larger invertebrates. These species lack oral dentition causing an increased reliance on the pharyngeal apparatus. Principle component analyses revealed elongation of pharyngeal jaw elements in the silverjaw minnows and a relative shortening and bulking of pharyngeal jaws in the sand shiner minnows. The ontogenic dietary shifts observed in these two species provide possible explanation for the morphological changes over ontogeny in jaw elements, which are likely enabling these species to occupy the same habitat with little niche overlap.","2017",NA,"10.1002/jmor.20721","WOS:000409923000007"

We propose fatty acid composition in consumer tissue as a functional trait related to both food resources and physiological functions of species. We measured phylogenetic signal in fatty acid profiles of 13 field-sampled Collembola (springtail) species and then combined the data with published fatty acid profiles of another 24 species. Collembola fatty acid profiles generally showed phylogenetic signal, with related species resembling each other. Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, related to physiological functions, demonstrated phylogenetic signal. In contrast, most food resource biomarker fatty acids and the ratios between bacterial, fungal, and plant biomarker fatty acids exhibited no phylogenetic signal. Presumably, fatty acids related to physiological functions have been constrained during Collembola evolutionary history: Species with close phylogenetic affinity experienced similar environments during divergence, while niche partitioning in food resources among closely related species favored species coexistence. Measuring phylogenetic signal in ecologically relevant traits of coexisting species provides an evolutionary perspective to contemporary assembly processes of ecological communities.

One mechanism that can increase the likelihood of species co-existence, and thus species diversity, is a trade-off between competitive ability and the magnitude of plant growth response to AM fungal inoculation. By suppressing the growth of strong competitors while simultaneously enhancing the growth of weak competitors, this trade-off would cause the competitive hierarchy to be less pronounced in soil inoculated with AM fungi relative to non-inoculated conditions. To test whether such a trade-off exists, we quantified competitive abilities and mycorrhizal growth response (MGR) among 21 species that co-occur in old fields in southern Ontario. Competitive ability was determined by calculating competitive effect (CE), or the degree to which each species suppressed the biomass of a common phytometer species, Plantago lanceolata. Higher CE values represent stronger competitive ability. Old-field species varied in their ability to suppress the biomass of the phytometer and MGR was generally positive. There was a statistically significant negative correlation between CE in non-inoculated soil and MGR (r = -0.49, P = 0.02). In addition, variance in CE was 73% lower in soil inoculated with AM fungi compared to non-inoculated soil (P = 0.0023). These findings support the hypothesis that AM fungi weaken strong competitors while enhancing the performance of weak competitors. Because this trade-off compressed the competitive hierarchy among old-field species in soil inoculated with AM fungi, it may be a mechanism by which mycorrhizal fungi enhance species evenness and diversity.","2017",NA,"10.1007/s00442-016-3771-6","WOS:000394254500015"

Here we use a seven-year, common garden experiment to measure PSFs for seven native and six nonnative species common to the western United States. We use these long-term, field-based estimates to test correlations between PSF and plant landscape abundance, species origin, functional type, and lifespan. To assess potential PSF mechanisms, we also measured soil microbial community composition, root biomass, nitrogen cycling, bulk density, penetration resistance, and shear strength. Plant abundance on the landscape and plant lifespan were positively correlated with PSFs, though this effect was due to the relationships for native plants. PSFs were correlated with indices of soil microbial community composition. Soil nutrient and physical traits and root biomass differed among species but were not correlated with PSF. While results must be taken with caution because only 13 species were examined, these species represent most of the dominant plant species in the system. Results suggest that native plant abundance is associated with the ability of long-lived plants to create positive plant-soil microbe interactions, while short-lived nonnative plants maintain dominance by avoiding soil-borne antagonists, increasing nitrogen cycling and dedicating resources to aboveground growth and reproduction rather than to belowground growth. Broadly, results suggest that PSFs are correlated with a suite of traits that determine plant abundance.","2017",NA,"10.1002/ecy.2011","WOS:000416863500008"
"Maynard, DS; Crowther, TW; Bradford, MA","Competitive network determines the direction of the diversity-function relationship","PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA","The structure of the competitive network is an important driver of biodiversity and coexistence in natural communities. In addition to determining which species survive, the nature and intensity of competitive interactions within the network also affect the growth, productivity, and abundances of those individuals that persist. As such, the competitive network structure may likewise play an important role in determining community-level functioning by capturing the net costs of competition. Here, using an experimental system comprising 18 wood decay basidiomycete fungi, we test this possibility by quantifying the links among competitive network structure, species diversity, and community function. We show that species diversity alone has negligible impacts on community functioning, but that diversity interacts with two key properties of the competitive network-competitive intransitivity and average competitive ability-to ultimately shape biomass production, respiration, and carbon use efficiency. Most notably, highly intransitive communities comprising weak competitors exhibited a positive diversity-function relationship, whereas weakly intransitive communities comprising strong competitors exhibited a negative relationship. These findings demonstrate that competitive network structure can be an important determinant of community-level functioning, capturing a gradient from weakly to strongly competitive communities. Our research suggests that the competitive network may therefore act as a unifying link between diversity and function, providing key insight as to how and when losses in biodiversity will impact ecosystem function.","2017",NA,"10.1073/pnas.1712211114","WOS:000413520700067"
"Hiscox, J; Boddy, L","Armed and dangerous - Chemical warfare in wood decay communities","FUNGAL BIOLOGY REVIEWS","Fungal community structure and development in decaying woody resources are largely dependent on interspecific antagonistic interactions that determine the distribution of territory and hence the nutrients within between different individuals occupying that resource. Interactions are mediated by antagonistic mechanisms, which determine the combative outcome: either deadlock, where neither mycelium loses any territory, or replacement, where one mycelium displaces the other. These mechanisms function aggressively and/or defensively, and include changes in primary metabolism and growth, as well as secondary metabolite production and stress mitigation responses. This chemical warfare may occur as a constitutive defence through modification of the territory occupied by an individual, and the deposition of antimicrobial compounds within. Following detection of a competitor, the metabolite and enzymic profile of a mycelium alters both qualitatively and quantitatively, and different mechanisms may be stimulated when confronted with different competitors. Biotic and abiotic factors, even small alterations, can affect the deployment of these antagonistic mechanisms, altering the general hierarchy of combative ability between species and making it impossible to predict outcomes with certainty. Here we explore recent advances in our understanding of combative interactions between wood decayers, and explain why future research priorities involving the application of emerging biochemical and molecular technologies must focus on interactions in more ecologically realistic and meaningful scenarios.

During succession, AM herbaceous vegetation is replaced by predominantly EcM woody species.

We collected root and soil samples from three different microenvironments: stand of C. epigejos, under S. caprea canopy, and contact zone where roots of the two species interacted. RAF communities and mycorrhizal colonization were determined in sampled roots, and the soil was tested for EcM and AM inoculation potentials. Although the microenvironment significantly affected composition of the RAF communities in both plant species, the effect was greater in the case of C. epigejos RAF communities than in that of S. caprea RAF communities. The presence of S. caprea also significantly decreased AM fungal abundance in soil as well as AM colonization and richness of AM fungi in C. epigejos roots. Changes observed in the abundance and community composition of AM fungi might constitute an important factor in transition from AM-dominated to EcM-dominated vegetation during succession.","2017",NA,"10.1007/s00572-017-0792-x","WOS:000413303000004"

Herewe report on the characteristic fungal communities generated by these ant species in their domatia. First, we describe behavioural differences between the ant species when presented with a cultured fungal isolate in the laboratory. Second, we use DNA metabarcoding to show that each ant species has a distinctive fungal community in its domatia, and that these communities remain characteristic of the ant species over two Kenyan sampling locations separated by 190 km. Third, we find that DNA extracted from female alates of Tetraponera penzigi and Crematogaster nigriceps contained matches for most of the fungal meta-barcodes from those ant species' domatia, respectively. Fungal hyphae and other debris are also visible in sections of these alates' infrabuccal pockets. Collectively, our results indicate that domatium fungal communities are associated with the ant species occupying the tree. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first record of such ant-specific fungal community-level differences on the same myrmecophytic host species. These differences may be shaped by ant behaviour in the domatia, and by ants vectoring fungi when they disperse to establish new colonies.

"Raatz, M; Gaedke, U; Wacker, A","High food quality of prey lowers its risk of extinction","OIKOS","The mineral and biochemical food quality of prey may limit predator production. This well-studied direct bottom-up effect is especially prominent for herbivore-plant interactions. Low-quality prey species, particularly when defended, are generally considered to be less prone to predator-driven extinction. Undefended high-quality prey species sustain high predator production thereby potentially increasing their own extinction risk. The food quality of primary producers is highly species-specific. In communities of competing prey species, predators thus may supplement their diets of low-quality prey with high-quality prey, leading to indirect horizontal interactions between prey species of different food quality. We explore how these predator-mediated indirect interactions affect species coexistence in a general predator-prey model that is parametrized for an experimental algae-rotifer system. To cover a broad range of three essential functional traits that shape many plant-herbivore interactions we consider differences in 1) the food quality of the prey species, 2) their competitive ability for nutrient uptake and 3) their defence against predation. As expected, low food quality of prey can, similarly to defence, provide protection against extinction by predation. Counterintuitively, our simulations demonstrate that being of high food quality also prevents extinction of that prey species and additionally promotes coexistence with a competing, low-quality prey. The persistence of the high-quality prey enables a high conversion efficiency and control of the low-quality prey by the predator and allows for re-allocation of nutrients to the high-quality competitor. Our results show that high food quality is not necessarily detrimental for a prey species but instead can protect against extinction and promote species richness and functional biodiversity.","2017",NA,"10.1111/oik.03863","WOS:000412070800014"

We investigate this issue via a tripartite mutualism involving an ant plant, two competing ant species and a fungus the ants cultivate to build galleries under the stems of their host plant to capture insect prey. The use of the galleries represents an innovative prey capture strategy compared with the more typical strategy of foraging on leaves. However, because of a limited worker force in their colonies, the prey capture behaviour of the ants results in a trade-off between plant protection (i.e. the ants patrol the foliage and attack intruders including herbivores) and ambushing prey in the galleries, which has a cascading effect on the fitness of all of the partners. The quantification of partners' traits and effects showed that the two ant species differed in their mutualistic investment. Less investment in the galleries (i.e. in fungal cultivation) translated into more benefits for the plant in terms of less herbivory and higher growth rates and vice versa. However, the greater vegetative growth of the plants did not produce a positive fitness effect for the better mutualistic ant species in terms of colony size and production of sexuals nor was the mutualist compensated by the wider dispersal of its queens. As a consequence, although the better ant mutualist is the one that provides more benefits to its host plant, its lower host-plant exploitation does not give this ant species a competitive advantage. The local coexistence of the ant species is thus fleeting and should eventually lead to the exclusion of the less competitive species.","2017",NA,"10.1098/rspb.2016.1679","WOS:000397883100002"

Plant species persistence in natural communities requires coping with biotic and abiotic challenges. These challenges also depend on plant community composition and diversity. Over time, biodiversity effects have been shown to be strengthened via increasing species complementarity in mixtures. Little is known, however, whether differences in community diversity and composition induce rapid transgenerational phenotypic adaptive differentiation during community assembly. We expect altered plant-plant and other biotic interactions (mutualists or antagonists) in high vs. low diverse communities to affect immediate within-and between-species trait differentiations due to competition for light and nutrients. 2. Three years after the initiation of a large-scale, long-term biodiversity experiment in Jena, Germany, we tested for effects of varying experimental plant community diversity (1-60 plant species; one to four plant functional groups) and composition (with or without legumes and/or grasses) on phenotypic differentiation and variation of the tall herb Knautia arvensis. We measured reproduction at different diversity levels in the Jena Experiment (residents hereafter) and, in an additional common garden experiment without competition, recorded subsequent offspring performance (i.e. growth, reproductive success and susceptibility to powdery mildew) to test for differentiation in phenotypic expression and variability. 3. We observed phenotypic differences among diversity levels with reduced fecundity of K. arvensis residents in more diverse communities. In the next generation grown under common garden conditions, offspring from high-diversity plots showed reduced growth (i.e. height) and lower reproduction (i.e. fewer infructescences), but increased phenotypic trait variability (e.g. in leaf width and powdery mildew presence) and also tended to be less susceptible to powdery mildew infection. 4. Community composition also affected Knautia parents and offspring. In the presence of legumes, resident plants produced more seeds (increased fecundity); however, germination rate of those seeds was reduced at an early seedling stage (reduced fertility). 5. Synthesis. We conclude that rapid transgenerational effects of community diversity and composition on both mean and variation of phenotypic traits among offspring exist. In addition to heritable variation, environmentally induced epigenetic and/or maternal processes matter for early plant community assembly and may also determine future species coexistence and community stability.","2017",NA,"10.1111/1365-2745.12689","WOS:000400594500015"

Here, we report on the first rigorous experimental test of this hypothesis, using the rapidly evolving bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 and six different bacterial competitors. We show that the earlier arrival of P. fluorescens facilitated its diversification.

The model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae is commonly used to study mitochondrial biology. It has two mating types: MATa and MATa. Previous studies have suggested that the mtDNA inheritance patterns in hybrid diploid cells depend on the genetic background of parental strains. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To elucidate the mechanisms, we examined the effects of environmental factors on the mtDNA inheritance patterns in hybrids obtained by crossing S. cerevisiae with its close relative S. paradoxus. The results demonstrated that environmental factors can influence mtDNA transmission in hybrid diploids, and that the inheritance patterns are strain dependent. The fitness competition assay results showed that the fitness differences can explain the mtDNA inheritance patterns under specific conditions. However, in this study, we found that fitness differences cannot fully be explained by mitochondrial activity in hybrids under stress conditions.","2017",NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0169953","WOS:000391949500107"

However, these forces, which include environmental selection, dispersal, and organism interactions, are often difficult to assess in natural environments. Here, we present a method that links microbial community structures with selective and stochastic forces through highly replicated subsampling and enrichment of a single environmental inoculum. Specifically, groundwater from a well-studied natural aquifer was serially diluted and inoculated into nearly 1,000 aerobic and anaerobic nitrate-reducing cultures, and the final community structures were evaluated with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We analyzed the frequency and abundance of individual operational taxonomic units (OTUs) to understand how probabilistic immigration, relative fitness differences, environmental factors, and organismal interactions contributed to divergent distributions of community structures. We further used a most probable number (MPN) method to estimate the natural condition-dependent cultivable abundance of each of the nearly 400 OTU cultivated in our study and infer the relative fitness of each. Additionally, we infer condition-specific organism interactions and discuss how this high-replicate culturing approach is essential in dissecting the interplay between overlapping ecological forces and taxon-specific attributes that underpin microbial community assembly. IMPORTANCE Through highly replicated culturing, in which inocula are subsampled from a single environmental sample, we empirically determine how selective forces, interspecific interactions, relative fitness, and probabilistic dispersal shape bacterial communities. These methods offer a novel approach to untangle not only interspecific interactions but also taxon-specific fitness differences that manifest across different cultivation conditions and lead to the selection and enrichment of specific organisms. Additionally, we provide a method for estimating the number of cultivable units of each OTU in the original sample through the MPN approach.","2017",NA,"10.1128/AEM.01253-17","WOS:000412029400009"

While several studies have provided empirical evidence supporting the significance of the temporal storage effect for coexistence, empirical tests of the role of the spatial storage effect are rare. In particular, we know little about how the spatial storage effect contributes to biodiversity over evolutionary timescales. Here, we report the first experimental study on the role of the spatial storage effect in the maintenance of biodiversity in evolving metacommunities, using the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 as a laboratory model of adaptive radiation. We found that intercommunity spatial heterogeneity promoted phenotypic diversity of P. fluorescens in the presence of dispersal among local communities, by allowing the spatial storage effect to operate. Mechanistically, greater niche differences among P. fluorescens phenotypes arose in metacommunities with intercommunity spatial heterogeneity, facilitating negative frequency-dependent selection, and thus, the coexistence among P. fluorescens phenotypes.

Competitive exclusion should be particularly strong when species compete for a single limiting resource or live in unstructured habitats that offer no refuge for weaker competitors. Here, we describe the 'cheating effect', a form of intra-specific competition that can counterbalance between-species competition, thereby fostering biodiversity in unstructured habitats. Using experimental communities consisting of the strong competitor Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and its weaker counterpart Burkholderia cenocepacia (BC), we show that co-existence is impossible when the two species compete for a single limiting resource, iron. However, when introducing a PA cheating mutant, which specifically exploits the iron-scavenging siderophores produced by the PA wild type, we found that biodiversity was preserved under well-mixed conditions where PA cheats could outcompete the PA wild type. Cheating fosters biodiversity in our system because it creates strong intra-specific competition, which equalizes fitness differences between PA and BC. Our study identifies cheating - typically considered a destructive element - as a constructive force in shaping biodiversity.","2017",NA,"10.1038/ismej.2016.195","WOS:000399379500011"

We designed a competitive fitness assay to detect adaptation of Saccharomyces paradoxus isolates to the habitat they were isolated from (oak or larch leaf litter). The assay accurately measures relative fitness by tracking genotype frequency changes in the field using digital droplet PCR (DDPCR). We expected locally adapted S.paradoxus strains to increase in frequency over time when growing on the leaf litter type from which they were isolated. The DDPCR assay successfully detected fitness differences among S.paradoxus strains, but did not find a tendency for strains to be adapted to the habitat they were isolated from. Instead, we found that the natural alleles of the hexose transport gene we used to distinguish S.paradoxus strains had significant effects on fitness. The origin of a strain also affected its fitness: strains isolated from oak litter were generally fitter than strains from larch litter. Our results suggest that dispersal limitation and genetic drift shape S.paradoxus populations in the forest more than local selection does, although further research is needed to confirm this.

However, how this stochasticity affects interactions between competing microbes in mixed communities is difficult to assess. One example of such an interaction system is the competition of an Escherichia coli strain C, which performs division of labor between reproducers and self-sacrificing toxin producers, with a toxin-sensitive strain S. The decision between reproduction or toxin production within a single C cell is inherently stochastic. Here, combining experimental and theoretical approaches, we demonstrate that this stochasticity in the initial phase of colony formation is the crucial determinant for the competition outcome. In the initial phase (t < 12h), stochasticity influences the formation of viable C clusters at the colony edge. In the subsequent phase, the effective fitness differences (set primarily by the degree of division of labor in the C strain population) dictate the deterministic population dynamics and consequently competition outcome. In particular, we observe that competitive success of the C strain is only found if (i) a C edge cluster has formed at the end of the initial competition phase and (ii) the beneficial and detrimental effects of toxin production are balanced, which is the case at intermediate toxin producer fractions. Our findings highlight the importance of stochastic processes during the initial phase of colony formation, which might be highly relevant for other microbial community interactions in which the random choice between phenotypes can have long-lasting consequences for community fate.","2017",NA,"10.1371/journal.pbio.2001457","WOS:000402520000010"
"Lyons, DM; Lauring, AS","Evidence for the Selective Basis of Transition-to-Transversion Substitution Bias in Two RNA Viruses","MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","The substitution rates of transitions are higher than expected by chance relative to those of transversions. Many have argued that selection disfavors transversions, as nonsynonymous transversions are less likely to conserve biochemical properties of the original amino acid. Only recently has it become feasible to directly test this selective hypothesis by comparing the fitness effects of a large number of transition and transversion mutations. For example, a recent study of six viruses and one beta-lactamase gene did not find evidence supporting the selective hypothesis. Here, we analyze the relative fitness effects of transition and transversion mutations from our recently published genome-wide study of mutational fitness effects in influenza virus. In contrast to prior work, we find that transversions are significantly more detrimental than transitions. Using what we believe to be an improved statistical framework, we also identify a similar trend in two HIV data sets. We further demonstrate a fitness difference in transition and transversion mutations using four deep mutational scanning data sets of influenza virus and HIV, which provided adequate statistical power. We find that three of the most commonly cited radical/conservative amino acid categories are predictive of fitness, supporting their utility in studies of positive selection and codon usage bias. We conclude that selection is a major contributor to the transition:transversion substitution bias in viruses and that this effect is only partially explained by the greater likelihood of transversion mutations to cause radical as opposed to conservative amino acid changes.","2017",NA,"10.1093/molbev/msx251","WOS:000416178900015"

Since 2000, a new epidemic wave of rabies has emerged in Yunnan Province, southwestern China, which borders three countries in Southeast Asia. Method: We estimated gene-specific evolutionary rates for rabies virus using available data in GenBank, then used this information to calibrate the timescale of rabies virus (RABV) spread in Asia. We used 452 publicly available geo-referenced complete nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences, including 52 RABV sequences that were recently generated from samples collected in Yunnan between 2008 and 2012. Results: The RABV N gene evolutionary rate was estimated to be 1.88 x 10(-4) (1.37-2.41 x 10(-4), 95% Bayesian credible interval, BCI) substitutions per site per year. Phylogenetic reconstructions show that the currently circulating RABV lineages in Yunnan result from at least seven independent introductions (95% BCI: 6-9 introductions) and represent each of the three main Asian RABV lineages, SEA-1, -2 and -3. We find that Yunnan is a sink location for the domestic spread of RABV and connects RABV epidemics in North China, South China, and Southeast Asia. Cross-border spread from southeast Asia (SEA) into South China, and intermixing of the North and South China epidemics is also well supported. The influx of RABV into Yunnan from SEA was not well-supported, likely due to the poor sampling of SEA RABV diversity. We found evidence for a lineage displacement of the Yunnan SEA-2 and -3 lineages by Yunnan SEA-1 strains, and considered whether this could be attributed to fitness differences.

However, a robust understanding of the structural composition of the bacterial microbiome present in different plant microenvironments and especially the relationship between below-ground and above-ground communities has remained elusive. In this work, we addressed hypotheses regarding microbiome niche differentiation and structural stability of the bacterial communities within different ecological plant niches. Methods: We sampled the rhizosphere soil, root, stem, and leaf endosphere of field-grown poplar trees (Populus tremula x Populus alba) and applied 16S rRNA amplicon pyrosequencing to unravel the bacterial communities associated with the different plant habitats. Results: We found that the structural variability of rhizosphere microbiomes in field-grown poplar trees (P. tremula x P. alba) is much lower than that of the endosphere microbiomes. Furthermore, our data not only confirm microbiome niche differentiation reports at the rhizosphere soil-root interface but also clearly show additional fine-tuning and adaptation of the endosphere microbiome in the stem and leaf compartment.

Here, we introduce genomes, structural proteomes, and quantitative host range data for eight Pseudoalteromonas phages isolated from Helgoland (North Sea, Germany) and use these data to advance a genome-based viral operational taxonomic unit (OTU) definition. These viruses represent five new genera and inform 498 unaffiliated or unannotated protein clusters (PCs) from global virus metagenomes. In a comparison of previously sequenced Pseudoalteromonas phage isolates (n = 7) and predicted prophages (n = 31), the eight phages are unique. They share a genus with only one other isolate, Pseudoalteromonas podophage RIO-1 (East Sea, South Korea) and two Pseudoalteromonas prophages. Mass-spectrometry of purified viral particles identified 12-20 structural proteins per phage. When combined with 3-D structural predictions, these data led to the functional characterization of five previously unidentified major capsid proteins. Protein functional predictions revealed mechanisms for hijacking host metabolism and resources. Further, they uncovered a hybrid sipho-myovirus that encodes genes for Mu-like infection rarely described in ocean systems. Finally, we used these data to evaluate a recently introduced definition for virus populations that requires members of the same population to have >95% average nucleotide identity across at least 80% of their genes. Using physiological traits and genomics, we proposed a conceptual model for a viral OTU definition that captures evolutionarily cohesive and ecologically distinct units. In this trait-based framework, sensitive hosts are considered viral niches, while host ranges and infection efficiencies are tracked as viral traits. Quantitative host range assays revealed conserved traits within virus OTUs that break down between OTUs, suggesting the defined units capture niche and fitness differentiation. Together these analyses provide a foundation for model system-based hypothesis testing that will improve our understanding of marine copiotrophs, as well as phage-host interactions on the ocean particles and aggregates where Pseudoalteromonas thrive.","2017",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2017.01241","WOS:000405228800001"

However, a mechanistic understanding for the outcome of pathogen competition often remains unresolved, as in the case of the displacement of the West Nile virus (WNV) NY99 genotype by the newer WN02 genotype. In this study, we seek to explain the observed displacement of the NY99 genotype by examining evidence for differences between NY99 and WN02 over WNV's entire transmission cycle. We synthesized the available empirical data on key aspects of WNV's transmission cycle including viral titer profiles in birds, survival of birds, bird-to-mosquito transmission probability, and mosquito- to-bird transmission probability for infections with both the NY99 and WN02 genotypes of WNV. Using a Bayesian statistical framework, we combine our literature synthesis on infection dynamics in birds and mosquitos with bird community and mosquito life history parameters to examine fitness differences between NY99 and WN02. We calculate the intrinsic reproduction numbers (R-0) for NY99 and WN02 and assume a larger value of R-0 for WN02 will explain its competitive dominance over NY99. Our analysis of the collective body of experimental infections of birds and mosquitos produced similar R-0 estimates for NY99 and WN02 with wide overlapping credible intervals, which we take as insufficient evidence for greater fitness of WN02. The currently cited explanation for the displacement of WN02 by NY99-the attribution of the displacement of NY99 by WN02 to the latter's more efficient replication in mosquitos-is, at best, weakly supported by the evidence. Further infection studies of American Robins (Turdus migratorius) and broader coverage of possibly competent hosts for WN02, as well as more ecological data such as the spatial and temporal differences in vector and bird communities, will be needed to fully understand the community dynamics of WNVand the determinants of higher fitness in the WN02 genotype.","2017",NA,"10.1002/ecs2.1684","WOS:000397102400023"

Phylogenetic and genomic evidence indicates that N2O reducing communities can be divided into two genetically distinct groups, termed Glade I and II. Differing abundance or diversity of each Glade may have significant consequences for N2O emissions from soil. However, whether the two groups respond similarly to gradients of environmental or biotic factors in soils remains unclear. Here, we explore spatial patterns of nosZ Glade I and II abundance, phylogenetic diversity and community structure across a 44-ha farm, and compare with edaphic factors and abundances of ammonia oxidizing and denitrifying communities, which are the main N2O producers in soil. Contrasting spatial distributions of the total abundance and phylogenetic diversity of each Glade, as well as disparate associations with various edaphic and biotic factors indicated potential niche differentiation between the two clades. This is supported by the greater occurrence of significant phylogenetic clustering or overdispersion in Glade I communities compared to Glade II, indicating differences in the underlying mechanisms of community assembly for each group. Variance partitioning of phylogenetic community structure further showed that biotic factors, particularly the abundance of denitrifiers, played a more substantial role in explaining Glade II community structure compared to that of Glade I. Finally, identification of nosZ lineages driving differences in community structure and spatial distribution patterns of gene abundances suggests a shift in the genetic potential for N2O production and consumption dynamics across the farm.

The effect was commonly thought to be an artifact of dimensionality reduction, and multiple techniques were developed to unravel this phenomenon and simplify interpretation. Here, we provide evidence that horseshoes arise as a consequence of distance metrics that saturate-a familiar concept in other fields but new to microbial ecology. This saturation property loses information about community dissimilarity, simply because it cannot discriminate between samples that do not share any common features. The phenomenon illuminates niche differentiation in microbial communities and indicates species turnover along environmental gradients. Here we propose a rationale for the observed horseshoe effect from multiple dimensionality reduction techniques applied to simulations, soil samples, and samples from postmortem mice. An in-depth understanding of this phenomenon allows targeting of niche differentiation patterns from high-level ordination plots, which can guide conventional statistical tools to pinpoint microbial niches along environmental gradients.

Establishing small juvenile individuals and established, larger, sexually reproducing adult individuals represent two life-history stages within species. We investigated the nitrogen and carbon resource use of adult and juvenile individuals and similarity of symbiotic fungal community composition in these two plant life stages. We used the plant Solidago virgaurea growing in a simplified system in the low Arctic as model species. Methods Isotopic signatures (foliar delta N-15 and foliar delta C-13) were analysed to characterize nitrogen acquisition and water-use efficiency of the plants. Symbiotic root fungal community composition was estimated by cloning and sequencing small subunit ribosomal RNA gene. Important Findings The isotopic signatures differed significantly between the life stages, indicating that the establishing juvenile cohort used relatively more amino acids or gained N through mycorrhizal symbiosis in comparison to the established adult plants. Symbiotic fungal communities did not differ between the two plant cohorts suggesting a possibility that the plants shared the same mycorrhizal network. We conclude that competition-mediated differences in plant resource use may create niche differentiation between the two life-history stages and enable them to coexist.","2017",NA,"10.1093/jpe/rtw123","WOS:000417978400003"

These habitats are characterized by conditions ideal for foliar bacteria, which can be potent plant pathogens. Leaf production, retention and susceptibility to enemies may ultimately depend upon interactions among soil nutrients and foliar microbes, yet this has never been tested. We experimentally evaluated the degree that foliar bacteria and soil resource supply mediate leaf dynamics for five common tree species (five different families) in a Panamanian forest. We reduced foliar bacteria with antibiotics for 29 months and measured leaf production, retention and damage for seedlings nested within a replicated 15-yr factorial nutrient enrichment experiment (nitrogen, N; phosphorus, P; potassium, K). Our results demonstrate that when we applied antibiotics, soil nutrients - particularly N - always regulated seedling leaf production (and to a lesser extent herbivore damage) for all five tree species. In addition, it was common for two macronutrients together to negate or completely reverse the impact of applying either one alone. Our findings of frequent plant-microbe-nutrient interactions are novel and suggest that these interactions may reinforce plant species-environment associations, thereby creating a fairly cryptic and fine-scale dimension of niche differentiation for coexisting tree species.","2017",NA,"10.1111/nph.14716","WOS:000408591500013"

In this study, the microbial competitions for a common substrate (nitrite) among three anammox species (Le. Candidatus Brocadia sinica, Candidatus Jettenia caeni and Candidatus Kuenenia stuttgartiensis) were systematically investigated in nitrite-limited gel-immobilized column reactors (GICR) and membrane bioreactors (MBRs) under different nitrogen loading rates (NLRs). 16 S rRNA gene-based population dynamics revealed that Ca. J. caeni could proliferate only at low NLRs, whereas Ca. B. sinica out competed other two species at higher NLRs in both types of reactors. Furthermore, FISH analysis revealed that Ca. J. caeni was mainly present as spherical microclusters at the inner part (low NO2- environment), whereas Ca. B. sinica was present throughout the gel beads and granules. This spatial distribution supports the outcomes of the competition experiments. However, the successful competition of Ca. J. caeni at low NLR could not be explained with the Monod model probably due to inaccuracy of kinetic parameters such as half saturation constant (K-s) for nitrite and a difference in the maintenance rate (m). In addition, the growth of Ca. K. stuttgartiensis could not be observed in any experimental conditions, suggesting possible unknown factor(s) is missing.

In this study niche differentiation of the key SOB was addressed by extensive sampling of active sulfidic vents at six different hydrothermal venting sites in the Manus Basin, off Papua New Guinea.

When species compete directly for space, competitive ability differences should theoretically promote trait and phylogenetic clustering, provided that niche differences are otherwise minimal. Yet many sessile communities exhibit high biodiversity despite minimal reliance on niche differentiation. A potential explanation is that intransitive competition ('rock-paper-scissors' competition) not only promotes species richness but also fosters coexistence among highly dissimilar species with different competitive strategies. Here, we test this hypothesis using a combination of empirical and analytical approaches. In an experimental system comprising 37 wood-decay basidiomycete fungi grown in nutrient-rich agar media, pairwise displacement was maximized when species had widely different competitive traits and divergent evolutionary histories. However, when these interactions were embedded in models of species-rich communities, high levels of intransitivity ultimately overwhelmed the pairwise relationships, allowing the weakest and most dissimilar species to survive. In line with theoretical expectations, these multispecies assemblages exhibited reduced functional and phylogenetic diversity, yet the smallest losses were likewise observed in species-rich communities. By demonstrating that species richness can act as a self-reinforcing buffer against competitive exclusion, these results contribute to our understanding of how biodiversity is maintained in natural systems.","2017",NA,"10.1038/s41559-017-0156","WOS:000417174700014"

Specifically, competitive carbon flows in the presence of multiple micropredators, as well as trophic links within and between microbial kingdoms have rarely been resolved. Here, using maize-planted agricultural soil as a model system, we have investigated the predation of amended bacterial prey by both prokaryotic and eukaryotic micropredators. We have queried how soil compartment (rhizosphere vs bulk soil) and nature of prey (Gram-positive vs Gram-negative) influence predation outcomes. We added C-13-labelled biomass of Pseudomonas putida and Arthrobacter globiformis to soil microcosms and found that P. putida was consumed much more rapidly. Bacteria and microeukaryotes specifically responsive to the biomass amendments were identified by RNA-stable isotope probing. Amongst the bacteria, only a few myxobacteria sequestered C from A. globiformis, whereas a considerable diversity of predatory bacteria incorporated C derived from P. putida. Diverse groups of heterotrophic protists, especially amoeba including Glaeseria, Hartmanella and Vahlkampfia spp., were observed to incorporate C-13 from both amendments, but with pronounced niche differentiation between rhizosphere and bulk soil. This provides novel insights into niche partitioning between bacterial and eukaryotic micropredators in soil, driven not only by the nature of bacterial prey itself, but also by soil compartments.","2017",NA,"10.1093/femsec/fix103","WOS:000416387400006"

Methods. Here we evaluated effects of differences in OM related to agricultural land use (OM derived from ditches adjacent to grasslands, bulb fields and a pristine dune area) on microbial functioning.

A disparity existed between microbial resource niche breadth in laboratory incubations and natural microbial communities. Resource utilization and niche breadth of natural microbial communities was observed to be constrained in drainage ditches adjacent to agricultural fields. This outcome coincides with retarded degradation of natural OM collected from ditches adjacent to hyacinth bulb fields. Microbial communities in bulb field ditches further showed functional redundancy when offered grassland OM of seemingly higher substrate quality. Discussion. Results presented in this study suggest that agricultural practices can impose constraints on microbial functional diversity by reducing OM resource quality, which can subsequently translate to confined microbial resource niche differentiation and reduced organic matter degradation rates. This hints that assessments of actual microbial resource utilization and niche differentiation could potentially be used to assess the ecological health and functioning of natural communities.","2017",NA,"10.7717/peerj.4175","WOS:000419184400004"

Phenotypic variation controls the species interactions which determine whether or not species coexist. Long-standing hypotheses in ecology and evolution posit that phenotypic differentiation enables coexistence by increasing the size of niche differentiation. This hypothesis has only been tested using macroscopic traits to date, but niche differentiation, particularly of microscopic organisms, also occurs at the molecular and metabolic level. 2. We examined how phenotypic variation that arises at the level of gene expression over evolutionary time affects phytoplankton species interactions and coexistence. 3. We predicted that similarity in gene expression among species would decline with phylogenetic distance, and that reduced similarity in gene expression would weaken competition, increase facilitation and promote coexistence. 4. To test this, we grew eight species of freshwater green algae in monocultures and bicultures for 46 days in a laboratory microcosm experiment. We quantified the strength of species interactions by: (i) fitting Lotka-Volterra models to time-series densities and estimating interaction coefficients, and (ii) calculating relative densities that compare species' steady-state densities in biculture to those in monoculture. We used Illumina high throughput sequencing to quantify the expression of 1253 families of homologous genes, including a set of 17 candidate genes that we hypothesized a priori to be involved in competition or facilitation. 5. Synthesis. We found that closely related species had greater similarity in gene expression than did distantly related species, but as gene expression became more similar, species experienced weaker competition or greater facilitation, and were more likely to coexist. We identified gene functional categories that were uniquely differentially regulated in association with particular species interaction types. Contrary to common thinking in ecology and evolution, similarity in gene expression, and not differentiation, was associated with weaker competition, facilitation and coexistence.","2017",NA,"10.1111/1365-2745.12759","WOS:000400594500003"

Shoot delta N-15 and N concentration were measured to determine the N uptake and use abilities of 4 common species. All plant species preferred to take up nitrate (the dominant N form) over ammonium and glycine, and N-acquisition capacity varied with temporal variation of soil N. However, the dominant species was more N-conservative than less-dominant species and had lower overall N uptake rates (shoot N-15 excess 48 hours after injection) and higher N use efficiencies (aboveground biomass : N ratio). The different N strategies may reflect mixed effects of environmental filtering and interspecific competition and have significant implications for species coexistence as well as for ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling.","2017",NA,"10.1007/s11104-017-3296-8","WOS:000411232600021"

In this study we examined the contribution of AOA to nitrification within alkaline (pH 8.3-8.7) cave environments using quantitative PCR, crenarchaeol lipid identification and measurement of potential nitrification rates. Our results showed that AOA outnumber ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) by up to four orders of magnitude in cave sediments.

Phylogenetic analysis of Thaumarchaeota amoA gene sequences demonstrated similarity to amoA clones across a range of terrestrial habitats, including acidic ecosystems. These data suggest that despite the alkaline conditions within the cave, the low NH3 concentrations measured continue to favor growth of AOA over AOB populations.

However, a further question, whether or not the :mechanism of community assembly and diversity maintenance of the gut microbiome is influenced by CRC has not been addressed. To address this question, we applied Hubbell's neutral theory for biodiversity to reanalyze the dataset from Wang et al.'s (2012) study of the gut microbiome sampled from 46 CRC patients and 56 healthy individuals. Our reanalysis presents two important findings. Firstly, our analysis demonstrated that only around 4% (4/102) samples (in total of both the CRC and control groups) have their species abundance distribution (SAD) satisfied the prediction of the neutral theory null model. No significant difference in the number of the samples satisfying the neutral null model was detected between the healthy individuals and CRC patients, suggesting that the nature or mechanism of community assembly and diversity maintenance of the gut microbiome is not significantly influenced by CRC. That is, the stochasticity of survival, reproduction and migration of gut microbes, as implied by the neutral theory model, does not play a significant role in shaping the community assembly and diversity maintenance. We further infer that the alternative hypothesis to the neutral null model, i.e., the deterministic niche differentiations should be the driving forces that shape the assembly and diversity maintenance of the gut microbiome in both the healthy individuals and CRC patients, Secondly, although CRC does not seem to influence the nature of community assembly, we postulate that it may indirectly influence the outcome (i,e., the community composition as measured by community diversity) of the community assembly, possibly by influencing niche differentiations, This postulation is supported by our second finding: the diversity of the gut microbiome in CRC patients is significantly lower than that in the healthy individuals as demonstrated by the fundamental diversity parameter (0) of the neutral theory model.

Using a high-throughput Illumina Miseq sequencing platform, we characterized the bacterial communities in a semi-arid steppe subjected to long-term N or P additions. Our results showed that both the Chao richness and Shannon's diversity were negatively correlated to N input rate, while only Chao richness was significantly and negatively correlated to P input rate. Also, both N and P additions altered the bacterial community structure. The bacterial community between plots of the same N or P input rate was much more dissimilar with the higher input level, indicating more severe niche differentiation in pots with higher N or P input. N Inputs significantly increased the relative abundance of the predicted copiotrophic groups (Proteobacteria and Firmicutes) but reduced the predicted oligotrophic groups (Acidobacteria, Nitrospirae, Chloraflexi), with the order Rhizobiales being most affected. P additions significantly affected only two phyla (Armatimonadetes and Chlorobi), which were positively correlated with P source. Results from the structural equation modelling (SEM) showed that N additions affected the bacterial community primarily by changing the pH, while P additions did so mainly by improving P availability.

Ever-present environmental variation may be one answer to that question. Previous models have demonstrated that species can exploit this variation to coexist with competitors by having different environmental responses (the storage effect). When traits governing species' environmental response can evolve, however, coexistence is not assured. In this study, we use a continuous time, twoseason model to determine the evolutionary outcome of competing species evolving in their seasonal performance trait. We extend the competitive exclusion principle to show that the storage effect can allow no more than N species to coexist on N discrete seasons with no relative nonlinearity. We find a broad region of parameter space where coexistence is evolutionarily stable. The size of this region depends on the period of fluctuations relative to the individual lifespan. Relatively long period fluctuations yield a large coexistence region, but as the period decreases, the region narrows and disappears asymptotically. Finally, we cast our adaptive dynamics technique in terms of Chesson's concept of equalizing and stabilizing mechanisms to demonstrate that the breakdown in coexistence at short periods is due to loss of the stabilizing covariance between the environment and competition.","2017",NA,"10.1007/s12080-016-0314-z","WOS:000397924000007"

A yet-to-be-cultured phylotype of Bacteroidales (GenBank ID: GU389558.1) is implicated as a strong competitor for carbohydrates. Moreover, biogas-producing rate and methane content were significantly related with the abundances of functional populations rather than any operational or physicochemical parameter, revealing microbiological mediation of methanogenesis. Combined, this study enriches our understandings of biological and environmental drivers of microbial community assembly and performance in anaerobic digesters.","2017",NA,"10.1021/acs.est.6b06344","WOS:000398646500044"

We investigated the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) community, which has potential to stabilize alpine ecosystems. ECM communities associated with Larix chinensis were studied in four zones along a natural ecotone from a mixed forest stand over pure forest stands, the timberline, and eventually, the treeline (3050-3450 m) in Tabai Mountain, China. Sixty operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of ECM fungi were identified by sequencing the rDNA internal transcribed spacer of ECM tips. The richness of ECM species increased with elevation. The soil C/N ratio was the most important factor explaining ECM species richness. The treeline zone harbored some unique ECM fungi whereas no unique genera were observed in the timberline and pure forest zone. Elevation and topography were equally important factors influencing ECM communities in the alpine region. We suggest that a higher diversity of the ECM fungal community associated with L. chinensis in the treeline zone could result from niche differentiation.","2017",NA,"10.1007/s00572-017-0766-z","WOS:000403452500007"

We sampled pots of soil at varying times following an initial simulated mass mortality event. Soil DNA was extracted at intervals up to 24 weeks after the event, and shotgun metagenomes sequenced using NextSeq. Compared to initial conditions, we found: consistent, sequential changes in functional metagenome and community structure over time, indicating successional niche differentiation amongst soil biota. As predicted, early successional systems had greater abundance of genes associated with motility, but fewer genes relating to DNA/RNA/ protein metabolism, cell division and cell cycle. Contrary to predictions, there were no significant differences in cell signaling, virulence and defense-related genes. Also, stress related genes were less abundant in later succession. The early successional system had lower taxonomic diversity but higher functional gene diversity. Over time, community characteristics changed progressively, but by the end of the experiment had not returned to the 'original' state of the system before disturbance. Results indicated a predictable sequence of gene functions and taxa following disturbance, analogous to ecosystem succession for large organisms.

While new information has allowed functional groups to be refined, they still rely on a priori knowledge of enzymes involved and the assumption of functional conservation, with little connection to the role the transformations, plays for specific organisms. Here, we use soil microcosms to test the impact of N deposition on prokaryotic communities. By combining chemical, genomic and transcriptomic analysis, we are able to identify and link changes in community structure to specific organisms catalysing given chemical reactions. Urea deposition led to a decrease in prokaryotic richness, and a shift in community composition. This was driven by replacement of stable native populations, which utilize energy from N-linked redox reactions for physiological maintenance, with fast responding populations that use this energy for growth. This model can be used to predict response to N disturbances and allows us to identify putative life strategies of different functional and taxonomic groups, thus providing insights into how they persist in ecosystems by niche differentiation.","2017",NA,"10.1111/mec.14275","WOS:000413927700010"

Heavy-metal proportioning did not significantly influence microbial diversity as Cu and Zn were immobilised at all depths. Proteobacteria were abundant in the top water and the WSI layers, whereas Firmicutes and Bacteroida dominated down-core.

Here we compare the relationship between the plant community and four microarthropod groups (oribatid, mesostigmatic and prostigmatic mites and Collembola) in alpine moss sedge heath. We assess the relative importance of plant growth forms (PGF), mean vegetation chemistry and plant community composition in influencing the microarthropod community composition. Microarthropod and plant community composition was recorded at 15 alpine Racomitrium lanuginosum heath sites in the UK. The correlation between the microarthropod community and the plant community was 0.76, 0.44, 0.34 and 0.59 for Oribatida, Prostigmata, Mesostigmata and Collembola, respectively (Procrustes analysis). Plant species composition was More important in determining community composition for microarthropods that are herbivores/fungivoresidetritivores (Oribatida and Prostigmata and Collembola) than PGF or vegetation chemistry. Predatory microarthropods (Mesostigmata) were influenced by PGF, but not plant species composition or vegetation chemistry. This may reflect the importance of physical habitat structure for these species. We conclude that there is a strong relationship between the plant community composition and the soil microarthropod community but measures such as PGF or mean vegetation chemistry are too coarse to be useful in predicting the microarthropod community composition, because mites respond strongly to heterogeneity between plant species.

We used a long-term soil chronosequence from primary broadleaved forest to moso bamboo forest to examine the changes in AMF abundance and communities, as well as their role in soil C storage. AMF communities showed strong niche differentiation, and were highly structured by forest type (r (2) = 0.648, P = 0.001), and marginally correlated to soil pH and organic C. Bamboo forest expansion increased soil AMF biomass as indicated by neutral lipid fatty acids (NLFA) 16:1 omega 5 abundance, easily extracted glomalin-related soil protein (EE-GRSP), and water-stable macroaggregates. We observed that soil AMF biomass contributed substantially to both soil macroaggregates and EE-GRSP, which were tightly correlated with soil organic C. The influence of bamboo forest expansion on soil C sequestration was mainly due to its indirect effect on AMF biomass. Bamboo forest expansion significantly changed soil AMF communities and increased AMF biomass, which in turn contributed to enhanced soil aggregation and C storage.","2017",NA,"10.1007/s11104-017-3415-6","WOS:000416861200029"

Treatments, including repeated fertilization with ammonium and urea, had no effect on nitrification and crop N status after 3 to 5 crop cycles. Nitrification was actually higher at low than medium ammonium level. The nitrifying community was always dominated by ammonia oxidizing archaea and Nitrospira. However, the abundances of ammonia oxidizing bacteria, AOB, and Nitrobacter increased with fertilization after 5 crop cycles. Several AOB populations, some affiliated to Nitrosospira strains with urease activity or adapted to fluctuating ammonium levels, emerged in fertilized plots, which was correlated to nitrifying community ability to benefit from fertilization. In these soils, dominant nitrifiers adapted to very low ammonium levels have to be replaced by high-N nitrifiers before fertilization can stimulate nitrification. Our results show that the delay required for this replacement is much longer than ever observed for other terrestrial ecosystems, i.e. >5 crop cycles, and demonstrate for the first time that nitrifier characteristics jeopardize the efficiency of fertilization in moist savanna soils.","2017",NA,"10.1038/s41598-017-10185-5","WOS:000408781200134"

A 3 yr time series of phytoplankton abundance assessed by flow cytometry was combined with a selection of traits related to resource utilization (light and in organic nutrients), grazing resistance, and maximum growth, mainly sourced from the literature. Our results showed that the identified functional groups (FGs) ranged deterministically along a temporal gradient of light and nutrient availability, according to several fundamental trade-offs. These trade-offs, which reflected different ecological strategies, were distributed along 1 axis of niche differentiation. This favoured different FGs through time, and consequently allowed them to partition those available resources. The observed functional divergence of the phytoplankton community deviated from that of the expected, random one. It showed that as light increased, the phytoplankton community assembly was mainly driven by competition and grazing pressure, which eventually favoured those FGs that were fastest growing and less vulnerable to predation. Structural equation modeling evidenced that a phytoplankton community, functionally dominated by FGs that were relatively large, fast-growing, and well-adapted to higher light, promoted NUE. Together, these results confirmed the potential use of laboratory-measured functional traits to explore environment-trait linkages in phytoplankton. They also showed the possibility of further extending this approach to identify the mechanisms driving phytoplankton community assembly, structure, and related ecosystem processes.","2017",NA,"10.3354/meps11974","WOS:000395424200004"

Next generation sequencing approaches were used to investigate changes in microbial functional groups during ecosystem development, in response to climate change, in northern boreal wetlands. A gradient of wetlands that developed following permafrost degradation was used to characterize changes in the soil microbial communities that mediate C cycling: a bog representing an undisturbed system with intact permafrost, and a younger bog and an older bog that formed following the disturbance of permafrost thaw. Reference 16S rRNA databases and several diversity indices were used to assess structural differences among these communities, to assess relationships between soil microbial community composition and various environmental variables including redox potential and pH. Rates of potential CO2 and CH4 gas production were quantified to correlate sequence data with gas flux. The abundance of organic C degraders was highest in the youngest bog, suggesting higher rates of microbial processes, including potential CH4 production. In addition, alpha diversity was also highest in the youngest bog, which seemed to be related to a more neutral pH and a lower redox potential. These results could potentially be driven by increased niche differentiation in anaerobic soils.

Marsh bluegrass (Poa leptocoma) commonly hosts a vertically transmitted fungal endophyte (EpichloA << sp.) and naturally grows in wetter conditions than does nodding bluegrass (Poa reflexa), which lacks an epichloid endophyte. We investigated the novel hypothesis that endophyte symbiosis promotes host fitness under flooded conditions, contributing to niche differentiation between the two bluegrass species. We used a factorial greenhouse experiment to test whether endophyte presence improved survival, growth, or reproduction of P. leptocoma under flooded versus non-flooded edaphic conditions by experimentally removing the endophyte from half of the plants. We compared P. leptocoma responses to those of the endophyte-free congener. In contrast to expectations generated from the natural distributions of the two plant species, endophyte presence was more beneficial to P. leptocoma under ambient soil moisture than under flooding. Increased benefits of symbiosis in drier soils are consistent with studies of other grass endophytes. Flooded soils also unexpectedly improved the growth of P. reflexa more than that of the wet habitat specialist, P. leptocoma. While our results demonstrate an overall benefit of fungal symbiosis in this system, ecological factors other than flooding per se likely underlie the observed geographical distributions of these congeneric grasses in nature.","2017",NA,"10.1007/s11258-017-0723-0","WOS:000401435100007"

Nitrification was conventionally assumed as a two-step process in which ammonia oxidation was thought to be catalyzed by ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB), as well as nitrite oxidation by nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB). This long-held assumption of labour division between the two functional groups, however, was challenged by the recent unexpected discovery of complete ammonia oxidizers within the Nitrospira genus that are capable of converting ammonia to nitrate in a single organism (comammox). This breakthrough raised fundamental questions on the niche specialization and differentiation of comammox organisms with other canonical nitrifying prokaryotes in terrestrial ecosystems. This article provides an overview of the recent insights into the genomic analysis, physiological characterization and environmental investigation of the comammox organisms, which have dramatically changed our perspective on the aerobic nitrification process. By using quantitative PCR analysis, we also compared the abundances of comammox Nitrospira clade A and clade B, AOA, AOB and NOB in 300 forest soil samples from China spanning a wide range of soil pH. Comammox Nitrospira are environmentally widespread and numerically abundant in natural and engineered habitats. Physiological data, including ammonia oxidation kinetics and metabolic versatility, and comparative genomic analysis revealed that comammox organisms might functionally outcompete other canonical nitrifiers under highly oligotrophic conditions.

Our goal was to determine whether differences in foraging behaviors were correlated with differences in sighting frequency and overall usage of St. George Sound by the two groups. We used carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur stable isotopes and niche hypervolume metrics to model the foodweb of St. George Sound. Mixing model results indicated that croaker, mojarra, pigfish, pinfish, and silverperch were the most important prey items for dolphins. The hypervolume metrics demonstrate niche partitioning between HSFs and LSFs, with the HSFs relying more heavily on pinfish, pigfish, and mojarra, while the LSFs relied more on silverperch. Plankton, benthic diatoms, seagrass, and epiphytes all contributed to secondary production within St. George Sound. This diversity of source utilization by seagrass-associated consumers supported by a high rate of total production likely sustains high secondary productivity despite the potential for competition in this system. Zooplankton was the most important basal source to the system, followed by seagrass and benthic primary production (as indicated by a sanddollar proxy). The reliance of dolphins on seagrass-dependent prey indicates that alteration of seagrass habitat would significantly impact the dolphin community foraging in St. George Sound and suggests that preservation of seagrass habitat is an important component of an effective management strategy for dolphin populations in the region.","2017",NA,"10.3389/fmars.2017.00235","WOS:000457690600233"

To comprehensively understand the genetic principles governing the composition and co-occurrence patterns of the rhizosphere microbiota, the bacterial communities in the rhizospheres of 12 rabbiteye blueberry (RB) cultivars along with their counterparts in the blackberry rhizosphere and bulk soil were characterized to assess the relative influence of edaphic properties and plant cultivars. The composition and network structure of bacterial community were examined using Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA gene, coupled with co -occurrence networks analysis. The diversity and composition of rhizosphere bacteria community depended more on the interactions with the soil environment (pH and organic carbon) than with the host cultivars. The bacterial assemblages within the blueberry cultivars clearly clustered into three groups (BRI, BRII and RBIII). The bacterial community composition in RBIII, with a higher abundance of Gammaproteobacteria but a lower abundance of Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria, remarkably differed from that in RBI and RBII. Rhizobiales and Pseudomonadaceae predominated in the obtained rhizosphere core microbiota within the plant cultivars. The rhizosphere froth the plant cultivars exerted substantial effects on bacterial association networks and putative keystone species. Intra and inter-phylutn/class co-occurrence in blueberry networks higher than expected by chance was induced by their common ecological niche differentiation or synergistic relationships. Taken together, a comprehensive understanding of the rhizosphere associated bacterial community structure and interaction networks is imperative to elucidate the biological mechanisms guiding bacterial assembly in the rhizosphere.

Understanding soil management consequences for nitrifier ecology could improve nitrogen (N) fertilizer use, decrease NO3- leaching, and minimize NO and N2O emissions. This study examined how long-term N fertilization and tillage influenced nitrifier density, ratios, and nitrification rate. The study site had > 40 years of continuous maize (Zea mays L.) with three nitrogen fertilization rates (0, 168, and 336 kg ha(-1)) and either no-tillage or plow tillage. The Most Probable Number (MPN) method was used to estimate the cell density of ammonia-oxidizing (AOB) and nitrite-oxidizing (NOB) bacteria and the shaken slurry method was used to measure potential nitrification rates. Tillage, fertilization, and their interaction significantly influenced the ammonia oxidizer and nitrite oxidizer cell densities and the potential nitrification rate. Nitrifier cell densities increased with increased nitrogen fertilization; nitrite oxidizer density increased more than ammonia oxidizer density leading to a decreasing AOB: NOB ratio. There were positive correlations between ammonia oxidizer and nitrite oxidizer cell densities, especial in plow tillage. The trends for nitrifier cell density and potential nitrification rate were not consistent. Fertilization increased ammonia oxidizer and nitrite oxidizer densities and potential nitrification rate, but the influence of tillage differed for different fertilization rates. This long-term field trial demonstrated that specific soil management practices differentially influence not only the cell density of nitrifiers, but their relative ratios and their response to increased inorganic nitrogen in the environment.","2017",NA,"10.1016/j.apsoil.2017.07.034","WOS:000411866600015"

Such stimulation, however, depends on manure distribution and the duration of its decomposition in soil. For the first time, we investigated the spatio-temporal patterns of enzyme activities as affected by manure application strategies: 1) Localized manure: manure application as a layer in the upper soil; 2) Homogenized manure: mixing manure throughout the soil; and 3) Control without manure. Tibetan barley was planted on soil managed with yak manure from the Tibetan Plateau. Soil zymography was used to visualize the two-dimensional distribution and dynamics of the activities of three enzymes responsible for cycling of carbon beta-glucosidase), nitrogen (N-acetylglucosaminidase) and phosphorus (phosphomonoesterase) over 45 days. The manure detritusphere increased enzyme activities relative to the control (which had only the rhizosphere effect of barley) and this stimulation lasted less than 45 days. Enzyme activities in the manure-induced hotspots were higher than on the barley rhizoplane, indicating that the detritusphere stimulated microbial activities more strongly than roots. Homogenized manure led to 3-29% higher enzyme activities than localized manure, but shoot and root biomass was respectively 3.1 and 6.7 times higher with localized manure application. Nutrients released by high enzyme activities within the whole soil volume will be efficiently trapped by microorganisms. In contrast, nutrients released from manure locally are in excess for microbial uptake and remain available for roots. Consequently, microorganisms were successful competitors for nutrients from homogeneous manure application, while plants benefited more from localized manure application. We conclude that localized manure application decreases competition for nutrients between the microbial community of manure and the roots, and thereby increases plant performance.

Medicago sativa ('lucerne') and Dactylis glomerata ('cocksfoot') were grown as sole crops or intercropped in soils with or without addition of biogas digestate to also evaluate fertilizer effects. Eight genes involved in inorganic N-cycling were quantified using real-time PCR to determine the genetic potential for different N-cycling pathways. Both plant species and intercropping affected the abundance of root-associated microbial-derived genes involved in N-cycling processes, while there was no effect of amendment with biogas digestate. The genetic potential for the various pathways differed between bulk soil and roots, as well as between the roots of the two plant species, suggesting that organisms involved in different N-cycling processes were favored in different compartments in the soil-root environment. Ammonia oxidizers involved in nitrification, a pathway resulting in N-leaching, dominated in soil whereas those related to N-2 fixation and gaseous N losses (denitrification) were more abundant on roots. We also observed niche differentiation between the two major groups of organisms with the capacity to reduce N2O in the root- and soil compartment. Legume-grass intercropping resulted in a decreasing trend for several root- associated functional communities.

This methanotrophic metabolism has been linked to consortia of anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea (ANME) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). These two groups are the focus of numerous studies; however, less is known about the wide diversity of other seep associated microorganisms. We selected a hierarchical set of FISH probes targeting a range of Deltaproteobacterta diversity. Using the Magneto-FISH enrichment technique, we then magnetically captured CARD-FISH hybridized cells and their physically associated microorganisms from a methane seep sediment incubation. DNA from nested Magneto-FISH experiments was analyzed using Illumina tag 16S rRNA gene sequencing (iTag). Enrichment success and potential bias with iTag was evaluated in the context of full-length 16S rRNA gene clone libraries, CARD-FISH, functional gene clone libraries, and iTag mock communities. We determined commonly used Earth Microbiome Project (EMP) iTAG primers introduced bias in some common methane seep microbial taxa that reduced the ability to directly compare OTU relative abundances within a sample, but comparison of relative abundances between samples (in nearly all cases) and whole community-based analyses were robust. The iTag dataset was subjected to statistical co-occurrence measures of the most abundant OTUs to determine which taxa in this dataset were most correlated across fall samples. Many non-canonical microbial partnerships were statistically significant in our co-occurrence network analysis, most of which were not recovered with conventional clone library sequencing, demonstrating the utility of combining Magneto-FISH and iTag sequencing methods for hypothesis generation lof associations within complex microbial communities. Network analysis pointed to many co-occurrences containing putatively heterotrophic, candidate phyla such as OD1, Atribacteria, MBG-B, and Hyd24-12 and the potential for complex sulfur cycling involving Epsilon-, Delta-, and Garnmaproteobacteria in methane seep ecosystems.","2016",NA,"10.7717/peerj.1913","WOS:000374374300007"

The large C and N stocks in forest soils complicate research on the effects of tree species on C and N pools. In-situ C-13 and N-15 labeling in undisturbed, natural forests enable not only tracing of C and N fluxes, but also reveal insight into the interactions at the plant-soil-atmosphere interface. In-situ dual C-13 and N-15 pulse labeling of 20 beeches (Fagus sylvatica L.) and 20 ashes (Fraxinus excelsior L.) allowed tracing the fate of assimilated C and N in trees and soils in an unmanaged forest system in the Hainich National Park (Germany). Leaf, stem, root, and soil samples as well as microbial biomass were analyzed to quantify the allocation of 13C and N-15 for 60 d after labeling and along spatial gradients in the soil with increasing distance from the stem. For trees of similar heights (approximate to 4 m), beech (20%) assimilated twice as much as ash (9%) of the applied (CO2)-C-13, but beech and ash incorporated similar N-15 amounts (45%) into leaves. The photosynthates were transported belowground through the phloem more rapidly in beech than in ash. Ash preferentially accumulated N-15 and C-13 in the roots. In contrast, beech released more of this initially assimilated C-13 (2.0% relative C-13 allocation) and N-15 (0.1% relative N-15 allocation) via rhizodeposition into the soil than ash (0.2% relative C-13, 0.04% relative N-15 allocation), which was also subsequently recovered in microbial biomass. These results on C and N partitioning contribute to an improved understanding of the effects of European beech and ash on the C and N cycles in deciduous broad-leaved forest. Differences in C and N allocation patterns between ash and beech are one mechanism of niche differentiation in forests containing both species.","2016",NA,"10.1002/jpln.201500384","WOS:000377268800007"

Recent studies have demonstrated in short-term experiments that organisms of the genotype 'Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis' clade I and II, known to express the polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAO) phenotype can switch to the GAO phenotype when poly-P is absent, but are performing the HAc-uptake at lower kinetic rates, where clade I showed the lowest rates. The objective of this study was to verify whether organisms of the genotype 'Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis' can also be enriched under P-limiting conditions while expressing a GAO phenotype and more specifically to see which specific clade prevails. A sequencing batch reactor was inoculated with activated sludge to enrich an EBPR culture for a cultivation period of 128 days (16 times the solids retention time) under P-limiting conditions. A mixed culture was obtained comprising of 49 % 'Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis' clade II and 46 % 'Candidatus Competibacter phosphatis'. The culture performed a full GAO metabolism for anaerobic HAc-uptake, but was still able to switch to a PAO metabolism, taking up excessive amounts of phosphate during the aerobic phase when it became available in the influent. These findings show that P-limitation, often used as strategy for enrichment of 'Candidatus Competibacter phosphatis', does not always lead to enrichment of only 'Candidatus Competibacter phosphatis'. Furthermore, it demonstrates that 'Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis' are able to proliferate in activated sludge systems for periods of up to 128 days or longer when the influent phosphate concentrations are just enough for assimilation purposes and no poly-P is formed. The 'Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis' retain the ability to switch to the PAO phenotype, taking up phosphate from the influent as soon as it becomes available.","2016",NA,"10.1186/s13568-016-0214-z","WOS:000380006500001"

The food webs of five seep and four vent assemblages were studied using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses. Although the two ecosystems shared similar potential basal sources, their food webs differed: seeps relied predominantly on methanotrophy and thiotrophy via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham(CBB) cycle and vents on petroleum-derived organic matter and thiotrophy via the CBB and reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycles. In contrast to symbiotic species, the heterotrophic fauna exhibited high trophic flexibility among assemblages, suggesting weak trophic links to the metabolic diversity of chemosynthetic primary producers. At both ecosystems, food webs did not appear to be organised through predator-prey links but rather through weak trophic relationships among co-occurring species. Examples of trophic or spatial niche differentiation highlighted the importance of species-sorting processes within chemo-synthetic ecosystems. Variability in food web structure, addressed through Bayesian metrics, revealed consistent trends across ecosystems. Food-web complexity significantly decreased with increasing methane concentrations, a common proxy for the intensity of seep and vent fluid fluxes. Although high fluid-fluxes have the potential to enhance primary productivity, they generate environmental constraints that may limit microbial diversity, colonisation of consumers and the structuring role of competitive interactions, leading to an overall reduction of food-web complexity and an increase in trophic redundancy. Heterogeneity provided by foundation species was identified as an additional structuring factor. According to their biological activities, foundation species may have the potential to partly release the competitive pressure within communities of low fluid-flux habitats. Finally, ecosystem functioning in vents and seeps was highly similar despite environmental differences (e.g. physico-chemistry, dominant basal sources) suggesting that ecological niches are not specifically linked to the nature of fluids. This comparison of seep and vent functioning in the Guaymas basin thus provides further supports to the hypothesis of continuity among deep-sea chemosynthetic ecosystems.","2016",NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0162263","WOS:000384171400007"

We investigated the heterogeneity within and between three Sphagnum microhabitats (Sphagnum lawn: apical green part, decomposing brown part; submerged Sphagnum) and the heterogeneity of potential consumers (oribatid mites) in two German peatlands (Dubringer Moor, Klockenbruch) using stable isotopes (N-15, C-13). Small-scale heterogeneity of the potential food resource (Sphagnum sp.) in N-15 and C-13 was high. The heterogeneity of N-15 signatures of Sphagnum sp. was transferred to oribatid mite taxa indicating that Sphagnum sp. is their basal food resource. The close relationship between stable isotopes ratios in Sphagnum sp. and oribatid mites on the scale of a few meters furthermore points to the low mobility of mites. When oribatid mites where aggregated into trophic levels, the strongest correlation occurred between N-15 in Sphagnum sp. and oribatid mites of the first trophic level. Oribatid mites spanned 9.1 delta N-15 and 4.4 delta C-13 units in the Dubringer Moor and 9.5 delta N-15 and 4.7 delta C-13 units in the Klockenbruch indicating that they span over about three trophic levels. Three oribatid mite species (Rhysotritia ardua, Hydrozetes lacustris, Pergalumna nervosa) were trophic generalists whereas eleven other species (e.g. Hoplophthiracarus illinoisensis, Hypochthonius rufulus) had rather narrow trophic ranges as indicated by variance in N-15 and C-13 signatures. Isotopic signatures of similar oribatid mites collected in the green and brown parts of the Sphagnum lawn were rather close together suggesting that they use the same food sources. In the Sphagnum lawn, oribatid mites low in the food web were primary decomposers such as Platynothrus peltifer and Nothrus pratensis, whereas Oppiella spp. had high delta N-15 signatures pointing to fungal feeding or predation/scavenging. Limnozetes rugosus and Hydrozetes lacustris had the highest N-15 signatures indicating that these taxa are high in the food web possibly feeding on protozoans and nematodes living in the biofilm on the stems and branches of Sphagnum sp.

Here we investigated an area of the Northwestern Black Sea off Crimea close to the shelf break, where the chemocline reaches the seafloor at around 150-170 m water depth, to assess whether thiotrophic bacteria are favored in this zone. Seafloor video transects were carried out with the submersible JAGO covering 20 km2 on the region between 110 and 200 m depth. Around the chemocline we observed irregular seafloor depressions, covered with whitish mats of large filamentous bacteria. These comprised 25-55% of the seafloor, forming a belt of 3 km width around the chemocline. Cores from the mats obtained with JAGO showed higher accumulations of organic matter under the mats compared to mat-free sediments. The mat-forming bacteria were related to Beggiatoa-like large filamentous sulfur bacteria based on 16S rRNA sequences from the mat, and visual characteristics. The microbial community under the mats was significantly different from the surrounding sediments and enriched with taxa affiliated with polymer degrading, fermenting and sulfate reducing microorganisms. Under the mats, higher organic matter accumulation, as well as higher remineralization and radiotracer-based sulfate reduction rates were measured compared to outside the mat. Mat-covered and mat-free sediments showed similar degradability of the bulk organic matter pool, suggesting that the higher sulfide fluxes and subsequent development of the thiotrophic mats in the patches are consequences of the accumulation of organic matter rather than its qualitative composition. Our observations suggest that the key factors for the distribution of thiotrophic mat-forming communities near to the Crimean shelf break are hypoxic conditions that (i) repress grazers, (ii) enhance the accumulation and degradation of labile organic matter by sulfate-reducers, and (iii) favor thiotrophic filamentous bacteria which are adapted to exploit steep gradients in oxygen and sulfide availability; in addition to a specific seafloor topography which may relate to internal waves at the shelf break.","2016",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2016.01011","WOS:000378682600001"

AOM is largely mediated by consortia of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), and has mainly been investigated in deep-sea sediments. Here we studied methane seepage at four spots located at 12 m water depth in coastal, organic carbon depleted permeable sands off the Island of Elba (Italy). We combined biogeochemical measurements, sequencing-based community analyses and in situ hybridization to investigate the microbial communities of this environment. Increased alkalinity, formation of free sulfide and nearly stoichiometric methane oxidation and sulfate reduction rates up to 200 nmol g(-1) day(-1) indicated the predominance of sulfate-coupled AOM. With up to 40 cm thickness the zones of AOM activity were unusually large and occurred in deeper sediment horizons (20-50 cm below seafloor) as compared to diffusion-dominated deep-sea seeps, which is likely caused by advective flow of pore water due to the shallow water depth and permeability of the sands. Hydrodynamic forces also may be responsible for the substantial phylogenetic and unprecedented morphological diversity of AOM consortia inhabiting these sands, including the Glades ANME-1a/b, ANME-2a/b/c, ANME-3, and their partner bacteria SEEP-SRB1a and SEEP-SRB2. High microbial dispersal, the availability of diverse energy sources and high habitat heterogeneity might explain that the emission spots shared few microbial taxa, despite their physical proximity. Although the biogeochemistry of this shallow methane seep was very different to that of deep-sea seeps, their key functional taxa were very closely related, which supports the global dispersal of key taxa and underlines strong selection by methane as the predominant energy source. Mesophilic, methane-fueled ecosystems in shallow-water permeable sediments may comprise distinct microbial habitats due to their unique biogeochemical and physical characteristics. To link AOM phylotypes with seep habitats and to enable future meta-analyses we thus propose that seep environment ontology needs to be further specified.","2016",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2016.00374","WOS:000373275700001"

Functional segregation is discussed through resource competition. The niche of a structured population is composed of the niches of its i-states.

Understanding the impact of alternative fertility sources on the ecology of the soil nitrogen cycle has potential to allow for management that will increase crop N uptake and reduce loss. We determined how repeated applications of urea, composted chicken litter, hairy vetch green manure with alfalfa meal, and an unfertilized control affected the structure and potential nitrification activity (PNA) of ammonia oxidizers in bulk and rhizosphere soil when N needs were expected to be high. PNA was greater in animal and green manure treatments relative to urea and the unfertilized control in bulk soil, and greater in the rhizosphere relative to bulk soil regardless of fertility treatment. A strong correlation was observed between PNA and ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) abundance, suggesting that AOB rather than ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) controlled nitrification in this system. However, AOB abundance did not differ between bulk and rhizosphere soil, and PNA was lower in the urea treatment despite greater AOB abundance indicating that other factors could have affected PNA. For example, greater availability of labile carbon (C) could have stimulated PNA through various mechanisms, and lower pH and/or specific nitrification potential per AOB cell could have reduced PNA in the urea treatment. AOB community structure was more diverse in all fertility treatments relative to the unfertilized control in bulk soil, and community structure differed between bulk and rhizosphere soil indicating niche differentiation. However, differences in AOB community structure and PNA were only observed in rhizosphere relative to bulk soil indicating that the rhizosphere had a greater effect on nitrification dynamics than fertility practices. These findings indicate that organic fertility amendments stimulate PNA, but they could also increase N loss and should be investigated further. The rhizosphere appears to play a greater role in nitrification dynamics than fertility practices, and more detailed investigations at this key plant-soil interface are warranted.

A central goal in ecology is to understand how processes such as species interactions and dispersal, contribute to observed patterns of species abundance and distribution. Our objectives were to assess the effects of sediment resuspension on microalgal community structure. We tested whether taxa-abundance distributions could be predicted using neutral community models (NCMs) and also specific hypotheses about passive migration: (i) As migration decreases in sediment patches, BMA -diversity will decrease, and (ii) As migration decreases, BMA community dissimilarity (-diversity) will increase. Co-occurrence indices (checkerboard score and variance ratio) were also computed to test for deterministic factors, such as competition and niche differentiation, in shaping communities. Two intertidal sites (mudflat and sand bar) differing in resuspension regime were sampled throughout the tidal cycle. Fluorometry and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis were utilized to investigate diatom community structure. Observed taxa-abundances fit those predicted from NCMs reasonably well (R-2 of 0.68-0.93), although comparisons of observed local communities to artificial randomly assembled communities rejected the null hypothesis that diatom communities were assembled solely by stochastic processes. No co-occurrence tests indicated a significant role for competitive exclusion or niche partitioning in microalgal community assembly. In general, predictions about relationships between migration and species diversity were supported for local community dynamics. BMA at low tide (lowest migration) exhibited reduced -diversity as compared to periods of immersion at both mudflat and sand bar sites. -diversity was higher during low tide emersion on the mudflat, but did not differ temporally at the sand bar site. In between-site metacommunity comparisons, low- and high-resuspension sites exhibited distinct community compositions while the low-energy mudflats contained higher microalgal biomass and greater -diversity. To our knowledge this is the first study to test the relevance of neutral processes in structuring marine microalgal communities. Our results demonstrate a prominent role for stochastic factors in structuring local BMA community assembly, although unidentified nonrandom processes also appear to play some role. High passive migration, in particular, appears to help maintain species diversity and structure communities in both sand and muddy habitats.","2016",NA,"10.1111/jpy.12445","WOS:000387414800012"

However, we do not understand whether sample storage methods confound the ability to investigate interindividual variation in gut microbiome profiles. Here, we extend previous work on storage methods for gut microbiome samples by comparing immediate freezing, the gold standard of preservation, to three methods commonly used in vertebrate field studies: lyophilization, storage in ethanol, and storage in RNAlater. We found that the signature of individual identity consistently outweighed storage effects: alpha diversity and beta diversity measures were significantly correlated across methods, and while samples often clustered by donor, they never clustered by storage method. Provided that all analyzed samples are stored the same way, banked fecal samples therefore appear highly suitable for investigating variation in gut microbiota. Our results open the door to a much-expanded perspective on variation in the gut microbiome across species and ecological contexts.","2016",NA,"10.1038/srep31519","WOS:000381460100001"

Formulae were prepared using thermosensitive (PF127 and PF68) or ion-activated (Gelrite) polymers. They were evaluated for gelation temperature (GT), capacity, content uniformity, pH, rheological behavior, in vitro drug release with kinetic analysis. Best formulae were exposed to storage effect to select the optimum formula that was subjected to different sterilization methods and in vivo evaluation. The prepared disappearing preservative (sodium perborate monohydrate) proved to be active oxidative preservative and compatible with our formulae. F9 (24% PF127, 15% PF 68, 0.5% levofloxacin hemihydrate, and 0.0025% sodium perborate monohydrate) showed prolonged drug release (12h), acceptable GT, viscosity, and pH. It remained stable over 3 months at two temperatures and was best sterilized by filtration. It showed longer residence time (12h) in rabbits' eye fluids compared with the Levoxin (R) eye drops (4h). This successful attempt of using thermo-gelling system along with a disappearing type of preservatives would allow the use of these systems to achieve sustained release of antimicrobial drugs with minimum risk of eye damage improving patient compliance and treatment efficacy.","2016",NA,"10.3109/10837450.2015.1035728","WOS:000375462900010"

Longterm storage of seeds is very important for the continuity of life. Seed storage time heavily depends on plant species, seed maturation degree, preliminary processing, seed germination value and the moisture content. Environmental conditions such as temperature of the storage place, humidity, and light, or infestation of parasitic living beings; insects and fungus are some other first order parameters responsible for the seed storage time, too. Germinated and bug infested seeds are neither suitable for food consumption nor for cultivation. Automated discrimination of these situations with respect to healthy seeds requires an algorithm to be applied in the sense of seed image classification. This paper draws some image processing related steps to be applied for seed images which discriminate the germinated or bug infested ones. The problem itself stems from the seed type, the reason why some seed variations like beans show close texture to germinated sprouts. The experiments are handled by using some sort of seed types readily available in the seedsman such as lentil, chickpea, bean, corn, barley, cowpea, and wheat seeds. Each of the training and test pictures is obtained in an uncontrolled environment without the care of light and image acquisition details that makes the problem tougher. A brand-new database namely ITUSEED-II has already been constructed. The analysis of database related to healthy and badly conditioned seeds using a new computer vision method namely Relational Bit Operator (RBO) is presented in this paper.","2016",NA,NA,"WOS:000391252300001"

Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was utilized to predict the physicochemical and microbiological parameters of these partially dried cherry tomatoes during storage. Satisfactory accuracies were obtained when ANFIS was used to predict the lycopene and total phenolic contents, color and microbial contamination. The coefficients of determination for all the ANFIS models were higher than 0.86 and showed better performance for prediction compared with models developed by response surface methodology. Through ANFIS modeling, the effects of storage conditions on the properties of partially dried cherry tomatoes were visualized. Generally, contents of lycopene and total phenolics decreased with the increase in water activity, temperature and storage time, while aerobic plate count and number of yeasts and molds increased at high water activities and temperatures. Overall, ANFIS approach can be used as an effective tool to study the quality decrease and microbial pollution of partially dried cherry tomatoes during storage, as well as identify the suitable preservation conditions.","2016",NA,"10.1007/s13197-016-2339-0","WOS:000387662800006"

Studies testing multiple stressor hypotheses are expensive and time consuming in mammalian model systems; therefore, determining relevance of alternative models is important. Daphnia pulex were fed standard or low-Fe diets of freshwater algae, Ankistrodesmus falcatus. MeHgC1 (1600 ng/L) or vehicle was added to culture media for 24 h during early life, and the combinatorial effects of a low-Fe diet and MeHg exposure on lifespan, maturation time, and reproduction were evaluated. Lipid storage effects were measured using image analysis of Oil Red 0 staining and triacylglyceride quantification. Our results show a dose -dependent reduction in lifespan in D. pulex fed low Fe diets. Lipid analysis suggests an interactive effect of diet and MeHg exposure, with MeHg exposure increasing lipid storage in D. pulex fed a low -Fe diet. These findings suggest the effects of dietary iron intake and early life MeHg exposure in D. pulex may be mediated by changes in energetics that result in differential lipid storage. Therefore, lipid storage in D. pulex may be a useful screen for detecting long-term effects of multiple stressors early in life. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The in situ challenge was performed by water-soaking at 26-28 A degrees C for 7 h to ensure the multiplication and active phase of fish microflora. Right after pre-cooking to back-bone temperature (BBT) of 50-52 A degrees C, histamine dropped to 5.17 A +/- 2.71 ppm, and slowly reached 6.84 A +/- 1.69 ppm at 16 h abuse. On the contrary, histamine was reduced to 2.87 A +/- 1.23 ppm and eventually reached 5.01 A +/- 1.32 ppm at 24 h abuse in the pre-cooked fish previously frozen. The numbers of total aerobic bacteria, Enterobactericeae, psychrotroph, histamine forming bacteria (HFB) and diversity of fish microflora were revealed by cultural and nested PCR-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) techniques. Interestingly, frozen storage effectively halted histamine formation in raw fish throughout 16 h abuse despite the presence of HFB. These included the prolific strains of Morganella morganii, Proteus penneri, Proteus mirabilin, Citrobacter spp. The nested PCR-DGGE profile confirmed the presence of M. morganii and Citrobacter spp. in raw fish. These prolific strains were hardly observed in the precooked fish previously frozen. Frozen storage did not only promote even histamine distribution throughout fish muscle but also enhanced histamine loss during thawing and pre-cooking. Therefore, pre-cooking and frozen storage were proven to be the effective combined hurdles not only to reduce but also prolong histamine formation of the challenged toggol throughout 24 h of temperature abuse during canning process.","2016",NA,"10.1007/s13197-015-2042-6","WOS:000368039600019"

The human associated microbiome is a prominent focus of clinical research. Large cohort studies are often required to investigate the human microbiome composition and its changes in a multitude of human diseases. Reproducible analyses of large cohort samples require standardized protocols in study design, sampling, storage, processing, and data analysis. In particular, the effect of sample storage on actual results is critical for reproducibility. So far, the effect of storage conditions on the results of microbial analysis has been examined for only a few human biological materials (e.g., stool samples). There is a lack of data and information on appropriate storage conditions on other human derived samples, such as skin. Here, we analyzed skin swab samples collected from three different body locations (forearm. V of the chest and back) of eight healthy volunteers. The skin swabs were soaked in sterile buffer and total DNA was isolated after freezing at 80 C for 24 h, 90 or 365 days. Hypervariable regions V1-2 were amplified from total DNA and libraries were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq desktop sequencer in paired end mode. Data were analyzed using Qiime 1.9.1. Summarizing all body locations per time point, we found no significant differences in alpha diversity and multivariate community analysis among the three time points. Considering body locations separately significant differences in the richness of forearm samples were found between dO vs. d90 and d90 vs. d365. Significant differences in the relative abundance of major skin genera (Propionibacterium, Streptococcus, Bacteroides, Corynebacterium, and Staphylococcus) were detected in our samples in Bacteroides only among all time points in forearm samples and between dO vs. d90 and d90 vs. d365 in V of the chest and back samples. Accordingly, significant differences were detected in the ratios of the main phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes: Actinobacteria vs. Bacteroidetes at dO vs. d90 (p-value = 0.0234), at dO vs. d365 (p-value= 0.0234) and d90 vs. d365 (p-value = 0.0234) in forearm samples and at d90 vs. d365 in V of the chest (p-value = 0.0234) and back samples (p-value = 0.0234). The ratios of Firmicutes vs. Bacteroidetes showed no significant changes in any of the body locations as well as the ratios of Actinobacteria vs. Firmicutes at any time point.

Here we tested five methods for preserving human and dog fecal specimens for periods of up to 8 weeks, including such types of variation as freeze-thaw cycles and the high temperature fluctuations often encountered under field conditions. We found that three of the methods-95% ethanol, FTA cards, and the OMNIgene Gut kit-can preserve samples sufficiently well at ambient temperatures such that differences at 8 weeks are comparable to differences among technical replicates. However, even the worst methods, including those with no fixative, were able to reveal microbiome differences between species at 8 weeks and between individuals after a week, allowing meta-analyses of samples collected using various methods when the effect of interest is expected to be larger than interindividual variation (although use of a single method within a study is strongly recommended to reduce batch effects). Encouragingly for FTA cards, the differences caused by this method are systematic and can be detrended. As in other studies, we strongly caution against the use of 70% ethanol. The results, spanning 15 individuals and over 1,200 samples, provide our most comprehensive view to date of storage effects on stool and provide a paradigm for the future studies of other sample types that will be required to provide a global view of microbial diversity and its interaction among humans, animals, and the environment.

Most HCC are associated with well known underlying risk factors, in fact, HCC arise in cirrhotic patients in up to 90% of cases, mainly due to chronic viral hepatitis and alcohol abuse. The worldwide prevention strategies are conducted to avoid the infection of new subjects and to minimize the risk of liver disease progression in infected patients. HCC is a condition which lends itself to surveillance as at-risk individuals can readily be identified. The American and European guidelines recommended implementation of surveillance programs with ultrasound every six months in patient atrisk for developing HCC. The diagnosis of HCC can be based on non-invasive criteria (only in cirrhotic patient) or pathology. Accurately staging patients is essential to oncology practice. The ideal tumour staging system in HCC needs to account for both tumour characteristics and liver function. Treatment allocation is based on several factors: Liver function, size and number of tumours, macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread. The recommendations in terms of selection for different treatment strategies must be based on evidence-based data. Resection, liver transplant and interventional radiology treatment are mainstays of HCC therapy and achieve the best outcomes in well-selected candidates. Chemoembolization is the most widely used treatment for unresectable HCC or progression after curative treatment. Finally, in patients with advanced HCC with preserved liver function, sorafenib is the only approved systemic drug that has demonstrated a survival benefit and is the standard of care in this group of patients.","2016",NA,"10.4254/wjh.v8.i9.421","WOS:000439233000001"
"Chung, YA; Rudgers, JA","Plant-soil feedbacks promote negative frequency dependence in the coexistence of two aridland grasses","PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","Understanding the mechanisms of species coexistence is key to predicting patterns of species diversity. Historically, the ecological paradigm has been that species coexist by partitioning resources: as a species increases in abundance, self-limitation kicks in, because species-specific resources decline. However, determining coexistence mechanisms has been a particular puzzle for sedentary organisms with high overlap in their resource requirements, such as plants. Recent evidence suggests that plant-associated microbes could generate the stabilizing self-limitation (negative frequency dependence) that is required for species coexistence. Here, we test the key assumption that plant microbe feedbacks cause such self-limitation. We used competition experiments and modelling to evaluate how two common groups of soil microbes (rhizospheric microbes and biological soil crusts) influenced the self-limitation of two competing desert grass species. Negative feedbacks between the dominant plant competitor and its rhizospheric microbes magnified self-limitation, whereas beneficial interactions between both plant species and biological soil crusts partly counteracted this stabilizing effect. Plant microbe interactions have received relatively little attention as drivers of vegetation dynamics in dry land ecosystems. Our results suggest that microbial mechanisms can contribute to patterns of plant coexistence in arid grasslands.","2016",NA,"10.1098/rspb.2016.0608","WOS:000382430800007"

We illustrate our ideas with nested SIS models of single and dual colonization, applied to polymorphic pneumococcal bacteria. By fitting the models to cross-sectional prevalence data from Portugal (before and after the introduction of a seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine), we are able to not only statistically compare neutral and non-neutral epidemiological formulations, but also estimate vaccine efficacy, transmission and competition parameters simultaneously.

We tested a research hypothesis that the unexpectedly long delay (nearly two decades) in population development of P. minimum prior to its first bloom was caused by competition with one or several closely related native dinoflagellate species due to ecological niche partitioning which hampered the spread and bloom-forming potential of the invader. We applied the ecological niche concept to a large, long-term phytoplankton database and analysed the invasion history and population dynamics of P. minimum in the SW Baltic Sea coastal waters using the data on phytoplankton composition, abundance and biomass. The ecological niche dimensions of P. minimum and its congener P. balticum were identified as the optimum environmental conditions for the species during the bloom events based on water temperature, salinity, pH, concentration of nutrients (PO43-; total phosphorus, TP; total nitrogen, TN; SiO44-, TN/TP-ratio and habitat type. The data on spatial distribution and ecological niche dimensions of P. minimum have contributed to the development of the protistan species maximum concept. High microplanlcton diversity at critical salinities in the Baltic Sea may be considered as a possible reason for the significant niche overlap and strong competitive interactions among congeners leading to prolonged delay in population growth of P. minimum preceding its first bloom in the highly variable brackishwater environment.

Tadpoles are in general herbivores and consume mostly algae. Despite this, little is known about how specific guilds use resources that are available in the same space and at the same time. It is thought that species of tadpoles segregate based on food use, especially in lotic environments where food resources may be a limiting factor. Conversely, it is believed that the use of food resources is similar among tadpoles with the same ecomorphotype. This study examined the diet of Aplastodiscus cavicola, Aplastodiscus sibilatus and Bokermannohyla capra syntopic tadpoles, as similarities may exist between these benthic species, all of which are adapted to the flow of water. This study was undertaken in the Michelin Ecological Reserve, municipality of Igrapiuna, state of Bahia, Brazil. To analyze the diet of the tadpoles, nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was performed to evaluate the similarity between the diets of the species. Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) was carried out to detect whether diet differed among tadpole species. The diet of these tadpoles consists mainly of algae, especially diatoms, plants, protozoa, fungi and microscopic animals. The NMDS identified three clusters representing the three species studied.

The objectives of the present work were therefore to: (a) compare the nutritional utilisation patterns and rates of uptake of key C-sources in maize by the antagonist C.rosea 016 and that by the pathogen F. verticillioides FV1; (b) examine their Niche Overlap Indices (NOI) under different interacting environmental conditions; and (c) evaluate whether the rate of utilisation of key maize C-sources influenced the competitiveness of either species using the Bioscreen. It was found that water potential (Psi) x temperature interactions had significant impacts on C-source utilisation' patterns by C.rosea 016 and the pathogen. The NOIs, based on the utilisation of the C-sources by each strain divided by those utilised in common, showed that the antagonist and the pathogen occupied similar niches at 0.70 MPa Psi+30 degrees C and 2.8 MPa Psi+25 degrees C. Under the other conditions tested, they appeared to occupy separate niches suggesting niche exclusion. Temporal C-source utilisation patterns were then compared under different (Psi) x temperature treatments. This showed that the dominant maize-based C-sources utilised by the pathogen and the antagonist were different. The pathogen F. verticillioides FV1 utilised carbohydrates rapidly followed by amino acids and then one fatty acid, palmitic acid. The antagonist C.rosea 016 utilised both carbohydrates and amino acids at a similar rate but more slowly than the pathogen. There were also differences in the utilisation of some individual amino acids and carbohydrates which might explain the occupation of different niches under some interacting environmental conditions.

Food webs and trophic dynamics of coastal systems have been the focus of intense research throughout the world, as they prove to be critical in understanding ecosystem processes and functions. However, very few studies have undertaken a quantitative comparison of entire food webs from a key consumer perspective across a broad geographical area, limiting relevant comparisons among systems with distinct biotic and abiotic components. 2. We investigate the structure and functioning of food webs in four tidal ecosystems of international importance for migratory shorebirds along the East Atlantic Flyway: Tejo estuary in Portugal, Sidi Moussa in Morocco, Banc d'Arguin in Mauritania and Bijagos archipelago in Guinea-Bissau. Basal food sources, shorebirds and their prey (benthic invertebrates) were sampled in all areas, and Bayesian stable isotope mixing models and community-wide metrics were used in a comparative analysis among areas. 3. Significant differences among study areas were found in the structure of food webs, as well as in the relative importance of basal resource pools supporting each food web. Overall, the food web of Banc d'Arguin was characterized by lower trophic diversity and higher functional redundancy than the other sites. This result might be explained by the low number of trophic pathways of organic matter transfer in this seagrass-dominated system which, as a fossil estuary, lacks inputs from both freshwater and nutrient-rich offshore oceanic waters. 4. Structure of shorebird communities was consistent with the main organizational patterns found for each food web, highlighting the less diverse character of the community of Banc d'Arguin. At Banc d'Arguin and Bijagos archipelago, which displayed the smallest and largest isotopic niche widths in bird assemblage, respectively, mean niche overlap among species was low, suggesting high interspecific partitioning in resource use. Tropical systems typically offer comparatively lower harvestable prey biomass for shorebirds and might thus strengthen interspecific competition, leading to low niche overlap among species. 5. Our study reveals relevant differences in the structure of food webs and shorebird communities in coastal areas along an avian flyway. While differences in trophic redundancy of food webs point to distinct levels of ecosystem resilience, contrasts in the organization of shorebird communities highlight the plasticity in the foraging behaviour of species inhabiting areas with distinct environmental conditions.","2016",NA,"10.1111/1365-2435.12506","WOS:000372949000014"

We measured the effects of distance from a mature tree on the growth of conspecific seedlings and their belowground interactions (mutualisms and pathogens). We expected that native seedlings growing in close proximity to a mature conspecific tree would more likely be damaged by co-specific pathogens than those growing further away. In contrast, considering that exotic invaders have not coevolved with the local soil pathogens, distance from the adult conspecific tree would not affect their seedlings. We collected undisturbed soil cores at five incremental distances from each adult tree and grew conspecific seeds in these cores. After three months of growth, we measured plant biomass, mycorrhizal root colonization and root lesions. We found that biomass increased with distance from the mature conspecific tree only for A. platanoides and no distance dependent signal was detected for other response variables. Our results show that distance from a conspecific mature tree may not determine exotic species invasibility in an urban forest and that, instead, this may contribute to promote native and invasive species coexistence in urban forest systems.","2016",NA,"10.1007/s11252-015-0507-z","WOS:000382671000028"

The absorptive roots of tree species also vary widely in their diameter. The linkages between root thickness, mycorrhiza type and nutrient foraging are poorly understood. We conducted a large root ingrowth experiment in the field to investigate how absorptive roots of varying thickness and their associated fungi (AM vs. EM) exploit different nutrient patches (inorganic and organic) in a common garden. In nutrient-rich patches, thin-root tree species more effectively proliferated absorptive roots than thick-root tree species, whereas thick-root tree species proliferated more mycorrhizal fungal biomass than thin-root tree species. Moreover, nutrient patches enriched with organic materials resulted in greater root and mycorrhizal fungal proliferation compared to those enriched with inorganic nutrients. Irrespective of root morphology, AM tree species had higher root foraging precision than mycorrhizal hyphae foraging precision within organic patches, whereas EM tree species exhibited the opposite. Our findings that roots and mycorrhizal fungi are complementary in foraging within nutrient patches provide new insights into species coexistence and element cycling in terrestrial ecosystems.","2016",NA,"10.1002/ecy.1514","WOS:000386088000027"

Three times during the growing season (i.e., June, July, and September), these plots were injected with N-15-labeled NO3--N, NH4+-N, or glycine-N, or with only water as a control. Two hours after N-15 injection, exchangeable NH4+-N, glycine-N, and NO3--N as well as plant and soil samples were collected and analyzed for N-15/N-14 and total N content. Our result showed that all three plant species took up glycine-N, but uptake of inorganic N was generally predominant. The graminoid K. pygmaea took up all three N forms equally in June but preferred NO3--N in July (particularly under grazing) and exchangeable NH4+-N in September. The forbs P. bifurca and P. multifida preferentially took up exchangeable NH4+-N in July (particularly under grazing), while NO3--N was the dominant form of N uptake in September. P. bifurca generally preferred exchangeable NH4+-N, but preference shifted toward NO3--N under grazing in June. P. multifida preferred glycine-N in ungrazed plots and shifted its preference to NO3--N under grazing in June. In conclusion, the three plant species showed niche partitioning for uptake of three forms of N across the season, which was modified by grazing. These findings indicate that plant N uptake patterns should be considered for better understanding the mechanisms of grazing effects on plant diversity and species coexistence.","2016",NA,"10.1007/s00374-015-1069-1","WOS:000373441100008"

We explore patterns of spatial overlap between these species to address coexistence and infer possible competition from spatial patterns in the western Mediterranean Sea. A spatially explicit modelling approach revealed that spatial overlap mainly responded to the distribution of shared resources, where coexistence is allowed by different ecological processes. Catshark (k-strategy) was highly abundant and widely distributed. However, the fluctuating population dynamics of octopus (r-strategy) explained the variations in spatial patterns of overlap. Spatial structuring across the study area was observed both in population distributions and in species interactions (coexistence or exclusion). Areas with high resources in terms of specific prey items (Catalan Sea) or alternative supplies, such as niche opportunities and ecosystem functions defined by community diversity (Balearic Islands), favoured species coexistence. Sea surface temperature showed opposite effects on overlap in northern and southern regions of the study area, which were not related to differences in species sensitivity. We suggest a surface trophic link, where different phytoplankton communities at each region might have opposite responses to temperature. This triggers contrasting mechanisms of food transfer to deeper benthic communities that subsequently facilitates species overlap. Characterizing how benthic and pelagic seascape properties shape species interactions across space and time is pivotal to properly address community spatial dynamics and move towards ecosystem-based management for sustainable fisheries and conservation planning.","2016",NA,"10.1093/icesjms/fsw053","WOS:000380140100018"

Feeding activity was linked to season and ovarian condition. The stomach fullness was high during spring and summer and low in fall. Females with advanced ovaries also displayed low stomach fullness, which suggests that feeding activity is affected by the reproductive cycle. The diet of S.melantho consisted of 42 different prey categories, primarily smaller crustaceans, Foraminifera, polychaetes, mollusks and fishes (larvae and eggs). Crustacea,Foraminifera and polychaetes together constituted the dominant prey groups, accounting for 75% of total prey abundance and >50% of total prey occurrence. Diet composition differed among seasons between sexes and size classes. Females and males consumed the same prey items but with different orders of importance. In terms of body size, the small shrimps preferred relatively small food items, such as Foraminifera and algae, whereas larger shrimps preferred polychaetes and crustaceans. Trophic diversity varied among the seasons within both sexes and size classes, with the highest values being observed in fall.

Copepod eggs were highly abundant in the first and last quarter, at the full moon and zoea of Ucides cordatus (Ocypodidae) in the new moon. The Engraulidae larvae fed on microcrustaceans, algae and early planktonic stages of benthic organisms. The relative importance of prey varied according to prey availability in all moon phases. Larval diets were more even in the full and new moons, when the relative importance of calanoid copepods and zoeae of U. cordatus as food items increased (index of relative importance, >80% I-RI). Mangrove creeks were very important feeding grounds for engraulid larvae during spring tides. Larval diets were more diverse in the first and last-quarter moon and included protozoeae of Caridean shrimp, larvae of Anomalocardia brasiliana (Veneridae), Isopoda, Gastropoda, ephippium of Daphnia sp. and nauplii of Cirripedia, Harpacticoidia and cyclopoid Copepoda. The last five items were not found in the creeks, suggesting feeding in the main channel. During neap tides, mangrove creeks were probably also used as refugia. These larvae are opportunistic and feed on highly available prey and both species feed on the same items, leading to high dietary overlap in all moon phases.

The effect of alien pines on AM fungal communities differed between these regions. In South Africa, plantations of alien EcM pines exhibited lower AM fungal richness and significantly altered community composition, compared with native fynbos. In Argentina, the richness and composition of local AM fungal communities were similar in plantations of alien EcM pines and native forest. However, the presence of alien pines resulted in slight changes to the phylogenetic structure of root AM fungal communities in both regions. In pine clearcut areas in South Africa, the richness and composition of AM fungal communities were intermediate between the native fynbos and the alien pine plantation, which is consistent with natural regeneration of former AM fungal communities following pine removal.

Diadema mexicanum and Eucidaris thouarsii are the most important sea urchins on the Ecuadorian coastal reefs. This study provided a trophic scenario for these two species of echinoids in the coral-rocky reef bottoms of the Ecuadorian coast, using stable isotopes. We evaluated the relative proportion of algal resources assimilated, and trophic niche of the two sea urchins in the most southern coral-rocky reefs of the ETP in two sites with different disturbance level. Bayesian models were used to estimate the contribution of algal sources, niche breadth, and trophic overlap between the two species. The sea urchins behaved as opportunistic feeders, although they showed differential resource assimilation. Eucidaris thouarsii is the dominant species in disturbed environments; likewise, their niche amplitude was broader than that of D. mexicanum when conditions were not optimal. However, there was no niche overlap between the species. The Stable Isotope Analysis in R (SIAR) indicated that both sea urchins shared limiting resources in the disturbed area, mainly Dictyota spp. (contributions of up to 85% for D. mexicanum and up to 75% for E. thouarsii). The Stable Isotope Bayesian Ellipses in R (SIBER) analysis results indicated less interspecific competition in the undisturbed site. Our results suggested a trophic niche partitioning between sympatric sea urchin species in coastal areas of the ETP, but the limitation of resources could lead to trophic overlap and stronger habitat degradation.","2016",NA,"10.7717/peerj.1578","WOS:000368410500010"

These two species are closely related and are thought to perform similar ecological functions in the vaginal environment. Temporal data on the vaginal microbiome have shown that nontransient instances of cooccurrence are uncommon, while transitions from an L. iners-dominated community to one dominated by L. crispatus, and vice versa, occur often. This suggests that there is substantial overlap in the fundamental niches of these species. Given this apparent niche overlap, it is unclear how they have been maintained as common inhabitants of the human vagina. In this study, we characterized and compared the genomes of L. iners and L. crispatus to gain insight into possible mechanisms driving the maintenance of this species diversity. Our results highlight differences in the genomes of these two species that may facilitate the partitioning of their shared niche space. Many of the identified differences may impact the protective benefits provided to the host by these two species. IMPORTANCE The microbial communities that inhabit the human vagina play a critical role in the maintenance of vaginal health through the production of lactic acid and lowering the environmental pH. This precludes the growth of nonindigenous organisms and protects against infectious disease. The two most common types of vaginal communities are dominated by either Lactobacillus iners or Lactobacillus crispatus, while some communities alternate between the two over time. We combined ecological theory with state-of-the-art genome analyses to characterize how these two species might partition their shared niche space in the vagina. We show that the genomes of L. iners and L. crispatus differ in many respects, several of which may drive differences in their competitive abilities in the vagina. Our results provide insight into factors that drive the complicated temporal dynamics of the vaginal microbiome and demonstrate how closely related microbial species partition shared fundamental niche space.","2016",NA,"10.1128/AEM.02385-16","WOS:000388090500006"

Our results consistently showed that the conspecific leaf litter of three species negatively affected the seedling survival. Meanwhile, the traditional conspecific adult neighborhood indices failed to detect this negative conspecific adult effect.

They display different levels of territoriality and farming behavior, from almost non territorial to monoculture farmers. In addition, a few species inhabit seagrass meadows but, presently, none can be considered as seagrass-eating specialists. The footballer demoiselle. Chrysiptera annulata, is found in the scagrass meadows on the reef flat of the Great Reef of Toliara (Madagascar, Mozambique Channel). In the light of this unusual habitat for a pomacentrid, this study aimed to answer three questions: 1) What is the diet of C. annulata? 2) Do the resources supporting this diet include seagrass? 3) Does its trophic niche overlap those of other sympatric damselfishes (Pomacentrus trilineatus, Chrysiptera unimaculata and Plectroglyphidodon ktcrymatus) living in close association with macrophytes or eating algae? Stomach content examination and stable isotope analysis showed that the footballer demoiselle is not a seagrass consumer but is an omnivorous/herbivorous species heavily relying on algal resources and small invertebrates. SIAR, a stable isotope mixing model, indicated it assimilated large amounts of turf algae, and various benthic or planktonic invertebrates in lower proportions. SIBER metrics revealed that the isotopic niche of the footballer demoiselle partly overlaps that of its congener, C. unimaculata, but not those of P. trilineatus and P. lacrymatus. Trophic strategies of C. annulata differed both from farming species such as P. lacrymatus and from less territorial herbivores such as P trilineatus. Its seagrass meadow habitat on the Great Reef of Toliara allows the conquest of an unusual habitat for damselfishes and could limit competition with C. unimaculata, a species displaying the same territorial behavior and the same isotopic niche but living on the reef itself.","2016",NA,NA,"WOS:000374569300003"

Stomach content analyses of samples collected between February 2011 and January 2012 revealed that detritus and algae were prominent food items in their diets, with low dietary contributions of animal material.

The calculation of trophic niche size from the stomach content data revealed that the niche of G.ghorensis (0.10) was generally smaller than sympatric C.damascina (0.24), with an overlap of 72%, whereas they had a larger trophic niche than sympatric O.aureus (0.20-0.13), with a niche overlap of 54%. These outputs were generally supported by stable isotope analyses of C-13 and N-15 completed on samples collected at the end of the 2011 growth season, although these indicated a greater contribution of animal material to assimilated diet.

We used a novel metagenetic approach to investigate variation in nematode community structure in the Fynbos vegetation of South Africa. We compared 23 samples of soil nematode communities from five different Fynbos landscapes. Nematode DNA was 454-pyrosequenced for the 18S rRNA gene. We investigated the community structure, diversity, and the relative role of both deterministic (niche-based) and neutral processes may play in delimiting the nematode phylogenetic community structure in different Fynbos vegetation types. Nematode diversity showed no relationship to any measured soil parameter. The phylogenetic signal showed that more closely related types of nematodes in the Fynbos tended to co-occur more often than would be expected by chance, demonstrating that (a) closely related lineages occupy similar niches spatially and (b) community variation is influenced more by determinism than stochasticity. The standardised beta mean nearest taxon distance (ses.beta MNTD) index showed no association with vegetation type. Both ses.NTI (nearest taxon index) and ses.beta MNTD deviated significantly from null models, indicating that deterministic processes were important in the assembly of nematode communities. Furthermore, at local scale, the ses.NTI was significantly higher than null expectations, indicating that co-occurrence of related nematode lineages is determined by the differences in environmental conditions across the sites. We conclude that in the Fynbos there is niche overlap between closely related types of nematodes, that nematode speciation tends to occur conservatively into closely related niches, and that the phylogenetic community structure reveals that deterministic (rather than stochastic) processes are more important in delimiting the community assembly.","2016",NA,"10.1007/s10682-016-9837-4","WOS:000379520200007"

A leading hypothesis to explain tree coexistence is the Janzen-Connell model, which proposes an accumulation of host-specific enemies, e.g., soil organisms. While it has been shown in several non-savanna case studies that seedlings dispersed away from the mother perform better than seedlings that stay close (home-away effect), few studies tested whether foreign seedling species can replace own seedlings under conspecific adults (replacement effect). Some studies additionally tested for negative effects of conspecific biota (conspecific effect) to demonstrate the accumulation of enemies. We tested these effects by reciprocally growing seedlings of four tree species on soil collected beneath adults of all species, with and without applying a soil sterilization treatment. We found negative home-away effects suggesting that dispersal is advantageous and negative replacement effects suggesting species replacement under adults. While negative conspecific effects indicate accumulated enemies, positive heterospecific effects indicate an accumulation of mutualists rather than enemies for some species. We suggest that plant-soil feedbacks may well contribute to tree coexistence in savannas due to both negative conspecific and positive heterospecific feedbacks.","2016",NA,"10.1890/15-1316.1","WOS:000371439800003"

The genus Campylobacter belongs to Class epsilon-proteobacteria under the Phylum Proteobacteria. It represents economically important species which are gastrointestinal pathogens in humans and livestock animals. Currently, more than 400 16S rDNA sequences belonging to 28 species of this genus are present in the RDP database. But heterogeneity has led to the misplacement of many of these sequences within wrong species. Also, various sequences belonging to Campylobacter have been deposited as orphans. The current study aimed to explore the internal features of 16S rRNA gene sequences in order to develop methods for identification of Campylobacter up to species level. Methods: 428 16S rRNA sequences of 28 species of Campylobacter were analyzed. 392 sequences (> 1200 nucleotides, nts) of 16 species were considered for (i) phylogenetic framework analysis and (ii) in silico restriction digestion. 28 uncharacterized sequences present in the database were also investigated in the present study. Results: Phylogenetic framework analysis allowed the identification of genetic variability within Campylobacter species and helped to segregate certain uncharacterized sequences up to species level. 12 out of the 16 species under study showed homogenous behavior, but heterogeneity was observed between C. jejuni and C. coli and C. helveticus and C. upsaliensis respectively. Unique restriction enzymes were identified for six species. Conclusions: The present approach clearly showed that internal features of 16S rRNA is a useful tool for characterization of novel isolates up to the species level. Studies have revealed that niche overlap and consequent increase in the horizontal gene transfer between C. coli and C. jejuni, due to anthropogenic factors, maybe the reason for their heterogeneous nature. This explains the difficulties faced in segregation of the members of these species. 16S rRNA gene proved to be a viable and excellent marker for characterizing the uncharacterized Campylobacter strains leading to a significant diminution in database redundancy. Further, the approaches used in the study might assist in easier identification of the various Campylobacter sequences present in the database.","2016",NA,"10.3103/S0891416816030071","WOS:000393113600010"

Viewing facilitation through the lens of the niche concept is one way to unify conceptual and empirical advances about the role of facilitation in community ecology. 2. We clarify conceptually and through examples from marine and terrestrial environments how facilitation can expand species' niches and consider how these interactions can be scaled up to understand the importance of facilitation in setting a species' geographic range. We then integrate the niche-broadening influence of facilitation into current conceptual areas in ecology, including climate change, diversity maintenance and the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning. 3. Because facilitation can influence the range of physical conditions under which a species can persist, it has the potential to mitigate the effects of climate change on species distributions. Whereas facilitation has mostly been considered as a diversity-promoting interaction by ameliorating abiotic stresses, if facilitated species' niches expand and become less distinct as a result of habitat amelioration, the forces that maintain diversity and promote coexistence in regions or habitats dominated by the facilitator could be reduced (i.e. the sign of the effects of facilitation on populations could be species-specific). Finally, shifting or broadening ecological niches could alter the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning. 4. A niche-based perspective on the effects of facilitation can foster a greater mechanistic understanding of the role played by facilitation in regulating species coexistence, range shifts and ecosystem functioning in a changing world.","2016",NA,"10.1111/1365-2435.12528","WOS:000367855900008"

As much as 100 different EM fungal species can coexist and interact with the same tree species, forming complex multispecies networks in soils. The degree of host specificity and structural properties of these interaction networks (e.g., nestedness and modularity) may influence plant and fungal community assembly and species coexistence, yet their structure has been little studied in northern coniferous forests, where trees depend on EM fungi for nutrient acquisition. We used high-throughput sequencing to characterize the composition and diversity of bulk soil and root-associated fungal communities in four co-occurring Pinaceae in a relic foredune plain located at Iles de la Madeleine, Quebec, Canada. We found high EM fungal richness across the four hosts, with a total of 200 EM operational taxonomic units (OTUs), mainly belonging to the Agaricomycetes. Network analysis revealed an antinested pattern in both bulk soil and roots EM fungal communities. However, there was no detectable modularity (i.e., subgroups of interacting species) in the interaction networks, indicating a low level of specificity in these EM associations. In addition, there were no differences in EM fungal OTU richness or community structure among the four tree species. Limited shared resources and competitive exclusion typically restrict the number of taxa coexisting within the same niche. As such, our finding of high EM fungal richness and low host specificity highlights the need for further studies to determine the mechanisms enabling such a large number of EM fungal species to coexist locally on the same hosts.","2016",NA,"10.1002/ece3.1881","WOS:000369164000029"

Theoretical and empirical ecology has transitioned from a focus on the role of negative interactions in species coexistence to a more pluralistic view that acknowledges that coexistence in natural communities is more complex, and depends on species interactions that vary in strength, sign, and reciprocity, and such contexts as the environment and life-history stage. 2. We used a whole-community approach to examine how species interactions contribute to the maintenance of a rocky intertidal macroalgal canopy-understorey assemblage. We determined both the types of interactions in this network, and whether interactions were sensitive to environmental gradients. 3. Focusing on a structurally dominant canopy kelp Saccharina sessilis, and its diverse co-occurring understorey assemblage, we evaluated the role of the understorey in controlling S. sessilis recruitment and quantified the reciprocal effect of the S. sessilis canopy and understorey on one another using a removal experiment replicated across 600 km of coastline. We determined the sensitivity of interactions to natural variation in light and nutrient availability (replicated among four regions on the N.E. Pacific coast), and under different wave conditions (three wave regimes). 4. Surprisingly, species interactions were similar across sites and thus not context-dependent. Unexpectedly, the understorey community had a strong positive effect on the S. sessilis canopy, whereby the adult canopy decreased dramatically following understorey removal. Additionally, S. sessilis recruitment depended on the presence of understorey coralline algal turf. In turn, the canopy had a neutral effect on the coralline understorey, but a negative effect on non-calcifying algal turfs, likely eventually generating positive indirect canopy effects on the coralline understorey. Density-dependent intraspecific competition between S. sessilis adults and recruits may moderate this positive feedback between the S. sessilis canopy and coralline understorey. 5. Synthesis. Our research highlights the importance of positive interactions for coexistence in natural communities, and the necessity of studying multiple life-history stages and reciprocal species interactions in order to elucidate the mechanisms that maintain diversity.","2016",NA,"10.1111/1365-2745.12495","WOS:000368298700005"

Herein we present and discuss a novel mechanism based on our investigation of NDD predictions for the large, grove-forming ectomycorrhizal mast fruiting tree, Microberlinia bisulcata (Caesalpiniaceae), in an 82.5-ha plot at Korup, Cameroon. We tested whether juvenile density, size, growth and survival decreases with increasing conspecific adult basal area for 3245 'new' seedlings and 540 'old' seedlings (< 75-cm tall) during an approximately 4-year study period (2008-2012) and for 234 'saplings' (a parts per thousand yen 75-cm tall) during an approximately 6-year study period (2008-2014). We found that the respective densities of new seedlings, old seedlings and saplings were positively, not and negatively related to increasing BA. Maximum leaf numbers and heights of old seedlings were negatively correlated with increasing basal areas, as were sapling heights and stem diameters. Whereas survivorship of new seedlings decreased by more than one-half with increasing basal area over its range in 2010-2012, that of old seedlings decreased by almost two-thirds, but only in 2008-2010, and was generally unrelated to conspecific seedling density. In 2010-2012 relative growth rates in new seedlings' heights decreased with increasing basal area, as well as with increasing seedling density, together with increasing leaf numbers, whereas old seedlings' growth was unrelated to either conspecific density or basal area. Saplings of below-average height had reduced survivorship with increasing basal area (probability decreasing from approx. 0.4 to 0.05 over the basal area range tested), but only sapling growth in terms of leaf numbers decreased with increasing basal area. These static and dynamic results indicate that NDD is operating within this system, possibly stabilizing the M. bisulcata population. However, these NDD patterns are unlikely to be caused by symmetric competition or by consumers. Instead, an alternative mechanism for conspecific adult-juvenile negative feedback is proposed, one which involves the interaction between tree phenology and ectomycorrhizal linkages.","2016",NA,"10.1007/s00442-015-3534-9","WOS:000374564000019"

Adaptive radiation constitutes an important evolutionary process that generates biodiversity. Competition has long been thought to influence adaptive radiation, but the directionality of its effect and associated mechanisms remain ambiguous. Here, we report a rigorous experimental test of the role of competition on adaptive radiation using the rapidly evolving bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 interacting with multiple bacterial species that differed in their phylogenetic distance to the diversifying bacterium. We showed that the inhibitive effect of competitors on the adaptive radiation of P. fluorescens decreased as their phylogenetic distance increased. To explain this phylogenetic dependency of adaptive radiation, we linked the phylogenetic distance between P. fluorescens and its competitors to their niche and competitive fitness differences. Competitive fitness differences, which showed weak phylogenetic signal, reduced P. fluorescens abundance and thus diversification, whereas phylogenetically conserved niche differences promoted diversification. These results demonstrate the context dependency of competitive effects on adaptive radiation, and highlight the importance of past evolutionary history for ongoing evolutionary processes.","2016",NA,"10.1098/rspb.2016.0241","WOS:000381247300018"
"Zhao, L; Zhang, QG; Zhang, DY","Evolution alters ecological mechanisms of coexistence in experimental microcosms","FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY","Species coexistence can be promoted by both equalizing mechanisms that increase fitness equivalence among species and stabilizing mechanisms that decrease niche overlap among species. Strength of the coexistence mechanisms can be altered by evolution. In particular, populations evolved in sympatry may show niche divergence due to competition-mediated selection, whereas populations evolved in allopatry have a chance to become ecologically equivalent competitors which, on secondary contacts, may form neutral communities'. We addressed how evolution may change ecological mechanisms of coexistence with experimental microcosms of Escherichia coli strains that reproduce asexually and can be considered as analogues of species. We obtained five pairs of bacterial strains, within each of which the two strains could coexist stably. We then allowed the bacterial strains to evolve in a chemically defined nutrient medium for 1100 generations, under sympatric (in two-strain mixtures) or allopatric scenarios (in monocultures). The strength of coexistence mechanisms was assessed based on reciprocal invasion assays and measurements of environmental carrying capacity. Our data confirmed that coexistence could be weaken by either fitness difference or niche overlap among competitors. In allopatrically evolved strain pairs, fitness difference among competitors became larger or unchanged; and the magnitude of niche overlap often showed an increase rather than a decline. Sympatrically evolved competitors showed no consistent changing trend in the strength of the coexistence mechanisms. Overall, sympatrically evolved competitor pairs did not differ from allopatrically evolved ones in the magnitude of fitness difference, but had lower levels of niche overlap. The results are consistent with the character displacement' view that allopatric populations of competing species occupy more similar niche space compared with sympatric populations. However, the pattern observed here resulted from allopatrically evolved competitors showing niche convergence, but not sympatrically evolved competitors consistently showing further niche divergence. The results also suggest that convergent evolution in allopatry followed by secondary contacts is an unlikely mechanism for the origin of neutral communities'.","2016",NA,"10.1111/1365-2435.12611","WOS:000382581400017"

It was shown long ago, though in cell cultures, that most of these genotypes had lower fitness than the population they belong, an observation that explained why single-virion passages turned on Muller's ratchet while very large population passages resulted in fitness increases in novel environments. Here we report the results of an experiment specifically designed to evaluate in vivo the fitness differences among the subclonal components of a clonal population of the plant RNA virus tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV). Over 100 individual biological subclones from a TEV clonal population well adapted to the natural tobacco host were obtained by infectivity assays on a local lesion host. The replicative fitness of these subclones was then evaluated during infection of tobacco relative to the fitness of large random samples taken from the starting clonal population. Fitness was evaluated at increasing number of days post-inoculation. We found that at early days, the average fitness of subclones was significantly lower than the fitness of the clonal population, thus confirming previous observations that most subclones contained deleterious mutations. However, as the number of days of viral replication increases, population size expands exponentially, more beneficial and compensatory mutations are produced, and selection becomes more effective in optimizing fitness, the differences between subclones and the population disappeared.","2016",NA,"10.1093/ve/vew006","WOS:000399949900010"

However, how both types of processes are mediated by anthropogenic environmental changes has rarely been explored. Here we report a novel and general pattern that almost all anthropogenic environmental changes that took place in a grassland ecosystem affected soil bacterial community assembly primarily through promoting or restraining stochastic processes. We performed four experiments mimicking 16 types of environmental changes and separated the compositional variation of soil bacterial communities caused by each environmental change into deterministic and stochastic components, with a recently developed method. Briefly, because the difference between control and treatment communities is primarily caused by deterministic processes, the deterministic change was quantified as (mean compositional variation between treatment and control) - (mean compositional variation within control). The difference among replicate treatment communities is primarily caused by stochastic processes, so the stochastic change was estimated as (mean compositional variation within treatment) - (mean compositional variation within control). The absolute of the stochastic change was greater than that of the deterministic change across almost all environmental changes, which was robust for both taxonomic and functional-based criterion. Although the deterministic change may become more important as environmental changes last longer, our findings showed that changes usually occurred through mediating stochastic processes over 5years, challenging the traditional determinism-dominated view.","2016",NA,"10.1111/gcb.13080","WOS:000367982900015"

It is known that on uncorrelated fitness landscapes, this distribution can only be of three types: truncated, exponential and power law. We performed extensive stochastic simulations to study the adaptation dynamics on rugged fitness landscapes, and identified two quantities that can be used to distinguish the underlying distribution of beneficial fitness effects. The first quantity studied here is the fitness difference between successive mutations that spread in the population, which is found to decrease in the case of truncated distributions, remains nearly a constant for exponentially decaying distributions and increases when the fitness distribution decays as a power law. The second quantity of interest, namely, the rate of change of fitness with time also shows quantitatively different behaviour for different beneficial fitness distributions. The patterns displayed by the two aforementioned quantities are found to hold good for both low and high mutation rates.

This, in turn, might reduce bacterial phylogenetic diversity by favouring one (or a few) competitive bacterial clade. We collected topsoils in 15 semi-arid plant patches and adjacent low-cover areas configuring a plant phylodiversity gradient, pyrosequenced the 16S rRNA gene to identify bacterial taxa and analysed soil fertility parameters. Structural equation modelling showed positive effects of both plant richness and phylogenetic diversity on soil fertility. Fertility increased bacterial richness but reduced bacterial phylogenetic diversity. This might be attributed to the competitive dominance of a lineage based on its high relative fitness.

To this end, we grew replicate lines of yeast for 500 generations in the presence of (1) a constant high concentration of cadmium, nickel, or zinc or (2) a gradually increasing concentration of these metals. We found that gradual environmental change leads to a delay in fitness increase compared with abrupt change but not necessarily to a different fitness of evolutionary endpoints. For the nonessential metal cadmium, this delay is due to reduced fitness differences between genotypes at low metal concentrations, consistent with directional selection to minimize intracellular concentrations of this metal. In contrast, for the essential metals nickel and zinc, different genotypes are selected at different concentrations, consistent with stabilizing selection to maintain constant intracellular concentrations of these metals. These findings indicate diverse fitness consequences of evolved tolerance mechanisms for essential and nonessential metals and imply that the rate of environmental change and the nature of the stressor are crucial determinants of evolutionary dynamics.","2016",NA,"10.1086/684104","WOS:000368559300003"

Although cell-surface binding primarily limits virus infection success, generalized adaptation to counteract innate immunity across disparate hosts may contribute to RNA virus emergence potential. We examined this idea using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) populations previously evolved on strictly immune-deficient (HeLa) cells, strictly immune competent (MDCK) cells, or on alternating deficient/competent cells. By measuring viral fitness in unselected human cancer cells of differing innate immunity, we confirmed that HeLa-adapted populations were specialized for innate immune-deficient hosts, whereas MDCK-adapted populations were relatively more generalized for fitness on hosts of differing innate immune capacity and of different species origin. We also confirmed that HeLa-evolved populations maintained fitness in immune-deficient nonhuman primate cells. These results suggest that innate immunity is more prominent than host species in determining viral fitness at the host-cell level. Finally, our prediction was inexact that selection on alternating deficient/competent hosts should produce innate viral generalists. Rather, fitness differences among alternating host-evolved VSV populations indicated variable capacities to evade innate immunity.

We sampled eight hydroelectric reservoirs over a large scale (1500 km) in central Brazil, during three climatological periods. Phytoplankton composition was correlated with niche differentiation; that is, environmental similarity would account for assemblage similarity, due to the high dispersal abilities and low turnover rates of these organisms. For zooplankton, geographical distances were more important, which resulted in a stronger spatial structure with a greater dispersal limitation. For phytoplankton, the Morphologically Based Functional Group formed by diatoms, and for zooplankton, the three major taxonomic groups appeared as spatially structured.

Nonetheless, the degree to which bacterial communities are benign, harmful, or beneficial to plants in situ is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that the net effect of reducing bacterial abundance and diversity would vary substantially among host species (from harmful to beneficial) and this would be strongly mediated by soil resource availability. To test this, we monitored tree seedling growth responses to commercial antibiotics among replicated resource supply treatments (N,P,K) in a tropical forest in Panama for 29months. We applied either antibiotics or control water to replicated seedlings of five common tree species (Alseis blackiana, Desmopsis panamensis, Heisteria concinna, Sorocea affinis, and Tetragastris panamensis). These antibiotic treatments significantly reduced both the abundance and diversity of bacteria epiphytically as well as endophytically. Overall, the effect of antibiotics on performance was highly host specific. Applying antibiotics increased growth for three species by as much as 49% (Alseis, Heisteria, and Tetragastris), decreased growth for a fourth species by nearly 20% (Sorocea), and had no impact on a fifth species (Desmopsis). Perhaps more importantly, the degree to which foliar bacteria were harmful or not varied with soil resource supply. Specifically, applying antibiotics had no effect when potassium was added but increased growth rate by almost 40% in the absence of potassium. Alternatively, phosphorus enrichment caused the effect of bacteria to switch from being primarily beneficial to harmful or vice versa, but this depended entirely on the presence or absence of nitrogen enrichment (i.e., important and significant interactions). Our results are the first to demonstrate that the net effect of reducing the abundance and diversity of bacteria can have very strong positive and negative effects on seedling performance. Moreover, these effects were clearly mediated by soil resource availability. Though speculative, we suggest that foliar bacteria may interact with soil fertility to comprise an important, yet cryptic dimension of niche differentiation, which can have important implications for species coexistence.","2016",NA,"10.1002/ecy.1537","WOS:000387228200011"

A positive correlation between numerically dominant AOA and Nitrospira, and their co-occurrence at the same spatial scale in August and October, suggests that the nitrification process is predominantly performed by these groups and is restricted to a limited timeframe. Amongst nitrite-oxidizers, niche differentiation was evident in observed seasonally varying patterns of co-occurrence and spatial separation. While their distributions were most likely driven by substrate concentrations, oxygen availability may also have played a role under substrate-limited conditions.

Short-term N-15 experiments with NH4+, NO3-, and glycine were conducted in July, August and September in a temperate grassland to evaluate the chemical, spatial and temporal niche differentiation by competition between plants and microorganisms for N. Microorganisms preferred NH4+ and NO3-, while plants preferred NO3-. Both plants and microorganisms acquired more N in August and September than in July. The soil depth had no significant effects on microbial uptake, but significantly affected plant N uptake. Plants acquired 67% of their N from the 0-5 cm soil layer and 33% from the 5-15 cm layer. The amount of N taken up by microorganisms was at least seven times than plants. Although microorganisms efficiently compete for N with plants, the competition is alleviated through chemical partitioning mainly in deeper soil layer. In the upper soil layer, neither chemical nor temporal niche separation is realized leading to strong competition between plants and microorganisms that modifies N dynamics in grasslands.","2016",NA,"10.1038/srep22642","WOS:000371683200001"

Here, we report the cultivation and characterization of two novel Nitrosopumilus strains, originating from coastal surface waters of the Northern Adriatic Sea. The combined physiological and genomic information revealed that each strain exhibits different metabolic and functional traits, potentially reflecting contrasting life modes. Strain NF5 contains many chemotaxis-related genes and is able to express archaella, suggesting that it can sense and actively seek favorable microenvironments such as nutrient-rich particles. In contrast, strain D3C is non-motile and shows higher versatility in substrate utilization, being able to use urea as an alternative substrate in addition to ammonia. Furthermore, it encodes a divergent, second copy of the AmoB subunit of the key enzyme ammonia monooxygenase, which might have an additional catalytic function and suggests further metabolic versatility. However, the role of this gene requires further investigation. Our results provide evidence for functional diversity and metabolic versatility among phylogenetically closely related thaumarchaeal strains, and point toward adaptations to free-living versus particle-associated life styles and possible niche differentiation among AOA in marine ecosystems.","2016",NA,"10.1038/ismej.2015.200","WOS:000374377200004"

This interaction between niche differences and environmental variability may also help explain relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, but few data are available to rigorously evaluate this hypothesis. We assessed how a biologically relevant aspect of environmental heterogeneity interacts with species diversity to determine ecosystem processes in a natural rocky intertidal community. We used field removals to factorially manipulate biogenic habitat heterogeneity (barnacles, bare rock, and plots that were 50/50 mixes of the two habitat types) and gastropod grazer species richness and then tracked algal community succession and recovery over the course of 1 yr. We found that herbivore diversity, substrate heterogeneity, and their interaction played unique roles in the peak abundance and timing of occurrence of different algal functional groups. Early successional microalgae were most heavily grazed in diverse herbivore assemblages and those with barnacles present, which was likely due to complementary feeding strategies among all three grazers. In contrast, late successional macroalgae were strongly influenced by the presence of a habitat generalist limpet. In this herbivore's absence, heterogeneous habitats (i.e., mixtures of bare rock and barnacles) experienced the greatest algal accumulation, which was partly a result of complementary habitat use by the remaining herbivores. The complex way habitat identity and heterogeneity altered grazer-algal interactions in our study suggests species' differences and environmental heterogeneity both separately and interactively contribute to the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functions.","2016",NA,"10.1890/15-1633.1","WOS:000380749600025"

However, fundamental knowledge about the identities, abundance, diversity, biogeography, and controlling environmental factors of nitrogen fixing communities in open ocean sediments is still elusive. Surprisingly, little is known also about nitrogen-fixing communities in sediments of the more research-accessible marginal seas. Here we report on an investigation of the environmental geochemistry and putative diazotrophic microbiota in the sediments of Bohai Sea, an eutrophic marginal sea of the western Pacific Ocean. Diverse and abundant nifH gene sequences were identified and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were found to be the dominant putative nitrogen-fixing microbes. Community statistical analyses suggested bottom water temperature, bottom water chlorophyll a content (or the covarying turbidity) and sediment porewater Eh (or the covarying pH) as the most significant environmental factors controlling the structure and spatial distribution of the putative diazotrophic communities, while sediment Hg content, sulfide content, and porewater SiO32--Si content were identified as the key environmental factors correlated positively with the nifH gene abundance in Bohai Sea sediments. Comparative analyses between the Bohai Sea and the northern South China Sea (nSCS) identified a significant composition difference of the putative diazotrophic communities in sediments between the shallow water (estuarine and nearshore) and deep-water (offshore and deep-sea) environments, and sediment porewater dissolved oxygen content, water depth and in situ temperature as the key environmental factors tentatively controlling the species composition, community structure, and spatial distribution of the marginal sea sediment nifH-harboring microbiota. This confirms the ecophysiological specialization and niche differentiation between the shallow-water and deep-water sediment diazotrophic communities and suggests that the in situ physical and geochemical conditions play a more important role than geographical contiguity in determining the community similarity of the diazotrophic microbiota in marginal sea sediments.","2016",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2016.01111","WOS:000379966900001"

Ammonia-oxidizing prokaryotes play a crucial role in the nitrogen cycles of many marine environments, including marginal seas. However, few studies have attempted to address the distribution patterns of ammonia-oxidizing prokaryotes in mud deposits of these seas. The horizontal and vertical community composition and abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) were investigated in mud deposits of the South Yellow Sea (SYS) and the East China Sea (ECS) by using amoA clone libraries and quantitative PCR. The diversity of AOB was comparable or higher in the mud zone of SYS and lower in ECS when compared with AOA. Vertically, surface sediments had generally higher diversity of AOA and AOB than middle and bottom layers. Diversity of AOA and AOB showed significant correlation with latitude. Nitrosopumilus and Nitrosospira lineages dominated AOA and AOB communities, respectively. Both AOA and AOB assemblages exhibited greater variations across different sites than those among various depths at one site. The abundance of bacterial amoA was generally higher than that of archaeal amoA, and both of them decreased with depth. Niche differentiation, which was affected by dissolved oxygen, salinity, ammonia, and silicate (SiO32-), was observed between AOA and AOB and among different groups of them. The spatial distribution of AOA and AOB was significantly correlated with delta N-15(TN) and and nitrate and delta C-13, respectively.

Genome reduction has been demonstrated in numerous microorganisms and is interpreted as a means of decreasing material cost during DNA synthesis. However, most of the previous studies have been conducted under pure-culture or endosymbiotic conditions, which greatly restrict horizontal gene transfer between microbial species. In nature, microbes frequently interact with each other and gene exchanges are quite common within the microbiota. The evolutionary trend underlying genome size is still poorly understood. The ocean provides an ideal setting for examining the evolutionary process of microbial genomes under natural conditions. We retrieved bacterial compositional information for marine bacterioplanktonic biota from the Visualization and Analysis of Microbial Population Structures database and compared their average genome size along an ocean depth gradient. The results showed that marine bacterioplanktonic biotas tend to minimize their average genome size in the course of their evolutionary processes and that niche differentiation is probably the major force driving genome size reduction. These findings provide novel insight into the understanding of the evolutionary process underlying microbial genome size and mechanisms for maintaining microbial biodiversity in nature.","2016",NA,"10.15666/aeer/1402_065075","WOS:000375222100005"

Phylogenetic-based biodiversity indices have been claimed to provide more accurate predictions of ecosystem functioning than species diversity alone. This approach assumes that the most relevant traits for ecosystem functioning present a phylogenetic signal. Yet, traits-mediating niche partitioning and resource uptake efficiency in animals can be labile. To assess the relative power of a key trait (body size) and phylogeny to predict zooplankton top-down control on phytoplankton, we manipulated trait and phylogenetic distances independently in microcosms while holding species richness constant. We found that body size provided strong predictions of top-down control. In contrast, phylogeny was a poor predictor of grazing rates. Size related grazing efficiency asymmetry was mechanistically more important than niche differences in mediating ecosystem function in our experimental settings. Our study demonstrates a strong link between a single functional trait, (i.e. body size) in zooplankton and trophic interactions, and urges for a cautionary use of phylogenetic information and taxonomic diversity as substitutes for trait information to predict and understand ecosystem functions.","2016",NA,"10.1098/rspb.2016.0487","WOS:000375965600005"

By operating triplicate anaerobic digesters continuously for two years, we found that microbial community composition shifted over time despite stable process performance. Using an association network analysis to evaluate microbial interactions, we detected a clear successional pattern, which exhibited increasing modularity but decreasing connectivity among microbial populations. Phylogenetic diversity was the most important factor associated with network topology, showing positive correlations with modularity but negative correlations with network complexity, suggesting induced niche differentiation over time. Positive, but not negative, correlation strength was significantly related (p < 0.05) to phylogeny. Furthermore, among populations exhibiting consistent positive correlations across networks, close phylogenetic linkages were evident (e.g. Clostridiales organisms). Clostridiales organisms were also identified as keystone populations in the networks (i.e., they had large effects on other species), suggestive of an important role in maintaining process stability.

"Brown, BL; Downing, AL; Leibold, MA","Compensatory dynamics stabilize aggregate community properties in response to multiple types of perturbations","ECOLOGY","Compensatory dynamics are an important suite of mechanisms that can stabilize community and ecosystem attributes in systems subject to environmental fluctuations. However, few experimental investigations of compensatory dynamics have addressed these mechanisms in systems of real-world complexity, and existing evidence relies heavily on correlative analyses, retrospective examination, and experiments in simple systems. We investigated the potential for compensatory dynamics to stabilize plankton communities in plankton mesocosm systems of real-world complexity. We employed four types of perturbations including two types of nutrient pulses, shading, and acidification. To quantify how communities responded to these perturbations, we used a measure of community-wide synchrony combined with spectral analysis that allowed us to assess timescale-specific community dynamics, for example, whether dynamics were synchronous at some timescales but compensatory at others. The 150-d experiment produced 32-point time series of all zooplankton taxa in the mesocosms. We then used those time series to evaluate total zooplankton biomass as an aggregate property and to evaluate community dynamics. For three of our four perturbation types, total zooplankton biomass was significantly less variable in systems with environmental variation than in constant environments. For the same three perturbation types, community-wide synchrony was much lower in fluctuating environments than in the constant environment, particularly at longer timescales (periods approximate to 60 d). Additionally, there were strong negative correlations between population temporal variances and the level of community-wide synchrony. Taken together, these results strongly imply that compensatory interactions between species stabilized total biomass in response to perturbations. Diversity did not differ significantly across either treatments or perturbation types, thus ruling out several classes of mechanisms driven by changes in diversity. We also used several pieces of secondary evidence to evaluate the particular mechanism behind compensatory responses since a wide variety of mechanisms are hypothesized to produce compensatory dynamics. We concluded that fluctuation dependent endogenous cycles that occur as a consequence of consumer-resource interactions in competitive communities were the most likely explanation for the compensatory dynamics observed in our experiment. As with our previous work, scale-dependent dynamics were also a key to understanding compensatory dynamics in these experimental communities.","2016",NA,"10.1890/15-1951.1","WOS:000380749600014"

DNA from each replicate was analysed using HiSeq2000 Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene.

It is clear that within the context of this experiment, many soil bacteria have distinct niches from one another, in terms of both nutrient concentration, and successional time point since a resource first became available. This fine niche differentiation may in part help to explain the coexistence of a diversity of bacteria in soils.

Continental smokers, defined here to include a broad range of carbonic springs, hot springs, and fumaroles that vent mantle-derived fluids in continental settings, exhibit many of the same processes of heat and mass transfer and ecosystem niche differentiation. Helium isotope (He-3/He-4) analyses indicate that widespread mantle degassing is taking place in the western U.S.A., and that variations in mantle helium values correlate best with low seismic-velocity domains in the mantle and lateral contrasts in mantle velocity rather than crustal parameters such as GPS, proximity to volcanoes, crustal velocity, or composition. Microbial community analyses indicate that these springs can host novel microorganisms. A targeted analysis of four springs in New Mexico yield the first published occurrence of chemolithoautotrophic Zetaproteobacteria in a continental setting.

Both grass species took up relatively more N supplied as ammonium than as alanine or tri-alanine when grown under ambient conditions in monoculture. In contrast, when grown in mixtures, F. ovina took up the three supplied N forms in equal amounts, whereas A. odoratum switched to tri-alanine as the main N form. Under warmed conditions, both species took up the N forms equally, irrespective of competition treatments. We have shown that grass species grown in mixture and under ambient conditions reduce competition by acquiring different N forms. Warming increased the availability of inorganic N in the soil and therefore deregulated the need for differential uptake of N forms.","2016",NA,"10.1007/s11104-016-2856-7","WOS:000381991600009"

There were clear differences regarding the digested spores of different fungi passing through the gut and subsequently in the feces. Abundances of bacterial cells in excrement also corresponded to the fungi offered. The extracts from mites had chitinolytic activity, and the plated bacteria are known to produce exochitinases. The various feeding patterns observed were caused by differences in the cell wall structures of the tested fungi. The study illustrates that mycophagy in saprophagous mites does not consist of a single pattern, but rather that it can be classified into several sub-patterns depending upon the digested fungal species and its parts.

The actual degree of isotopic fractionation, however, remains a black-box in most studies. Hence, mean values for trophic enrichment from other taxa are commonly used to delimitate trophic levels. On the other hand, resource composition as well as consumer physiology both influence fractionation patterns. Especially in soil food webs, high variability of isotopic fractionation has been found for both N-15 and C-13. Here, we investigate effects of diet on trophic enrichment in a no-choice feeding, experiment with the oribatid mite model species Archegozetes longisetosus and a set of fungal, animal, algal and plant resources (seeds and vegetative tissues). We found consistent trophic enrichment for nitrogen irrespective of diet (Delta N-15 = 3.9 parts per thousand), but no reliable fractionation for carbon being negative for fungi (Delta C-13 = 1.8 parts per thousand), neutral for algae, and positive for the remaining plant and animal resources (Delta C-13 = 2.3 parts per thousand). The results suggest that delta N-15 is a reliable marker for delimiting the trophic level of oribatid mites and presumably other soil detritivores, while understanding delta C-13 signals needs a priori knowledge about isotopic fractionation with respect to consumed resources.

Similarity of other growth characteristics of 'Ca.

Two possible factors that cause this are a higher competitive ability of algae and the evolutionarily defined differentiation of niches that results in animals avoiding competition with algae. We attempted to shed light on this duality by initally making the following assumption: if the key determinant for algal dominance on sunlit surfaces is niche differentiation rather than competitive exclusion, then a community already formed by animals must be impervious to algal expansion under any light conditions. This hypothesis was tested in a field experiment that used the early fouling communities developing in the upper water layer in the White Sea, Russia. Fouling communities were allowed to develop on the top sides and bottom sides of horizontal plates. After a period of exposure in water, the plates were inverted. It was shown that if the substrate orientation is reversed, the fouling community is transformed into the community that conforms to the new lighting conditions. An increased light intensity resulted in the degradation of the zoocenosis and changed its structure, whereas shading did not lead to degradation and change in the algocenosis, but caused stunting of algal growth. Our results indicate that algocenoses are more stable and have more competitive ability than zoocenoses in early fouling communities. The animal predominance on the shaded surfaces is likely to be a consequence of both competitive displacement of animals from the sunlit surfaces by algae and preferential colonization of the bottom surfaces by animals.","2016",NA,"10.3354/meps11767","WOS:000383800600002"

The most abundant phyla in both hypolith metagenomes were Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Bacteroidetes with Cyanobacteria dominating in Antarctic hypoliths. However, no significant differences between the two metagenomes were identified. The Antarctic hypolithic metagenome displayed a high number of sequences assigned to sigma factors, replication, recombination and repair, translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis. In contrast, the Namib Desert metagenome showed a high abundance of sequences assigned to carbohydrate transport and metabolism. Metagenome data analysis also revealed significant divergence in the genetic determinants of amino acid and nucleotide metabolism between these two metagenomes and those of soil from other polar deserts, hot deserts, and non-desert soils. Our results suggest extensive niche differentiation in hypolithic microbial communities from these two extreme environments and a high genetic capacity for survival under environmental extremes.","2016",NA,"10.1093/gbe/evw189","WOS:000384307900008"

We examined how land-use disturbance (forestry and agriculture) and naturally harsh environmental conditions (geologically driven acidity) affect the phylogenetic diversity of stream fungi. Using DNA from decomposing alder leaves, we calculated phylogenetic distances among fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Closely related OTUs co-occurred more often than expected by chance, but partitioning the relationship between phylogeny and niche differences showed evidence for niche conservatism only at short phylogenetic distances. Communities in human-disturbed streams were phylogenetically clustered, whereas they were over-dispersed in circumneutral near-pristine streams. OTU richness did not decrease with disturbance; instead, some fungal taxa were replaced by closely related, more tolerant taxa. Fungal communities in naturally acidic reference streams also showed a tendency toward phylogenetic clustering, although much less so than in disturbed streams. Our results indicate different coexistence mechanisms in different environmental settings and a strong role for anthropogenic disturbance as a selective filter shaping the phylogenetic structure of instream fungal communities. The effects of human disturbances on the phylogenetic community structure of fungi occurred independently of taxonomic structure, suggesting utility of phylogenetic approaches to bioassessment.","2016",NA,"10.1002/ecs2.1316","WOS:000374896800040"

By using metagenomic approach, this study investigated the distributions of SRPs and ARGs in marine sediments collected from 12 different coastal locations of Hong Kong, which exhibited different pollution levels and were classified into two groups based on sediment parameters. Our results showed that relative abundances of major SRP genera to total prokaryotes were consistently lower in the more seriously polluted sediments (P-value < 0.05 in 13 of 20 genera), indicating that the relative abundance of SRPs is a negatively correlated biomarker for evaluating human impacts. Moreover, a unimodel distribution pattern for SRPs along with the pollution gradient was observed. Although total ARGs were enriched in sediments from the polluted sites, distribution of single major ARG types could be explained neither by individual sediment parameters nor by corresponding concentration of antibiotics. It supports the hypothesis that the persistence of ARGs in sediments may not need the selection of antibiotics. In summary, our study provided important hints of the niche differentiation of SRPs and behavior of ARGs in marine coastal sediment.Distribution of sulfate-reducing prokaryotes and antibiotic resistance genes in marine sediments with different pollution levels revealed by metagenomic survey.Distribution of sulfate-reducing prokaryotes and antibiotic resistance genes in marine sediments with different pollution levels revealed by metagenomic survey.","2016",NA,"10.1093/femsec/fiw128","WOS:000383898400004"

Here, we assess shifts in cyanobacterial abundances and global gene-expression patterns in response to natural and manipulated gradients in nitrogen and phosphorus to identify gene pathways that facilitate dominance by different cyanobacteria. Gradients in soluble reactive phosphorus shaped cyanobacterial communities and elicited the largest transcriptomic responses. Under high-P conditions (closest to the mouth of the Maumee River), Anabaena and Planktothrix were the dominant cyanobacterial populations, and experimental P and ammonium enrichment promoted nitrogen fixation gene (nifH) expression in Anabaena. For Microcystis, experimental additions of P up-regulated genes involved in phage defense, genomic rearrangement, and nitrogen acquisition but led to lower abundances. Within offshore, low-P regions of the western basin of Lake Erie, Microcystis up-regulated genes associated with P scavenging (pstSCAB, phoX) and dominated cyanobacterial communities. Experimental additions of ammonium and urea did not alter Microcystis abundances but did up-regulate protease inhibitors (aer and mcn gene sets) and microcystin synthetase genes (mcy), with urea enrichment yielding significant increases in microcystin concentrations. Our findings suggest that management plans that reduce P loads alone may not significantly reduce the risk of cyanobacterial blooms in western Lake Erie but rather may promote a shift among cyanobacterial populations (Microcystis, Anabaena, and Planktothrix) toward a greater dominance by toxic strains of Microcystis.","2016",NA,"10.1021/acs.est.5b03931","WOS:000368563400010"

In these forests, deadwood is particularly important for saproxylic and mycorrhizal fungi, sustaining forest productivity and environmental services. In this study, the saproxylic fungal diversity in Mediterranean mountain forests, characterized by different management histories and forest types (holm oak and beech), was analyzed. The relationships between saproxylic fungal biodiversity and structural attributes were considered in three forest stands of the Apennines (Italy). In addition, descriptive environmental parameters and forest traits were related to prevailing fungal communities, in order to analyze the species composition and distribution patterns of saproxylic fungi resulting from the ordination processes. The study sites were selected on the basis of their late-serial stage of development. Species frequency was analyzed through multivariate techniques to test the relationships between fungi, structural attributes and environmental variables. A Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) was used to investigate the response of the overall fungal community structure to environmental gradients. Living tree volume, altitude, vegetation type, and the frequency of species with ephemeral sporocarp lifespan played a crucial role in diversifying species distribution patterns. Deadwood volume and decay classes were related to taxonomic and trophic community diversity. However, differences between the considered climatic regions exerted a major role on the occurrence of fungi with ephemeral sporocarps more than deadwood abundance, utilized primarily as fructification substrate.","2016",NA,"10.3832/ifor1304-008","WOS:000372127500001"

At a regional level, the sustainable management of water resources necessitates an approach that recognises the interconnectivity of multiple water systems within river catchments. This study examined the dynamics in summer diversity of planktonic cyanobacterial communities and microcystin toxin concentrations in two inter-connected lakes from the west of Ireland prone to nutrient enrichment. DGGE analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicons of genotype-I cyanobacteria (typically spherical) showed changes in the communities of both Lough Corrib and Ballyquirke Lough throughout the summer, and identified cyanobacterial genotypes both unique and shared to both lakes. Microcystin concentrations, estimated via the protein phosphatase 2A inhibition assay, were greater in August than in July and June in both lakes. This was concomitant to the increased occurrence of Microcystis as evidenced by DGGE band excision and subsequent sequencing and BLAST analysis. RFLP analysis of PCR amplified mcy-A/E genes clustered together the August samples of both lakes, highlighting a potential change in microcystin producers across the two lakes. Finally, the multiple factor analysis of the combined environmental data set for the two lakes highlighted the expected pattern opposing greater water temperature and chlorophyll concentration against macronutrient concentrations, but also indicated a negative relationship between microcystin concentration and cyanobacterial diversity, possibly underlining allelopathic interactions. Despite some element of connectivity, the dissimilarity in the composition of the cyanobacterial assemblages and the timing of community change in the two lakes likely were a reflexion of niche differences determined by meteorologically-forced variation in physico-chemical parameters in the two water bodies.

Using dilution-to-extinction cultivation techniques, we successfully isolated a novel species of this clade (here designated MBRS-H7) from the ultraoligotrophic open ocean waters of the central Red Sea. Phylogenomic analyses indicate that MBRS-H7 is a novel species that forms a distinct cluster together with isolate KB13 from Hawaii (Hawaii-Red Sea [H-RS] cluster) that is separate from the cluster represented by strain HTCC2181 (from the Oregon coast). Phylogenetic analyses using the robust 16S-23S internal transcribed spacer revealed a potential ecotype separation of the marine OM43 clade members, which was further confirmed by metagenomic fragment recruitment analyses that showed trends of higher abundance in low-chlorophyll and/or high-temperature provinces for the H-RS cluster but a preference for colder, highly productive waters for the HTCC2181 cluster. This potential environmentally driven niche differentiation is also reflected in the metabolic gene inventories, which in the case of the H-RS cluster include those conferring resistance to high levels of UV irradiation, temperature, and salinity. Interestingly, we also found different energy conservation modules between these OM43 subclades, namely, the existence of the NADH: quinone oxidoreductase complex I (NUO) system in the H-RS cluster and the nonhomologous NADH: quinone oxidoreductase (NQR) system in the HTCC2181 cluster, which might have implications for their overall energetic yields.","2016",NA,"10.1128/AEM.02852-15","WOS:000369375900024"

Among viruses it has a dual role. For genomes with higher fitness, it maintains genome integrity in the face of high mutation rates. Conversely, for genomes with lower fitness, it provides immediate access to sequence space that cannot be reached by mutation alone. Understanding how recombination impacts the cohesion and dissolution of individual whole genomes within viral sequence space is poorly understood across double-stranded DNA bacteriophages (a.k.a phages) due to the challenges of obtaining appropriately scaled genomic datasets. Results: Here we explore the role of recombination in both maintaining and differentiating whole genomes of 142 wild double-stranded DNA marine cyanophages. Phylogenomic analysis across the 51 core genes revealed ten lineages, six of which were well represented. These phylogenomic lineages represent discrete genotypic populations based on comparisons of intra-and inter-lineage shared gene content, genome-wide average nucleotide identity, as well as detected gaps in the distribution of pairwise differences between genomes. McDonald-Kreitman selection tests identified putative niche-differentiating genes under positive selection that differed across the six well-represented genotypic populations and that may have driven initial divergence. Concurrent with patterns of recombination of discrete populations, recombination analyses of both genic and intergenic regions largely revealed decreased genetic exchange across individual genomes between relative to within populations. Conclusions: These findings suggest that discrete double-stranded DNA marine cyanophage populations occur in nature and are maintained by patterns of recombination akin to those observed in bacteria, archaea and in sexual eukaryotes.","2016",NA,"10.1186/s12864-016-3286-x","WOS:000388133900008"

We studied arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi (Glomeromycota) in long-term grazed and ungrazed plots at eight sites forming natural gradients of soil properties and rainfall in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. Four metrics of AM fungal abundance and diversity were examined: (1) abundance and species composition of spores, (2) standing crop of AM hyphae in the soil, (3) production of new AM hyphae in buried mesh bags and (4) a bioassay of AM fungal inoculum potential. Our first goal was to test the predictions of the Functional Equilibrium Model that AM fungi should be most abundant in grazed plots (because of increased nutrient demands caused by overcompensation) and at sites with the lowest soil phosphorus (P) and rainfall. Our second goal was to use multi-group structural equation models (SEMs) to investigate the interrelated influences of grazing, soil properties, rainfall and root biomass on the abundance and species composition of AM fungal communities. Two multi-group SEMs were generated: one to examine abundance patterns of AM fungi and another to examine patterns in the spores or auxiliary cells of different families of AM fungi. We observed an extremely high abundance and diversity of AM fungal spores. Only one prediction of the Functional Equilibrium Model was supported; production of new hyphae was highest in the lowest P soils. The abundance and species composition of AM fungi varied across sites but the only variable that responded to grazing was the abundance of Glomeraceae spores, with higher abundance in fenced (ungrazed) plots. Multi-group SEMs revealed that rainfall, total soil P, soil organic matter and soil texture were all important predictors, but the relative importance of each factor varied depending upon the AM metric or taxon observed. Our findings suggest niche differentiation among AM fungal taxa and demonstrate that climate and soil properties are important predictors of the abundance and community composition of these important, hidden components in the Serengeti ecosystem.

Managed bee colonies are of considerable economic interest and it is therefore important to elucidate the diversity and role of this microbiota in the honeybee. In this study, we have sequenced the genomes of eleven strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from the honey crop of the honeybee Apis mellifera. Results: Single gene phylogenies confirmed that the isolated strains represent the diversity of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in the gut, as previously identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Core genome phylogenies of the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria further indicated extensive divergence between strains classified as the same phylotype. Phylotype-specific protein families included unique surface proteins. Within phylotypes, we found a remarkably high level of gene content diversity. Carbohydrate metabolism and transport functions contributed up to 45% of the accessory genes, with some genomes having a higher content of genes encoding phosphotransferase systems for the uptake of carbohydrates than any previously sequenced genome. These genes were often located in highly variable genomic segments that also contained genes for enzymes involved in the degradation and modification of sugar residues. Strain-specific gene clusters for the biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides were identified in two phylotypes. The dynamics of these segments contrasted with low recombination frequencies and conserved gene order structures for the core genes. Hits for CRISPR spacers were almost exclusively found within phylotypes, suggesting that the phylotypes are associated with distinct phage populations. Conclusions: The honeybee gut microbiota has been described as consisting of a modest number of phylotypes; however, the genomes sequenced in the current study demonstrated a very high level of gene content diversity within all three described phylotypes of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, particularly in terms of metabolic functions and surface structures, where many features were strain-specific. Together, these results indicate niche differentiation within phylotypes, suggesting that the honeybee gut microbiota is more complex than previously thought.","2015",NA,"10.1186/s12864-015-1476-6","WOS:000355302300001"

Given these intimate and important interactions, environmental changes have the potential to negatively impact macroalgae by disrupting seaweed microbe interactions. We used the disappearance of the dominant canopy-forming fucoid Phyllospora cornosa from the metropolitan coast of Sydney, NSW, Australia as a model system to study these interactions. We transplanted Phyllospora individuals from nearby, extant populations back onto reefs in Sydney to test whether bacterial assemblages associated with seaweed surfaces would be influenced by (i) the host itself, independently of where it occurs, (ii) the type of habitat where the host occurs, or (iii) site-specific differences. Analyses of bacterial DNA fingerprints (terminal fragment length polymorphisms) indicated that assemblages of bacteria on Phyllospora were not habitat specific. Rather, they were primarily influenced by local, site specific conditions with some evidence for host-specificity in some cases. This could suggest a lottery model of host-surface colonization, by which hosts are colonized by 'suitable' bacteria available in the local species pool, resulting in high variability in assemblage structure across sites, but where some species in the community are specific to the host and possibly influenced by differences in host traits.","2015",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2015.00230","WOS:000352532900001"

We measured the isotopic composition of slime molds (Myxogastria, Amoebozoa), a group of soil protozoans forming macroscopic spore-bearing fruiting bodies. An analysis of largely bacterivorous slime molds can provide information on the bulk stable isotope composition of soil bacteria. METHODS: Fruiting bodies of slime molds were collected in a monsoon tropical forest of Cat Tien National Park, Vietnam, and analyzed by continuous-flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Prior to stable isotope analysis, carbonates were removed from a subset of samples by acidification. To estimate the trophic position of slime molds, their delta C-13 and delta N-15 values were compared with those of plant debris, soil, microbial destructors (litter-decomposing, humus-decomposing, and ectomycorrhizal fungi) and members of higher trophic levels (oribatid mites, termites, predatory macroinvertebrates). RESULTS: Eight species of slime molds represented by at least three independent samples were 3-6% enriched in C-13 and N-15 relative to plant litter. A small but significant difference in the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values suggests that different species of myxomycetes can differ in feeding behavior. The slime molds were enriched in N-15 compared with litter-decomposing fungi, and depleted in N-15 compared with mycorrhizal or humus-decomposing fungi. Slime mold sporocarps and plasmodia largely overlapped with oribatid mites in the isotopic bi-plot, but were depleted in N-15 compared with predatory invertebrates and humiphagous termites. CONCLUSIONS: A comparison with reference groups of soil organisms suggests strong trophic links of slime molds to saprotrophic microorganisms which decompose plant litter, but not to humus-decomposing microorganisms or to mycorrhizal fungi. Under the assumption that slime molds are primarily feeding on bacteria, the isotopic similarity of slime molds and mycophagous soil animals indicates that saprotrophic soil bacteria and fungi are similar in bulk isotopic composition.

Here, using well-established molecular fingerprinting techniques and biochemical assays, we tried to analyze changes in nitrifier abundance, composition and activity in the rhizo sphere under simultaneously elevated atmospheric CO2 and temperature conditions in a Chinese paddy field. Abundance, rather than community composition of ammonia oxidizing archaea and bacteria (AOA and AOB) responded to the climate change treatments, and the effect was greater on the heading and ripening stages (36-52%) than on the tillering stage (8-26%). Elevated atmospheric CO2 significantly increased AOA and AOB abundance at the heading and ripening stages. Treatment of WA (warming of canopy air) alone did not affect the abundance or community structure of AOA or AOB in the rice rhizosphere at any growth stage. The simultaneous application of CO2 enrichment and warming affected ammonia oxidizer communities differently than independent application of CO2 enrichment or warming, with warming negating the stimulating effect of CO2 enrichment. Phylogenic analysis indicated that all AOA clones fell within the soil and sediment lineage while all AOB clones were classified as Nitrosospira. Although no changes to soil NH4+ or NO3- contents were found, potential nitrification rate generally increased under the treatments with elevated CO2 at all rice growth stages. This could imply a complexity of the joint effect by elevated CO2 on soil properties, plant N uptake and microbial growth. These results suggest that impacts of climate change on N transformation in the rice paddy occur through interactions between effects of climate change on ammonia oxidizer communities and soil properties. Further studies would be required on multiple effects by simulated climate changes on soil properties, N transformations and microbial communities, for a sound understanding of potential changes in N cycling and rice productivity under global climate change.

In the morphospecies complex of the bacterivorous nematode Litoditis marina, four cryptic species (Pm I, Pm II, Pm III and Pm IV) frequently occur with mostly two or more of these species together. This co-occurrence displays fluctuating abundances that have been linked to seasonal dynamics in the environment. In intertidal marine environments, salinity and temperature play an important role in species distributions. In the here presented experiments, the impact of these two abiotic variables on juvenile development time, fecundity and population development was investigated. Monospecific cultures were reared at three different temperatures: 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C (salinity 25) and at two different salinities: 15 and 25 (temperature: 20 degrees C) in 2 separate experiments. Our results showed that differences in life history are present between the four species: Pm III had a higher instantaneous fecundity than the other three species. Furthermore, differences in reproduction strategy were observed between the cryptic species: Pm II and Pm III were always oviparous in this experiment, whilst Pm land Pm IV were mostly viviparous species. Abiotic factors affected the life history characters and the reproductive strategy of some of these cryptic species, with temperature clearly having a stronger effect than salinity. Temperature had an effect on juvenile development time for all species and a species-specific influence on population development. Pm III performed better at higher temperature, Pm II and Pm IV at lower temperature, whereas Pm I proved to be a more eurytherm species, which nicely correlates with their respective seasonal field distribution pattern in the south-eastern coast of the North Sea and adjacent estuaries. Juvenile development time was also influenced by salinity, with a shorter development time at the lower salinity for all cryptic species. Moreover, Pm III and Pm IV performed better at lower than at the higher salinity. Pm IV also changed its reproductive strategy, depending on the salinity. The effect of salinity was less clearly reflected in the geographical distribution of the four species. Different temperature preferences of the cryptic species on the other hand may result in niche differentiation and can provide an important mechanism for coexistence of these closely related species.

Diapause patterns are evolutionary constrained because producing diapause is resource demanding, which might have implications for competitive dynamics and competitor coexistence through mechanisms such as the storage effect. Besides these implications, competition intensity might affect the quality of the diapausing stages and the reproductive success of the offspring emerging from them. We experimentally analysed traits involved in diapause in the cyclically parthenogenetic rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus, in relation to the presence of its competitor, the cladoceran Moina micrura. Under competition with Moina, Brachionus produced fewer diapausing eggs, most of which possessed visual attributes indicating a higher quality. These diapausing eggs produced under a competitive environment had a higher hatching success; however, the hatchlings exhibited a lower population growth rate. We propose the existence of trade-offs between traits related to diapause: the number of produced eggs, quality of these eggs and hatchling performance. Our results show that interspecific competition may cause fine-tuned changes in the life cycle patterns of the populations. Furthermore, these changes could affect that abundance and performance of competitors and thereby drive back effects on the competitive output. These diapause-driven feedback mechanisms may have strong implications for the dynamics of the natural communities.","2015",NA,"10.1007/s00442-014-3172-7","WOS:000347406500025"

Complex soil matrixes can support a vast number of organisms that can provide a site-specific signal for use in forensic soil discrimination. Previous DNA fingerprinting techniques rely on variations in fragment length to distinguish between soil profiles and focus solely on microbial communities. However, the recent development of high throughput sequencing (HTS) has the potential to provide a more detailed picture of the soil community by accessing non-culturable microorganisms and by identifying specific bacteria, fungi, and plants within soil. To demonstrate the application of HTS to forensic soil analysis, 18S ribosomal RNA profiles of six forensic mock crime scene samples were compared to those collected from seven reference locations across South Australia. Our results demonstrate the utility of non-bacterial DNA to discriminate between different sites, and were able to link a soil to a particular location. In addition, HTS complemented traditional Mid Infrared (MIR) spectroscopy soil profiling, but was able to provide statistically stronger discriminatory power at a finer scale.

Regulatory entities request that cell cultures must be mycoplasma-free. Mycoplasma contamination remains a significant problem for cell cultures and may have an impact on biological analysis since they affect many cell parameters. The gold standard microbiological assay for mycoplasma detection involves laborious and time-consuming protocols. PCR-based and Bioluminescent assays have been considered for routine cell culture screening in research laboratories since they are fast, easy and sensitive. Thus, the aim of this work is to compare the performance of two popular commercial assays, PCR-based and Bioluminescent assays, by assessing the level of mycoplasma contamination in cell cultures from Rio de Janeiro Cell Bank (RJCB) and also from customers' laboratories. The results obtained by both performed assays were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. In addition, we evaluated the limit of detection of the PCR kit under our laboratory conditions and the storage effects on mycoplasma detection in frozen cell culture supernatants. The performance of both assays for mycoplasma detection was not significantly different and they showed very good agreement. The Bioluminescent assay for mycoplasma detection was slightly more dependable than PCR-based due to the lack of inconclusive results produced by the first technique, especially considering the ability to detect mycoplasma contamination in frozen cell culture supematants. However, cell lines should be precultured for four days or more without antibiotics to obtain safe results. On the other hand, a false negative result was obtained by using this biochemical approach. The implementation of fast and reliable mycoplasma testing methods is an important technical and regulatory issue and PCR-based and Bioluminescent assays may be good candidates. However, validation studies are needed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","2015",NA,"10.1016/j.mimet.2015.08.010","WOS:000364892300005"

In contrast to temperate soils, there is little information regarding the advantages and disadvantages of using fieldmoist or air-dried soil samples in the assessment of enzyme activities in tropical soils. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of air-drying and a two-year storage period on beta-glucosidase, acid phosphatase and arylsulfatase activities in soil samples from cultivated and non-cultivated clayey Oxisols from the Cerrado region. Cultivated soil samples (0-10 cm depth) were collected from 24 treatments in three long-term experiments and analyzed to determine their enzyme activities and soil organic carbon (SOC). These treatments presented a large range of extractable Mehlich-P values and cumulative corn and soybean yields. Non-cultivated soil samples from four nearby areas with native Cerrado vegetation were also included in the study. In the laboratory, soil samples were divided into two groups. In the first group, soil samples were separated, stored at 7 degrees C at field moisture levels and sieved through a 4 mm sieve. The analyses were performed within 1 week after sampling. In the second group, soil samples were air-dried at room temperature for two weeks, sieved through a 2 mm sieve and stored for 2 years at room temperature. Average reductions of 26%, 53% and 72%, were observed in the activities of beta-glucosidase, arylsulfatase and acid phosphatase in the air-dried long-term stored samples, in both cultivated and noncultivated Cerrado clayey Oxisols. Air-drying and long-term storage hardly changed the ranking of treatments for beta-glucosidase, arylsulfatase and acid phosphatase. However, a reduction in the capacity to detect changes among treatments was observed for acid phosphatase, which prevents the recommendation of air-drying prior to its analyses. As long as the effects of air-drying upon soil enzymes activities are well established, this pretreatment can be used for b-glucosidase and arylsulfatase analyses in the Cerrado clayey Oxisols.

Therefore, learning from nature and biomimetic mineralization become one of important approaches to advanced materials. Research on the biomineralization indicate that certain biomolecules play a key important role during the biosilica formation. For example, silaffins and long chain polyamine extracted from diatom and silicateins from sponges, control the nucleation and growth of silicious species at a molecular level by manipulating the interfacial interactions between organic molecules and inorganic species, and therefore result in the generation of biosilica with organized hierarchical structures. Simulating the biomineralization process, people have, prepared silica nanomaterials with various morphologies, structures and properties based on the designed organic molecules during the recent decades. In this review, four sections are involved. Firstly, we introduce the results about the formation mechanism of biosilica including the identification of bioextracts and their functions, catalyzing and stabilizing mechanisms, morphology generation of biosilica. Secondly but importantly, we review the recent progress in biomimetic synthesis of silica. This content can also be divided into four units, bioextracts regulating biosilicification, artificial synthetic molecules mediating mineralization, external forces driving morphogenesis and tools in biomimetic mineralization. Thirdly, we introduc the potential application of biomimeticly synthesized silica in cell culture, drug and gene delivery system, catalysis, separation and detection, protecting biomolecules and functional materials construction.

Thus, we analyzed the distribution of soil aggregates and assessed quality, quantity, and distribution of SOM in two unimproved and improved (two organic and two conventional) grasslands in subarctic Iceland, in Haplic and Histic Andosols. We also evaluated principal physicochemical and biological soil properties, which influence soil aggregation and SOM dynamics. Macroaggregates (>250 mu m) in topsoils were most prominent in unimproved (62-77%) and organically (58-69%) managed sites, whereas 20-250 mu m aggregates were the most prominent in conventionally managed sites (51-53%). Macroaggregate stability in topsoils, measured as mean weight diameter, was approximately twice as high in organically managed (12-20 mm) compared with the conventionally managed (5-8 mm) sites, possibly due to higher organic inputs (e.g., manure, compost, and cattle urine). In unimproved grasslands and one organic site, macroaggregates contributed between 40% and 70% of soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen to bulk soil, whereas in high SOM concentration sites free particulate organic matter contributed up to 70% of the SOC and nitrogen to bulk soil. Aggregate hierarchy in Haplic Andosols was confirmed by different stabilizing mechanisms of micro- and macroaggregates, however, somewhat diminished by oxides (pyrophosphate-, oxalate-, and dithionite-extractable Fe, Al, and Mn) acting as binding agents for macroaggregates. In Histic Andosols, no aggregate hierarchy was observed. The higher macroaggregate stability in organic farming practice compared with conventional farming is of interest due to the importance of macroaggregates in protecting SOM and soils from erosion, which is a prerequisite for soil functions in grasslands that are envisaged for food production in the future.","2015",NA,"10.1080/09064710.2014.1001778","WOS:000350385700005"
"Hilt, S","Regime shifts between macrophytes and phytoplankton - concepts beyond shallow lakes, unravelling stabilizing mechanisms and practical consequences","LIMNETICA","Feedback mechanisms between macrophytes and water clarity resulting in the occurrence of alternative stable states have been described in a theoretical concept for shallow lakes. Here, I review recent studies applying the concept to other freshwater systems, unravelling stabilizing mechanisms and discussing consequences of regime shifts. Recent modelling studies predict that abrupt changes between clear and turbid water states can also occur in lowland rivers, both in time and in space. These findings were supported by long-term data from rivers in Spain and Germany. A deep lake model revealed that submerged macrophytes may also significantly reduce phytoplankton biomass by 50-15 % in 100-11 m deep and oligotrophic lakes. Some of the mechanisms stabilizing clear-water conditions are still far from fully understood. Available data suggest that the macrophyte community composition affects number and type of mechanisms stabilizing clear-water conditions. Allelopathic effects of macrophytes on phytoplankton are no longer doubted, however, bacterial colonization of macrophytes and phytoplankton, phytoplankton interactions, local adaptations and strain-specific sensitivities have been found to modulate these interactions. New aspects on stability properties of shallow lake ecosystems arose from experimental and modelling studies on terrestrial organic matter input, both in dissolved (tDOM) and particulate (tPOM) form. These suggest that the likelihood that shallow lakes will shift to or stay in the turbid state is enhanced with a predicted future increase in tDOM and tPOM input. Shallow lake restoration still suffers from knowledge gaps such as the role of propagule availability and dispersal for the re-establishment of a diverse submerged macrophyte vegetation. The importance of lake regime shifts, however, is increasingly supported by studies on quantitative consequences for processes such as primary production, carbon emissions and carbon burial.","2015",NA,NA,"WOS:000366881500016"

In this paper, we used phytoplankton occurrence data, from a French national phytoplankton monitoring network, and environmental variables with the aim of characterizing the realized ecological niches of phytoplankton groups. We selected 35 phytoplankton taxa representing the most important taxa in terms of occurrence frequency and abundance along the French coast of the eastern English Channel, the Southern Bight of the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. We show that environmental variables such as nutrient concentration, water temperature, irradiance and turbidity can be considered key factors controlling phytoplankton dynamics and influencing the community structure. By using a statistical framework based on an ordination technique the community structure was analyzed and interpreted in terms of niche overlap, marginality and tolerance. The most marginal taxon was Dactyliosolen and the most tolerant was Skeletonema. Non-marginal taxonomic units could be generalist and specialist, while marginal taxa were rather specialist.

The process of decomposition is expected to benefit from interspecific bacterial interactions such as resource partitioning and facilitation. However, the relative importance of resource niche breadth (metabolic diversity) and resource niche overlap (functional redundancy) on decomposition and the temporal stability of ecosystem processes received little scientific attention. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effect of an increase in bacterial community resemblance on both decomposition and the stability of bacterial metabolism in aquatic sediments. To this end, we performed laboratory microcosm experiments in which we examined the influence of bacterial consortia differing in number and composition of species on bacterial activity (Electron Transport System Activity, ETSA), dissolved organic carbon production and wavelet transformed measurements of redox potential (Eh). Single substrate affinities of the individual bacterial species were determined in order to calculate the metabolic diversity of the microbial community. Results presented here indicate that bacterial activity and organic matter decomposition increase with widening of the resource niche breadth, and that metabolic stability increases with increasing overlap in bacterial resource niches, hinting that resource niche overlap can promote the stability of bacterial community metabolism.","2015",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2015.00105","WOS:000350348700001"

We analyzed delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotope ratios of food resources and fish muscle tissues in four Chinese lakes, where these two species co-occur. Data analysis through Bayesian mixing models revealed that both fish species had similar diets within lakes, and where dietary shifts occurred, both species displayed dietary shifts simultaneously. Diet was generally based on plankton, however, detritus was the main food in eutrophic lake subjected to urban pollution, likely due to resource availability. Niche overlap and width were also variable but in general clear size-based resource partitioning was observed, with bighead carp preying more on zooplankton and occupying a higher trophic position and silver carp feeding more on phytoplankton.

Here, we explore how the structure, function, and biodiversity of a planktonic metacommunity was altered after five years of experimental warming. Our outdoor mesocosm experiment was open to natural dispersal from the regional species pool, allowing us to explore the effects of experimental warming in the context of metacommunity dynamics. Warming of 4 degrees C led to a 67% increase in the species richness of the phytoplankton, more evenly-distributed abundance, and higher rates of gross primary productivity. Warming elevated productivity indirectly, by increasing the biodiversity and biomass of the local phytoplankton communities. Warming also systematically shifted the taxonomic and functional trait composition of the phytoplankton, favoring large, colonial, inedible phytoplankton taxa, suggesting stronger top-down control, mediated by zooplankton grazing played an important role. Overall, our findings suggest that temperature can modulate species coexistence, and through such mechanisms, global warming could, in some cases, increase the species richness and productivity of phytoplankton communities.","2015",NA,"10.1371/journal.pbio.1002324","WOS:000368443000016"

We analysed size diversity patterns of phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish assemblages in 13 data sets from freshwater and marine sites with the aim to assess whether there is a general trend in the effect of predation and resource competition on body size distribution across a wide range of aquatic ecosystems. We used size diversity as a measure of the shape of size distribution. Size diversity was computed based on the Shannon-Wiener diversity expression, adapted to a continuous variable, i.e. as body size. Our results show that greater predation pressure was associated with reduced size diversity of prey at all trophic levels. In contrast, competition effects depended on the trophic level considered. At upper trophic levels (zooplankton and fish), size distributions were more diverse when potential resource availability was low, suggesting that competitive interactions for resources promote diversification of aquatic communities by size. This pattern was not found for phytoplankton size distributions where size diversity mostly increased with low zooplankton grazing and increasing nutrient availability. Relationships we found were weak, indicating that predation and competition are not the only determinants of size distribution. Our results suggest that predation pressure leads to accumulation of organisms in the less predated sizes, while resource competition tends to favour a wider size distribution.","2015",NA,"10.1007/s00027-014-0368-1","WOS:000347149700005"

However, new algorithms to analyze genome sequence information in the context of community structure are needed to enhance our understanding of the specific ecological roles of these organisms in soil environments. We present a machine learning approach using sequenced Pseudomonad genomes coupled with outputs of metabolic and transportomic computational models for identifying the most predictive molecular mechanisms indicative of a Pseudomonad's ecological role in the rhizosphere: a biofilm, biocontrol agent, promoter of plant growth, or plant pathogen. Computational predictions of ecological niche were highly accurate overall with models trained on transportomic model output being the most accurate (Leave One Out Validation F-scores between 0.82 and 0.89). The strongest predictive molecular mechanism features for rhizosphere ecological niche overlap with many previously reported analyses of Pseudomonad interactions in the rhizosphere, suggesting that this approach successfully informs a system-scale level understanding of how Pseudomonads sense and interact with their environments. The observation that an organism's transportome is highly predictive of its ecological niche is a novel discovery and may have implications in our understanding microbial ecology. The framework developed here can be generalized to the analysis of any bacteria across a wide range of environments and ecological niches making this approach a powerful tool for providing insights into functional predictions from bacterial genomic data.","2015",NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0132837","WOS:000360613800002"

The assemblage was found in basin clays, but was transported from nearby carbonate platforms as indicated by fragmentation, microbial encrustation and the presence of coated grains and ooids. Most of the specimens are small (< 1cm) reflecting both, small adult sizes and size sorting during transport. Rarefaction analysis suggests that diversity of surface collection and bulk sampling is the same. However, rank abundance, species richness and taxonomic composition differ strongly according to sampling method. Low-grade lithification of the sediments is the main reason that high diversity can be recognized, because it facilitates disaggregation and finding of small molluscs. Sample standardization shows that the studied assemblage is much more diverse than known Early Triassic assemblages. However, its diversity is similar to that of Anisian assemblages. This suggests that recovery from the end-Permian mass-extinction was quite advanced in the Middle Triassic and alpha-diversity remained high until the Late Triassic. According to current models, Early Triassic and Anisian faunas match the niche overlap phase of recovery during which diversity is built up by increasing alpha-diversity, whereas beta-diversity rises slowly. Subsequently, habitat width of species contracts because of increasing competition, making beta-diversity the principal drive of overall diversity increase. The diversity pattern of various Late Triassic Cassian associations meets the predictions for the transition from the niche overlap to the habitat contraction phase.: Triassic, Cassian Formation, palaeoecology, diversity, mollusc dominance.","2015",NA,"10.1111/let.12102","WOS:000351736600009"

However, species coexistence is often possible only in spatially extended systems with a limited range of dispersal, whereas in well-mixed environments models for cyclic competition often lead to a loss of biodiversity. Here we consider the dispersal of biological species in a fluid environment, where mixing is achieved by a combination of advection and diffusion. In particular, we perform a detailed numerical analysis of a model composed of turbulent advection, diffusive transport, and cyclic interactions among biological species in two spatial dimensions and discuss the circumstances under which biodiversity is maintained when external environmental conditions, such as resource supply, are uniform in space. Cyclic interactions are represented by a model with three competitors, resembling the children's game of rock-paper-scissors, whereas the flow field is obtained from a direct numerical simulation of two-dimensional turbulence with hyperviscosity. It is shown that the space-averaged dynamics undergoes bifurcations as the relative strengths of advection and diffusion compared to biological interactions are varied.","2015",NA,"10.1103/PhysRevE.91.033009","WOS:000351042700010"

Stable coexistence of many species is commonly observed in natural communities. Most of these natural communities, however, are composed of species from multiple trophic and functional groups, while theory and experiments on coexistence have been focusing on functionally similar species. Here, we investigated how functional diversity affects the stability of species coexistence and productivity in multispecies communities by characterizing experimentally all pairwise species interactions in a pool of 11 species of eukaryotes (10 protists and one rotifer) belonging to three different functional groups. Species within the same functional group showed stronger competitive interactions compared to among-functional group interactions. This often led to competitive exclusion between species that had higher functional relatedness, but only at low levels of species richness. Communities with higher functional diversity resulted in increased species coexistence and community biomass production. Our experimental findings and the results of a stochastic model tailored to the experimental interaction matrix suggest the emergence of strong stabilizing forces when species from different functional groups interact in a homogeneous environment. By combining theoretical analysis with experiments we could also disentangle the relationship between species richness and functional diversity, showing that functional diversity per se is a crucial driver of productivity and stability in multispecies community.","2015",NA,"10.1890/14-1324.1","WOS:000354119300018"

Here, we experimentally test how the underlying resource competition networks of resident bacterial communities affect invasion resistance to the plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum in microcosms and in tomato plant rhizosphere. We find that bipartite resource competition networks are better predictors of invasion resistance compared with resident community diversity. Specifically, communities with a combination of stabilizing configurations (low nestedness and high connectance), and a clear niche overlap with the pathogen, reduce pathogen invasion success, constrain pathogen growth within invaded communities and have lower levels of diseased plants in greenhouse experiments. Bacterial resource competition network characteristics can thus be important in explaining positive diversity-invasion resistance relationships in bacterial rhizosphere communities.","2015",NA,"10.1038/ncomms9413","WOS:000363138400005"
"Mcgee, KM; Eaton, WD","A comparison of the wet and dry season DNA-based soil invertebrate community characteristics in large patches of the bromeliad Bromelia pinguin in a primary forest in Costa Rica","APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY","In Costa Rica, the Maquenque National Wildlife Refuge (MNWLR) contains a unique habitat gradient ranging from primary old growth forests, grasslands, pastures, to various ages of secondary forests. Within these primary old growth forests are extremely dense naturally occurring Bromelia pinguin (Bromeliaceae) patches that often grow with densities up to 2 plants per square meter. A previous study found that anti-fungal activity of this particular plant appears to be altering the fungal community in soils adjacent to these plants. No work has been previously conducted on the possible effects of this plant community on soil faunal communities and if seasonality contributes to changes in soil invertebrate populations along a moisture gradient. Thus, a study was conducted to assess the effects of this specialized plant community on soil invertebrates with respect to season, and if these changes in soil fauna guild structure could prove to be valid candidates as indicators of ecosystem condition with changes in precipitation. In addition, a meta-analysis was done to determine how the bromeliad-associated soil invertebrate communities differ from those in adjacent primary forest soils. Therefore, comparisons were determined from previous primary forest soil invertebrate environmental DNA (eDNA) to the current wet season bromeliad soil invertebrate eDNA. Roche 454 pyro-sequencing was conducted on the 650 bp fragment of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene of invertebrates to obtain and characterize soil invertebrate sequence composition. To determine relationships among soil fauna guilds across seasons, relative abundance of the sequences were calculated, and used in conjunction with EcoSim niche overlap and co-occurrence values. From the bromeliad seasonal soil fauna eDNA study, it appears certain invertebrate guilds are driven by moisture as indicated by fluctuations in relative abundance of each invertebrate guild across seasons in bromeliad patch soils, as well as indicated by EcoSim niche overlap values. In particular, Guilds 1, 4, and 5, should warrant further investigation as indicators of habitat condition. The meta-analysis showed that a naturally occurring modified environment (the bromeliad patches), can result in differences in relative abundance and partitioning of a limited resource between invertebrate guild structure. Those guilds associated with microbivorous and complex decomposition activities (i.e. Guilds 3 and 4), are more abundant in primary forest soils than bromeliad patch soils and could potentially used for bioindicators of habitat perturbations.

Carbon (delta C-13) isotopic analyses revealed that pelagic and benthonic sources are part of the feeding of the fish from the different guilds (-14.0 to -24.8 %). The benthic sources are usually enriched in delta C-13 (-16.9%, from watershed runoff) compared to pelagic sources because the phytoplankton, important primary producer that supports several pelagic chains, has delta C-13 signature lighter (-23.9%). The nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopic signatures indicated that most guilds were at the same trophic position (10.0 to 15.5 %), except for pelagic omnivorous fish, which had a lower trophic position. Niche overlap was observed among pelagic and demersal carnivorous fish, demersal omnivorous fish, and demersal detritivorous fish. The lower isotopic niche breadth of pelagic carnivorous fish reveals the specialized resource use by this guild. Hg concentrations (ng g(-1) dry weight) differed significantly between demersal carnivorous fish (185.3 dry weight; 27.8 wet weight) and demersal omnivorous fish (277.9 dry weight; 41.7 wet weight) and between pelagic omnivorous fish (197.2 dry weight; 29.6 wet weight) and demersal omnivorous fish due to (1) differences in food sources: guilds that fed on bottom resources were more affected by contamination because the sediment is an important Hg accumulator in the study area, and (2) because of its trophic positions. Considering that the fish consumed prey of similar trophic positions, the guilds did not show a well-defined food hierarchy. Therefore, in this study, there was no clear relationship between Hg and delta N-15.","2015",NA,"10.1590/1982-0224-20150047","WOS:000367481800009"

The study was performed in four lagoons and in one sampling site of the main channel in Rosana Reservoir, Paranapanema River, Brazil. The samples were taken in September and November of 2004 and in January, March, May, and August of 2005. Fish were sampled with a 7.5 m(2) hand net. Five manual throws were made toward aquatic macrophytes stands. The sampling design favored the collection of small-sized fish fauna (juveniles/small-sized species). The stomach contents of 42 species were analyzed. A total of 183 different items were consumed by fish. These items were grouped in 11 food categories, which were used to classify fish into seven trophic guilds. Aquatic insects were consumed by 32 species and were the predominant feeding item. In the river, the most consumed items were aquatic insects, cladocerans, and phytoplankton, whereas in the lagoons aquatic insects, copepods, and cladocerans were the main items. By comparing each trophic guild, the number of insectivores, algivores, and zooplanktivores species was higher in the lagoons than in the river, and the opposite was found only for omnivore fish. Low niche width in all sites indicates high trophic specialization and low niche overlap between pairs of species. Fish assemblage in the lateral lagoons presents feeding habits distinct from those of the river species, indicating that the coexistence and high abundance of small-sized fish in the sampling sites are explained by their high feeding adaptability, which includes a tendency toward dietary specialization, low feeding overlap, and resource partitioning, along with different temporal resource uses.","2015",NA,"10.1590/1519-6984.14713","WOS:000357522100018"

Theory predicts that species persistence and community stability are feasible when the beneficial effects of mutualisms are balanced by density-dependent negative feedbacks. Enemy-mediated negative feedbacks can foster plant species coexistence in diverse communities, but empirical evidence remains mixed. Disparity between theoretical expectations and empirical results may arise from the effects of mutualistic mycorrhizal fungi. Here, we build a multiprey species/predator model combined with a bidirectional resource exchange system, which simulates mutualistic interactions between plants and fungi. To reach population persistence, (1) the per capita rate of increase of all plant population must exceed the sum of the negative per capita effects of predation, interspecific competition, and costs of mycorrhizal association, and (2) the per capita numerical response of enemies to mycorrhizal plants must exceed the magnitude of the per capita enemy rate of mortality. These conditions reflect the balance between regulation and facilitation in the system. Interactions between plant natural enemies and mycorrhizal fungi lead to shifts in the strength and direction of net mycorrhizal effects on plants over time, with common plant species deriving greater benefits from mycorrhizal associations than rare plant species.","2015",NA,"10.1007/s12080-015-0251-2","WOS:000361495000003"

The commonly observed pattern of links between specialists and generalists in these networks has been predicted to promote species coexistence. Plants also build highly species-rich mutualistic networks below ground with rootassociated fungi, and the structure of these plant-fungus networksmay also affect terrestrial community processes. By compiling high-throughput DNA sequencing data sets of the symbiosis of plants and their root-associated fungi fromthree localities along a latitudinal gradient, we uncovered the entire network architecture of these interactions under contrasting environmental conditions. Each network included more than 30 plant species and hundreds of mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi belonging to diverse phylogenetic groups. The results were consistent with the notion that processes shaping host-plant specialization of fungal species generate a unique linkage pattern that strongly contrasts with the pattern of above-ground plant-partner networks. Specifically, plant-fungus networks lacked a nested architecture, which has been considered to promote species coexistence in plant-partner networks. Rather, the below-ground networks had a conspicuous antinested topology. Our findings lead to the working hypothesis that terrestrial plant community dynamics are likely determined by the balance between above ground and below-ground webs of interspecific interactions.","2015",NA,"10.1126/sciadv.1500291","WOS:000216598200031"

This shape of isoclines corresponds with the Lotka-Volterra and the Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey models that assume a prey refuge.

Biofungicide yeasts were classified into antifungal patterns, according to their mechanisms of action. Thirty isolates presented at least two of the mechanisms assayed.

This study addressed the variation in the microbial activity and bacterial community in the rhizosphere of own-root bottle gourd (rootstock), own-root watermelon, and grafted-root watermelon under field conditions and tried to clarify how bacterial communities in the rhizosphere responded to grafting of watermelon. Methods Seven types of soil enzyme activities were tested by microplate fluorometric assay, and the root-associated bacterial community was compared using 454 pyrosequencing. Results Clear distinctions in microbial activity and taxonomic levels between the different treatments were obtained. Compared with grafted-root watermelon, ungrafted watermelon recruited significantly higher beneficial bacterial genera, such as Bacillus spp. and Paenibacillus spp., suggesting the grafted watermelon root could not have the ability to harbor highly beneficial bacteria to exert soil-borne disease resistance. However, a significantly higher Shannon-Wiener index at any reads level was found in the rhizosphere of grafted watermelon compared with ungrafted watermelon. Conclusions Root-associated bacteria of grafted watermelon possess a broader niche overlap which would provide the potential to exclude the pathogen challenge. We proposed that the grafted watermelon might exert soil-borne disease resistance by maximizing the niche occupancy of rhizosphere rather than by recruiting more beneficial bacteria.","2015",NA,"10.1007/s11104-015-2399-3","WOS:000354197100018"

While placozoans have become an emerging model system, their ecology and particularly biogeography remain widely unknown. In this study, we use modelling approaches to explore habitat preferences, and distribution pattern of the placozoans phylum. We provide hypotheses for discrete ecological niche separation between genetic placozoan lineages, which may also help to understand biogeography patterns in other small marine invertebrates. We, here, used maximum entropy modelling to predict placozoan distribution using 20 environmental grids of 9.2 km(2) resolution. In addition, we used recently developed metrics of niche overlap to compare habitat suitability models of three genetic clades. The predicted distributions range from 55 degrees N to 44 degrees S and are restricted to regions of intermediate to warm sea surface temperatures. High concentrations of salinity and low nutrient concentrations appear as secondary factors. Tests of niche equivalency reveal the largest differences between placozoan clades I and III. Interestingly, the genetically well-separated clades I and V appear to be ecologically very similar. Our habitat suitability models predict a wider latitudinal distribution for placozoans, than currently described, especially in the northern hemisphere. With respect to biogeography modelling, placozoans show patterns somewhere between higher metazoan taxa and marine microorganisms, with the first group usually showing complex biogeographies and the second usually showing no biogeography.","2015",NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0140162","WOS:000365154600003"

Collodarians are known to play an important role in oceanic food webs as both active predators and hosts of symbiotic microalgae, yet very little is known about their diversity and evolution. Taxonomic delineation of collodarians is challenging and only a few species have been genetically characterized. Here we investigated collodarian diversity using phylogenetic analyses of both nuclear small (18S) and large (28S) subunits of the ribosomal DNA, including 124 new sequences from 75 collodarians sampled worldwide. The resulting molecular phylogeny was compared to morphology-based classification. Our analyses distinguished the monophyletic clade of skeleton-less and spicule-bearing Sphaerozoidae from the sister clades Collosphaeridae (skeleton-bearing) and Collophidiidae (skeleton-less), while the Thalassicollidae was not retrieved as a monophyletic clade. Detailed morphological examination with electron microscopy combined with molecular analyses revealed many discrepancies, such as a mix between solitary and colonial species, co-existence of skeleton-less and skeleton-bearing specimens within the Collosphaeridae, as well as complex intraspecific variability in silicified structures. Such observations challenge a morphology-based classification and highlight the pertinence of an integrative taxonomic approach to study collodarian diversity. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

However, little is known about how biotic plant soil interactions influence the local dominance and abundance of plant species and whether specific taxonomic or functional groups of plants are differentially affected by such biotic soil-effects. In two greenhouse experiments, we tested the biotic soil-effects of 33 grassland species differing in individual size and local abundance. We hypothesized that large plants that are not locally dominant (despite their size-related competitive advantage enabling them to potentially outshade competitors) are most strongly limited by negative biotic soil-effects. We sampled soils at the opposite ends of a gradient in land-use intensity in temperate grasslands to account for putative modulating effects of land-use intensity on biotic soil-effects. As hypothesized, large, but non-dominant species (especially grasses) experienced more negative biotic soil-effects compared with small and abundant plant species. Land-use intensity had contrasting effects on grasses and herbs resulting in more negative biotic soil-effects for grasses in less intensively managed grasslands. We conclude that biotic soil-effects contribute to the control of potentially dominant plants and hence enable species coexistence and biodiversity especially in species-rich less intensively managed grasslands.

What maintains parasite diversity? Here I argue that competition among parasites within the host is a major cause of variation among parasites. The competitive environment within the host can vary depending on the parasite genotypes present. For example, parasite strategies that target specific competitors, such as bacteriocins, are dependent on the presence and susceptibility of those competitors for success. Accordingly, which parasite traits are favoured by within-host selection can vary from host to host. Given the fluctuating fitness landscape across hosts, genotype by genotype (G x G) interactions among parasites should be prevalent. Moreover, selection should vary in a frequency-dependent manner, as attacking genotypes select for resistance and genotypes producing public goods select for cheaters. I review competitive coexistence theory with regard to parasites and highlight a few key examples where within-host competition promotes diversity. Finally, I discuss how within-host competition affects host health and our ability to successfully treat infectious diseases.","2015",NA,"10.1098/rstb.2014.0301","WOS:000358758700006"

The potential for infectious pathogens to spillover and emerge from managed populations to wildlife communities is poorly understood, but ecological, evolutionary and anthropogenic factors are all likely to influence the initial exposure and subsequent infection, spread and impact of disease. Fast-evolving RNA viruses, known to cause severe colony losses in managed honeybee populations, deserve particular attention for their propensity to jump between host species and thus threaten ecologically and economically important wild pollinator communities. 2. We review the literature on pollinator viruses to identify biological and anthropogenic drivers of disease emergence, highlight gaps in the literature, and discuss potential management strategies. 3. We provide evidence that many wild pollinator species are exposed to viruses from commercial species, resulting in multiple spillover events. However, it is not clear whether species become infected as a result of spillover or whether transmission is occurring within these wild populations. Ecological traits of pollinating insects, such as overlapping ranges, niches and behaviours, clearly promote cross-species transmission of RNA viruses. Moreover, we conclude that the social behaviour and phylogenetic relatedness of social pollinators further facilitate within-and between-host transmission, leaving these species particularly vulnerable to emerging diseases. 4. We argue that the commercial use of pollinators is a key driver of disease emergence in these beneficial insects and that this must be addressed by management and policy. 5. Synthesis and applications. There are important knowledge gaps, ranging from disease distribution and prevalence, to pathogen life history and virulence, to the impacts of disease emergence, which need to be addressed as research priorities. It is clear that avoiding anthropogenic pathogen spillover is crucial to preventing and managing disease emergence in pollinators, with far-reaching effects on our food security, ecosystem services and biodiversity. We argue that it is crucial to prevent the introduction of diseased pollinators into natural environments, which can be achieved through improved monitoring and management practices.","2015",NA,"10.1111/1365-2664.12385","WOS:000352138100007"

Natural communities commonly contain many different species and functional groups, and multiple types of species interactions act simultaneously, such as competition, predation, commensalism or mutualism. However, experimental and theoretical investigations have generally been limited by focusing on one type of interaction at a time or by a lack of a common methodological and conceptual approach to measure species interactions. 2. We compared four methods to measure and express species interactions. These approaches are, with increasing degree of model complexity, an extinction-based model, a relative yield model and two generalized Lotka-Volterra (LV) models. All four approaches have been individually applied in different fields of community ecology, but rarely integrated. We provide an overview of the definitions, assumptions and data needed for the specific methods and apply them to empirical data by experimentally deriving the interaction matrices among 11 protist and rotifer species, belonging to three functional groups. Furthermore, we compare their advantages and limitations to predict multispecies community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. 3. The relative yield method is, in terms of final biomass production, the best method in predicting the 11-species community dynamics from the pairwise competition experiments. The LV model, which is considering equilibrium among the species, suffers from experimental constraints given the strict equilibrium assumption, and this may be rarely satisfied in ecological communities. 4. We show how simulations of a LV stochastic community model, derived from an empirical interaction matrix, can be used to predict multispecies community dynamics across multiple functional groups. 5.Our work unites available tools to measure species interactions under one framework. This improves our ability to make management-oriented predictions of species coexistence/extinction and to compare ecosystem processes across study systems.","2015",NA,"10.1111/2041-210X.12363","WOS:000359784100004"

However, the sole presence of paper might prevent rock from beating scissors, simply because paper beats rock. This is the blueprint for the rock-paper-scissors game with protection spillovers, which has recently been introduced as a new paradigm for biodiversity in well-mixed microbial populations. Here we study the game in structured populations, demonstrating that protection spillovers give rise to spatial patterns that are impossible to observe in the classical rock-paper-scissors game. We show that the spatiotemporal dynamics of the system is determined by the density of stable vortices, which may ultimately transform to frozen states, to propagating waves, or to target waves with reversed propagation direction, depending further on the degree and type of randomness in the interactions among the species. If vortices are rare, the fixation to waves and complex oscillatory solutions is likelier. Moreover, annealed randomness in interactions favors the emergence of target waves, while quenched randomness favors collective synchronization. Our results demonstrate that protection spillovers may fundamentally change the dynamics of cyclic dominance in structured populations, and they outline the possibility of programming pattern formation in microbial populations.","2015",NA,"10.1088/1367-2630/17/11/113033","WOS:000365896800001"

However, for the purposes of reconstructing vent food webs and for tracking energy flow from the generation of rock and fluid chemistry through primary/ secondary productivity and consumption to the overlying water column, it remains unclear which consumers feed on which bacteria. In paired analyses of carbon and nitrogen tissue stable isotope values with unique 16S rRNA sequences from the stomach contents, we determined that two species of gastropod grazers appear to feed on epsilon-proteobacteria, while two other species have more diverse diets, including one species that consumes alpha-proteobacteria, planctomycetes, and non-green sulfur bacteria. Different carbon fixation pathways used by epsilon- and alpha-proteobacteria may account for the variation in the carbon stable isotope values among the consumers. Furthermore, our results indicate that trophic specialization and niche partitioning may contribute to the distribution and abundance of vent-endemic gastropods and support the hypothesis that consumers in the warmer habitats commonly feed on epsilon-proteobacteria that use the rTCA cycle, while in the cooler habitats they feed on additional bacteria that use the CBB cycle. These results suggest that the phylogenetic and metabolic diversity of free-living bacteria may play an important and previously overlooked role in facilitating species coexistence among primary consumers at hydrothermal vents and other chemosynthesis-based ecosystems.

However, few studies have tested whether such interactions can affect species distributions by altering the niches of partner species. In subalpine meadows of the Rocky Mountains, USA, we explored whether the presence of a fungal endophyte (genus Epichloe) may shift the niche of its partner plant, marsh bluegrass (Poa leptocoma) relative to a closely related but endophyte-free grass species, nodding bluegrass (Poa reflexa). Using observations and a 3-year field experiment, we tested two questions: (i) Do P. leptocoma and P. reflexa occupy different ecological niches? and (ii) Does endophyte presence affect the relative fitness of P. leptocoma versus P. reflexa in the putative niches of these grass species? The two species were less likely to co-occur than expected by chance. Specifically, P. leptocoma grew closer to water sources and in wetter soils than P. reflexa, and also had higher root colonization by mycorrhizal fungi. Endophyte-symbiotic P. leptocoma seeds germinated with greater frequency in P. leptocoma niches relative to P. reflexa niches, whereas neither endophyte-free (experimentally removed) P. leptocoma seeds nor P. reflexa seeds showed differential germination between the two niche types. Thus, endophyte presence constrained the germination and early survival of host plants to microsites occupied by P. leptocoma. However, endophyte-symbiotic P. leptocoma ultimately showed greater growth than endophyte-free plants across all microsites, indicating a net benefit of the symbiosis at this life history stage. Differential effects of endophyte symbiosis on different host life history stages may thus contribute to niche partitioning between the two congeneric plant species. Our study therefore identifies a symbiotic relationship as a potential mechanism facilitating the coexistence of two species, suggesting that symbiont effects on host niche may have community-level consequences.","2015",NA,"10.1093/aobpla/plv005","WOS:000357414700001"

We have previously developed a co-infection based method for the assessment of the relative in vivo fitness of two competing viruses. We have also introduced a model of within-host co-infection dynamics that enables relative within-host fitness to be quantified in these competitive-mixtures experiments. The model assumed that fitness differences between co-infecting strains were mediated by strain-dependent viral production rates from infected epithelial cells. Here we extend the model to enable a more complete exploration of biological processes that may differ between virus pairs and hence generate fitness differences. We use the extended model to re-analyse data from competitive-mixtures experiments that investigated the fitness of oseltamivir-resistant (OR) H1N1 pandemic 2009 (H1N1pdm09) viruses that emerged during a community outbreak in Australia in 2011. Results are consistent with those of our previous analysis, suggesting that the within-host replication fitness of these OR viruses is not compromised relative to that of related oseltamivir-susceptible (OS) strains, and that potentially permissive mutations in the neuraminidase gene (V241I and N369K) significantly enhance the fitness of H1N1pdm09 OR viruses. These results are consistent regardless of the hypothesised biological cause of fitness difference. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"Perez-Valera, E; Goberna, M; Verdú, M","Phylogenetic structure of soil bacterial communities predicts ecosystem functioning","FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY","Quantifying diversity with phylogeny-informed metrics helps understand the effects of diversity on ecosystem functioning (EF). The sign of these effects remains controversial because phylogenetic diversity and taxonomic identity may interactively influence EF. Positive relationships, traditionally attributed to complementarity effects, seem unimportant in natural soil bacterial communities. Negative relationships could be attributed to fitness differences leading to the overrepresentation of few productive clades, a mechanism recently invoked to assemble soil bacteria communities. We tested in two ecosystems contrasting in terms of environmental heterogeneity whether two metrics of phylogenetic community structure, a simpler measure of phylogenetic diversity (NRI) and a more complex metric incorporating taxonomic identity (PCPS), correctly predict microbially mediated EF. We show that the relationship between phylogenetic diversity and EF depends on the taxonomic identity of the main coexisting lineages. Phylogenetic diversity was negatively related to EF in soils where a marked fertility gradient exists and a single and productive clade (Proteobacteria) outcompete other clades in the most fertile plots. However, phylogenetic diversity was unrelated to EF in soils where the fertility gradient is less marked and Proteobacteria coexist with other abundant lineages. Including the taxonomic identity of bacterial lineages in metrics of phylogenetic community structure allows the prediction of EF in both ecosystems.","2015",NA,"10.1093/femsec/fiv031","WOS:000355328100006"

Single nucleotide substitutions in the WNV genome may impact viral fitness necessary for WNV adaptation and evolution as previously shown for the WN02 genotype. In an effort to study phenotypic change, we developed an in vivo fitness competition model in two biologically relevant hosts for WNV. The House Finch (HOFI; Haemorhous mexicanus) and Culex tarsalis mosquitoes represent moderately susceptible hosts for WNV, are highly abundant in Western North America and frequently are infected with WNV in nature. Herein, we inoculated HOFIs and Culex tarsalis competitively (dually) and singly with infectious-clone derived viruses of the founding California isolate COAV997-2003 (COAV997-IC), the founding North American isolate NY99 (NY99-IC), and a 2004 field isolate from California (CA-04), and compared the replicative capacities (fitness) of these viruses to a genetically marked virus of COAV997 (COAV997-5nt) by measuring RNA copy numbers. COAV997 and COAV997-5nt exhibited neutral fitness in HOFIs and Culex tarsalis, and the temperature-sensitive phenotype of COAV997 did not affect replication in HOFIs as none of the infected birds became febrile. The NY99 and CA-04 isolates demonstrated elevated fitness in HOFIs compared to COAV997-5nt, whereas all viruses replicated to similar titers and RNA copies in Culex tarsalis, and the only fitness differences were related to infection rates. Our data demonstrated that competitive replication allows for the sensitive comparison of fitness differences among two genetically closely related viruses using relevant hosts of WNV while eliminating host-to-host differences. In conclusion, our approach may be helpful in understanding the extent of phenotypic change in fitness associated with genetic changes in WNV.","2015",NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0125668","WOS:000354543500024"

If ecology is to be incorporated into models of population genetics, then it is important to represent accurately the functional form of frequency-dependent interactions. However, measuring this functional form is problematic for traditional fitness assays, which assume a constant fitness difference between competitors over the course of an assay. Here, we present a theoretical framework for measuring the functional form of frequency-dependent fitness by accounting for changes in abundance and relative fitness during a competition assay. Using two examples of ecological coexistence that arose in a long-term evolution experiment with Escherichia coli, we illustrate accurate quantification of the functional form of frequency-dependent relative fitness. Using a Monod-type model of growth dynamics, we show that two ecotypes in a typical cross-feeding interactionsuch as when one bacterial population uses a byproduct generated by anotheryields relative fitness that is linear with relative frequency.","2015",NA,"10.1111/evo.12645","WOS:000354561600016"

Toxin secretion is central to the biology of many bacterial pathogens and is widely accepted as playing a crucial role in disease pathology. To understand the relationship between toxicity and bacterial virulence in greater depth, we studied two sequenced collections of the major human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus and found an unexpected inverse correlation between bacterial toxicity and disease severity. By applying a functional genomics approach, we identified several novel toxicity-affecting loci responsible for the wide range in toxic phenotypes observed within these collections. To understand the apparent higher propensity of low toxicity isolates to cause bacteraemia, we performed several functional assays, and our findings suggest that within-host fitness differences between high- and low-toxicity isolates in human serum is a contributing factor. As invasive infections, such as bacteraemia, limit the opportunities for onward transmission, highly toxic strains could gain an additional between-host fitness advantage, potentially contributing to the maintenance of toxicity at the population level.

"Wiser, MJ; Lenski, RE","A Comparison of Methods to Measure Fitness in Escherichia coli","PLOS ONE","In order to characterize the dynamics of adaptation, it is important to be able to quantify how a population's mean fitness changes over time. Such measurements are especially important in experimental studies of evolution using microbes. The Long-Term Evolution Experiment (LTEE) with Escherichia coli provides one such system in which mean fitness has been measured by competing derived and ancestral populations. The traditional method used to measure fitness in the LTEE and many similar experiments, though, is subject to a potential limitation. As the relative fitness of the two competitors diverges, the measurement error increases because the less-fit population becomes increasingly small and cannot be enumerated as precisely. Here, we present and employ two alternatives to the traditional method. One is based on reducing the fitness differential between the competitors by using a common reference competitor from an intermediate generation that has intermediate fitness; the other alternative increases the initial population size of the less-fit, ancestral competitor. We performed a total of 480 competitions to compare the statistical properties of estimates obtained using these alternative methods with those obtained using the traditional method for samples taken over 50,000 generations from one of the LTEE populations. On balance, neither alternative method yielded measurements that were more precise than the traditional method.","2015",NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0126210","WOS:000354542500074"

Here we propose a probabilistic framework for codon substitution that evaluates joint effects of relative solvent accessibility (RSA), a structural constraint; and gene expression, a functional constraint. First, we explore the relationship between RSA and codon usage at the genomic scale as well as at the individual gene scale. Motivated by these results, we construct our framework by determining how probable is an amino acid, given RSA and gene expression, and then evaluating the relative probability of observing a codon compared to other synonymous codons. We come to the biologically plausible conclusion that both RSA and gene expression are related to amino acid frequencies, but, among synonymous codons, the relative probability of a particular codon is more closely related to gene expression than RSA. To illustrate the potential applications of our framework, we propose a new codon substitution model. Using this model, we obtain estimates of 2Ns, the product of effective population size N, and relative fitness difference of allele s. For a training data set consisting of human proteins with known structures and expression data, 2N s is estimated separately for synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions in each protein. We then contrast the patterns of synonymous and nonsynonymous 2N s estimates across proteins while also taking gene expression levels of the proteins into account. We conclude that our 2N s estimates are too concentrated around 0, and we discuss potential explanations for this lack of variability.","2015",NA,"10.4137/EBO.S22911","WOS:000353640700001"

To understand the contribution of MHC polymorphism to individual disease resistance or susceptibility in natural populations, we investigated two MHC class II B loci, DQB and DRB, in the New Zealand sea lion (NZSL, Phocarctos hookeri). The NZSL is a threatened species which is unusually susceptible to death by bacterial infection at an early age; it has suffered three bacterial induced epizootics resulting in high mortality levels of young pups since 1997. The MHC DQB and DRB haplotypes of dead NZSL pups with known cause of death (bacteria, enteritis or trauma) were sequenced and reconstructed, compared to pups that survived beyond 2months of age, and distinct MHC DRB allele frequency and genotype differences were identified. Two findings were striking: (i) one DRB allele was present only in dead pups, and (ii) one heterozygous DRB genotype, common in live pups, was absent from dead pups. These results are consistent with some functional relationship with these variants and suggest heterozygote advantage is operating at DRB. We found no association between heterozygosity and fitness at 17 microsatellite loci, indicating that general heterozygosity is not responsible for the effect on fitness detected here. This result may be a consequence of recurrent selection by multiple pathogen assault over recent years and highlights the importance of heterozygote advantage at MHC as a potential mechanism for fitness differences in wild populations.","2015",NA,"10.1111/mec.13128","WOS:000351631500003"

These mechanisms have mostly been studied in synthetic grass populations. If we are to improve our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of such symbioses, we now need to determine the combinations of mechanisms actually operating in the wild, in populations shaped by evolutionary history. We used a demographic population modeling approach to identify the mechanisms operating in a natural stand of an intermediate population (i.e. 50% of plants symbiotic) of the native grass Festuca eskia. We recorded demographic data in the wild over a period of three years, with manipulation of the soil resources for half the population. We developed two stage-structured matrix population models. The first model concerned either symbiotic or non-symbiotic plants. The second model included both symbiotic and non-symbiotic plants and took endophyte transmission rates into account. According to our models, symbiotic had a significantly higher population growth rate than non-symbiotic plants, and endophyte prevalence was about 58%. Endophyte transmission rates were about 0.67 or 0.87, depending on the growth stage considered. In the presence of nutrient supplementation, population growth rates were still significantly higher for symbiotic than for non-symbiotic plants, but endophyte prevalence fell to 0%. At vertical transmission rates below 0.10-0.20, no symbiosis was observed. Our models showed that a positive benefit of the endophyte and vertical transmission rates of about 0.6 could lead to the coexistence of symbiotic and non-symbiotic F. eskia plants. The positive effect of the symbiont on host is not systematically associated with high transmission rates of the symbiont over short time scales, in particular following an environmental change.","2015",NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0139919","WOS:000362962300036"

Mathematical models indicate that niche differences between ploidy phases may be a necessary condition for the evolution and maintenance of these life cycles. Nevertheless, experimental support for this prediction remains elusive. In the present work, we explored this hypothesis in natural populations of the brown alga Ectocarpus. Consistent with the life cycle described in culture, Ectocarpus crouaniorum in NW France and E. siliculosus in SW Italy exhibited an alternation between haploid gametophytes and diploid sporophytes. Our field data invalidated, however, the long-standing view of an isomorphic alternation of generations. Gametophytes and sporophytes displayed marked differences in size and, conforming to theoretical predictions, occupied different spatiotemporal niches. Gametophytes were found almost exclusively on the alga Scytosiphon lomentaria during spring whereas sporophytes were present year-round on abiotic substrata. Paradoxically, E. siliculosus in NW France exhibited similar habitat usage despite the absence of alternation of ploidy phases. Diploid sporophytes grew both epilithically and epiphytically, and this mainly asexual population gained the same ecological advantage postulated for haploid-diploid populations. Consequently, an ecological interpretation of the niche differences between haploid and diploid individuals does not seem to satisfactorily explain the evolution of the Ectocarpus life cycle.","2015",NA,"10.1111/evo.12702","WOS:000358503800013"

Decades of theory and recent empirical results have shown that evolutionary, population, community and ecosystem properties are the result of feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary processes. The vast majority of theory and empirical research on these eco-evolutionary feedbacks has focused on interactions among population size and mean traits of populations. 2. However, numbers and mean traits represent only a fraction of the possible feedback dimensions. Populations of many organisms consist of different size classes that differ in their impact on the environment and each other. Moreover, rarely do we know the map of ecological pathways through which changes in numbers or size structure cause evolutionary change. The goal of this study was to test the role of size structure in eco-evolutionary feedbacks of Trinidadian guppies and to begin to build an eco-evolutionary map along this unexplored dimension. 3. We used a factorial experiment in mesocosms wherein we crossed high-and low-predation guppy phenotypes with population size structure. We tested the ability of changes in size structure to generate selection on the demographic rates of guppies using an integral projection model (IPM). To understand how fitness differences among high-and low-predation phenotypes may be generated, we measured the response of the biomass of lower trophic levels and nutrient cycling to the different phenotype and size structure treatments. 4. We found a significant interaction between guppy phenotype and the size structure treatments for absolute fitness. Size structure had a very large effect on invertebrate biomass in the mesocosms, but there was little or no effect of the phenotype. The effect of size structure on algal biomass depended on guppy phenotype, with no difference in algal biomass in populations with more, smaller guppies, but a large decrease in algal biomass in mesocosms with phenotypes adapted to low-predation risk. 5. These results indicate an important role for size structure partially driving eco-evolutionary feedbacks in guppies. The changes in the ecosystem suggest that the absence of a steep decline in guppy fitness of the low-predation risk populations is likely due to higher consumption of algae when invertebrates are comparatively rare. Overall, these results demonstrate size structure as a possible dimension through which eco-evolutionary feedbacks may occur in natural populations.","2015",NA,"10.1111/1365-2656.12353","WOS:000357813500008"

Using Sonoran Desert top soils from between and under shrubs within a long-term N-enrichment experiment, we determined community concentration-response kinetics of AO and measured the total and relative abundance of AOA and AOB based on amoA gene abundance. As expected, N addition increased maximum AO rates and the abundance of bacterial amoA genes compared to the controls. Surprisingly, N addition also increased the abundance of archaeal amoA genes. We did not detect any major effects of N addition on ammonia-oxidizing community composition. The ammonia-oxidizing communities in these desert soils were dominated by AOA as expected (78% of amoA gene copies were related to Nitrososphaera), but contained unusually high contributions of Nitrosomonas (18%) and unusually low numbers of Nitrosospira (2%).

However, the effects of elevated CO2 and N on the (de)coupling between different microbial functional groups (e.g., different groups of nitrifiers) have been barely studied, despite potential consequences for ecosystem functioning. Here, we investigated the short-term combined effects of elevated CO2 and N supply on the abundances of the four main microbial groups involved in soil nitrification: ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (belonging to the genera Nitrobacter and Nitrospira) in grassland mesocosms. AOB and AOA abundances responded differently to the treatments: N addition increased AOB abundance, but did not alter AOA abundance. Nitrobacter and Nitrospira abundances also showed contrasted responses to the treatments: N addition increased Nitrobacter abundance, but decreased Nitrospira abundance. Our results support the idea of a niche differentiation between AOB and AOA, and between Nitrobacter and Nitrospira. AOB and Nitrobacter were both promoted at high N and C conditions (and low soil water content for Nitrobacter), while AOA and Nitrospira were favored at low N and C conditions (and high soil water content for Nitrospira). In addition, Nitrobacter abundance was positively correlated to AOB abundance and Nitrospira abundance to AOA abundance. Our results suggest that the couplings between ammonia and nitrite oxidizers are influenced by soil N availability. Multiple environmental changes may thus elicit rapid and contrasted responses between and among the soil ammonia and nitrite oxidizers due to their different ecological requirements.","2015",NA,"10.1007/s00248-015-0604-9","WOS:000361984700018"

Here we report the notable exception of a benthic marine community in the wake of the end-Permian mass extinction, which is associated with the microbial limestone facies of the earliest Triassic of South China. The newly reported fauna is well preserved and extraordinarily rich (30 benthic macroinvertebrate species, including the new species Astartella? stefaniae (Bivalvia) and Eucochlis obliquecostata (Gastropoda)) and stems from an environmentally stable setting providing favourable conditions for benthic organisms. Whereas changes in the taxonomic composition are negligible over the observed time interval of 10-100ka, three ecological stages are identified, in which relative abundances of initially rare species continuously increased at the cost of previously dominant species. Concomitant with the changes of dominant species is an increase in faunal evenness and heterogeneity. In the absence of both environmental and taxonomic changes, we attribute this pattern to the long-term effects of interspecific competition, which acted at an unusually slow pace because the number of competing species and potential immigrants was dramatically reduced by the end-Permian mass extinction. We suggest that these non-actualistic conditions led to decreased rates of niche differentiation and hence to the delayed rediversification of benthos that characterizes the aftermath of the greatest Phanerozoic mass extinction event. A hyperbolic diversification model is proposed, which accounts for the positive relationship between the intensity of interspecific competition and the rate of niche differentiation and resolves the conundrum of delayed rediversification at a time when niche space was largely vacated.","2015",NA,"10.1111/pala.12186","WOS:000360586100007"

The objective of this study was to analyse whether an increasing proportion of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria affects (i) the composition of the non-diazotrophic component of ambient phytoplankton communities and (ii) resource use efficiency (RUE; ratio of Chl a to total nutrients) - an important ecosystem function. We hypothesize that diazotrophs increase community P use and decrease N use efficiencies, as new N is brought into the system, relaxing N, and concomitantly aggravating P limitation. We test this by analysing an extensive data set from the Baltic Sea (>3700 quantitative phytoplankton samples), known to harbour conspicuous and recurrent blooms of Nodularia spumigena and Aphanizomenon sp. System-level phosphorus use efficiency (RUEP) was positively related to high proportion of diazotrophic cyanobacteria, suggesting aggravation of phosphorus limitation. However, concomitant decrease of nitrogen use efficiency (RUEN) was not observed. Nodularia spumigena, a dominant diazotroph and a notorious toxin producer, had a significantly stronger relationship with RUEP, compared to the competing non-toxic Aphanizomenon sp., confirming niche differentiation in P acquisition strategies between the major bloom-forming cyanobacterial species in the Baltic Sea. Nodularia occurrences were associated with stronger temperature stratification in more offshore environments, indicating higher reliance on insitu P regeneration. By using constrained and unconstrained ordination, permutational multivariate analysis of variance and local similarity analysis, we show that diazotrophic cyanobacteria explained no more than a few percentage of the ambient phytoplankton community variation. The analyses furthermore yielded rather evenly distributed negative and positive effects on individual co-occurring phytoplankton taxa, with no obvious phylogenetic or functional trait-based patterns.Synthesis. Our study reveals that despite the widely acknowledged noxious impacts of cyanobacterial blooms, the overall effect on phytoplankton community structure is minor. There are no predominantly positive or negative associations with ambient phytoplankton species. Species-specific niche differences in cyanobacterial resource acquisition affect important ecosystem functions, such as biomass production per unit limiting resource.","2015",NA,"10.1111/1365-2745.12437","WOS:000360216400006"

However, recent stable isotope analyses documented that collembolan species occupy different trophic levels, but detailed studies on species-specific food resources are sparse. Further, it still is little understood whether food resources of collembolan species are constant or shift, e.g., with habitats. Fatty acid (FA) and stable isotope analysis allow insight into utilisation of basal resources and trophic levels of consumers, respectively. We combined these methods to investigate variations in trophic niches of six collembolan species (Lepidocyrtus lanuginosus, Folsomia quadrioculata, Parisotoma notabilis, Ceratophysella denticulata, Isotomiella minor and Protaphorura arrnata) in beech and spruce forests. We correlated collembolan FAs with that of litter microorganisms at the respective study sites to identify links to resources. FA composition and stable isotope signatures in collembolan species did not differ significantly between forest types but between species suggesting pronounced trophic niche differentiation between species. The trophic niche of C denticulata and P. armata was similar and significantly differed from the other species with C-13 and N-15 signatures being least depleted. We suggest that C. denticulata has a predatory life style feeding on nematodes. Due to intermediate to low 13C and 15N levels and specific FA compositions the other collembolan species could be ascribed to secondary decomposers with I. minor being more closely associated with bacterial resources and E quadrioculata, L. lanuginosus and P. notabilis with fungal resources. However, dietary niches presumably comprise a mixture of resources rather than single resources. FAs in collembolan species correlated poorly with those in litter suggesting that the diet of collembolan species is rather independent of the structure of microbial communities in bulk litter. The results suggest that collembolans consume resources of microsites rather than bulk material thereby benefitting from the small-scale heterogeneity in resource distribution in soil.

It is commonly believed that functional traits (generalists versus specialists) involved in the exploitation of resources depend on resource availability and environmental fluctuations. The longitudinal nature of stream ecosystems provides changing resources to stream biota with yet unknown effects on microbial functional traits and community structure. We investigated the impact of autochthonous (algal extract) and allochthonous (spruce extract) resources, as they change along alpine streams from above to below the treeline, on microbial diversity, community composition and functions of benthic biofilms. Combining bromodeoxyuridine labelling and 454 pyrosequencing, we showed that diversity was lower upstream than downstream of the treeline and that community composition changed along the altitudinal gradient. We also found that, especially for allochthonous resources, specialisation by biofilm bacteria increased along that same gradient. Our results suggest that in streams below the treeline biofilm diversity, specialisation and functioning are associated with increasing niche differentiation as potentially modulated by divers allochthonous and autochthonous constituents contributing to resources. These findings expand our current understanding on biofilm structure and function in alpine streams.","2015",NA,"10.1038/ismej.2015.56","WOS:000365091700012"

To this end, a two-dimensional model combining mechanisms of immigration, dispersal, and niche differentiation was first established to describe the effects of hydrodynamics on bacterial communities within fluvial biofilms. Deterministic factors of the model were identified via the calculation of Spearman's rank correlation coefficients between parameters of hydrodynamics and the bacterial community. It was found that turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent intensity were considered as a set of reasonable predictors of community composition, whereas flow velocity and turbulent intensity can be combined together to predict biofilm bacterial biomass. According to the modeling result, the bacterial community could get its favorable assembly condition with a flow velocity ranging from 0.041 to 0.061 m/s. However, the driving force for biofilm community assembly changed with the local hydrodynamics. Individuals reproduction within the biofilm was the main driving force with flow velocity less than 0.05 m/s, while cell migration played a much more important role with velocity larger than 0.05 m/s. The developed model could be considered as a useful tool for improving the technologies of water environment protection and remediation.","2015",NA,"10.1021/acs.est.5b03277","WOS:000364355300031"

We use a long-term soil chronosequence that includes ecosystem progression and retrogression to quantify the importance of host plant identity as a factor driving fungal community composition during ecosystem development. We identified arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and plant species from 50 individual roots from each of 10 sites spanning 5-120000yr of ecosystem age using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), Sanger sequencing and pyrosequencing. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities were highly structured by ecosystem age. There was strong niche differentiation, with different groups of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) being characteristic of early succession, ecosystem progression and ecosystem retrogression. Fungal alpha diversity decreased with ecosystem age, whereas beta diversity was high at early stages and lower in subsequent stages. A total of 39% of the variance in fungal communities was explained by host plant and site age, 29% of which was attributed to host and the interaction between host and site (24% and 5%, respectively). The strong response of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to ecosystem development appears to be largely driven by plant host identity, supporting the concept that plant and fungal communities are tightly coupled rather than independently responding to habitat.","2015",NA,"10.1111/nph.13226","WOS:000349386300026"

We present here the first study assessesing the impact of Ailanthus altissima on soil and litter invertebrate communities in a temperate forest. We analyzed the effect of varying Ailanthus altissima densities in a forest of north-eastern France on soil microbial activity, diversity of various litter and soil invertebrate groups (Arthropoda, Lumbricidae, Gastropoda), diversity of functional groups (predatory, detritivorous, coprophagous, phytophagous), and trophic structure. Our study shows that increasing density of Ailanthus altissima is associated to lower soil microbial activity, decreasing abundance of litter detritivores (Acari and Collembola) and aboveground predatory Coleoptera, and decreasing species richness of terrestrial Gastropoda. In contrast, increased Ailanthus altissima density corresponded with greater abundances of litter Lumbricidae and aboveground coprophagous Coleoptera.

In this study, we evaluated the impact of harvesting Phragmites australis (Cav.)

The nitrifiers were targeted using bacterial and archaeal-amoA that encode ammonia monooxygenase, and the denitrifiers were targeted using nirK and nirS that encode the nitrite reductase. The community structures were evaluated using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The potential nitrification and nitrate reduction rates were shown to be significantly higher in the harvested plant rhizosphere than in a non-harvested control plot. The potential nitrification rate positively correlated with the potential nitrate reduction rate and influenced the community structure of nirK. In addition, plant canopy developed differently after harvest and simultaneously changed the microclimate beneath the plant community. These results suggest that plant harvest management could change subsequent plant development and associated microenvironments, thereby affecting the function and community structure of nitrifiers and denitrifiers.

Furthermore, their physical stability coupled with vertical water column partitioning makes them important research model systems in microbial niche differentiation and biogeochemical cycling. Here, we compare the prokaryotic assemblages from Ursu and Fara Fund hypersaline meromictic lakes (Transylvanian Basin, Romania) in relation to their limnological factors and infer their role in elemental cycling by matching taxa to known taxon-specific biogeochemical functions. To assess the composition and structure of prokaryotic communities and the environmental factors that structure them, deep-coverage small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA (rDNA) amplicon sequencing, community domain-specific quantitative PCR and physicochemical analyses were performed on samples collected along depth profiles. The analyses showed that the lakes harbored multiple and diverse prokaryotic communities whose distribution mirrored the water stratification patterns. Ursu Lake was found to be dominated by Bacteria and to have a greater prokaryotic diversity than Fara Fund Lake that harbored an increased cell density and was populated mostly by Archaea within oxic strata. In spite of their contrasting diversity, the microbial populations indigenous to each lake pointed to similar physiological functions within carbon degradation and sulfate reduction. Furthermore, the taxonomy results coupled with methane detection and its stable C isotope composition indicated the presence of a yet-undescribed methanogenic group in the lakes' hypersaline monimolimnion. In addition, ultrasmall uncultivated archaeal lineages were detected in the chemocline of Fara Fund Lake, where the recently proposed Nanohaloarchaeota phylum was found to thrive.","2015",NA,"10.1038/ismej.2015.60","WOS:000365094400009"
"Buscot, F","Implication of evolution and diversity in arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal symbioses","JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY","Being highly sensitive to ecological variations, symbiotic associations should inherently have a limited occurrence in nature. To circumvent this sensitivity and reach their universal distribution, symbioses used three strategies during their evolution, which all generated high biodiversity levels: (i) specialization to a specific environment, (ii) protection of one partner via its internalization into the other, (iii) frequent partner exchange. Mycorrhizal associations follow the 3rd strategy, but also present traits of internalization. As most ancient type, arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) formed by a monophyletic fungal group with reduced species richness did constantly support the mineral nutrition of terrestrial plants and enabled their ecological radiation and actual biodiversity level. In contrast ectomycorrhiza (EM) evolved later and independently within different taxa of fungi able to degrade complex organic plant residues, and the diversity levels of EM fungal and tree partners are balanced. Despite their different origins and diversity levels, AM and EM fungi display similar patterns of diversity dynamics in ecosystems. At each time or succession interval, a few dominant and many rare fungi are recruited by plants roots from a wide reservoir of propagules. However, the dominant fungal partners are frequently replaced in relation to changes in the vegetation or ecological conditions. While the initial establishment of AM and EM fungal communities corresponds to a neutral recruitment, their further succession is rather driven by niche differentiation dynamics.

Identifying the spatial distribution of microorganisms with mat depth facilitates a greater understanding of specific niches and potentially novel microbial interactions. High throughput sequencing coupled with elemental analyses and biogeochemical measurements of two distinct mat types (smooth and pustular) at a millimeter scale were undertaken in the present study. A total of 8,263,982 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained, which were affiliated to 58 bacterial and candidate phyla. The surface of both mats were dominated by Cyanobacteria, accompanied with known or putative members of Alphaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. The deeper anoxic layers of smooth mats were dominated by Chloroflexi, while Alphaproteobacteria dominated the lower layers of pustular mats. In situ microelectrode measurements revealed smooth mats have a steeper profile of O-2 and H2S concentrations, as well as higher oxygen production, consumption, and sulfate reduction rates. Specific elements (Mo, Mg, Mn, Fe, V, P) could be correlated with specific mat types and putative phylogenetic groups. Models are proposed for these systems suggesting putative surface anoxic niches, differential nitrogen fixing niches, and those coupled with methane metabolism.","2015",NA,"10.1038/srep15607","WOS:000363407000001"

However, the nature of spatiotemporal patterns documented and subsequent interpretation of ecological processes can vary significantly from study to study. In order to look for general patterns we synthesize the available data across different sampling scales and mycorrhizal types. The results of this analysis shed light on the relative importance of space, time and vertical soil structure on community variability across different mycorrhizal types. Although we found no significant trend in spatiotemporal variation among mycorrhizal types, the vertical community variation was distinctly greater than the spatial and temporal variability in mycorrhizal fungal communities. Both spatial and temporal variability of communities was greater in topsoil compared with lower horizons, suggesting that greater environmental heterogeneity drives community variation on a fine scale.

A culture-based presence-absence test confirmed the presence of viable nitrifiers. AOB were usually present in similar or greater numbers than AOA in both systems. As well, AOB showed higher regrowth potential compared with AOA in both systems. Statistically significant correlations were measured between several water quality parameters of relevance to nitrification. Total chlorine was negatively correlated with both nitrifiers and heterotrophic plate count (HPC) bacteria, and ammonia levels were positively correlated with nitrifiers.

Soil net nitrification rates were significantly higher in OM soils than in CK, N or NPK soils. Quantitative analysis of the distribution of amoA genes by DNA-based stable isotope probing revealed that AOA dominate in CK, N and NPK soils, while AOB dominate in OM soils.

The physical and chemical properties of their nest structures have been largely described; however less information is available concerning the relatively temporary structures made above-ground to access food items and protect the foraging space (the soil 'sheetings'). This study investigated whether the soil physical and chemical properties of these constructions are constant or if they vary depending on the type of food they cover. Soil samples and soil sheetings were collected in a forest in India, from leaves on the ground (LEAF), fallen branches (WOOD), and vertical soil sheetings covering the bark of trees (TREE). In this environment, termite diversity was dominated by Odontotermes species, and especially Odontotermes feae and Odontotermes obesus. However, there was no clear niche differentiation and, for example, O. feae termites were found on all the materials. Compared with the putative parent soil (control), TREE sheetings showed the greatest (and most significant) differences (higher clay content and smaller clay particle sizes, lower C and N content and smaller delta C-13 and delta N-15), while LEAF sheetings were the least modified, though still significantly different than the control soil. We suggest that the termite diversity is a less important driver of potential soil modification than sheeting diversity. Further, there is evidence that construction properties are adapted to their prospective life-span, with relatively long-lasting structures being most different from the parent soil.

It is unknown what influences the population structuring of these chemotypes. Sediment cores from seven lakes in southern Norway allowed temporal reconstruction of chemotype diversity from sites where there is only fragmented historical information. Sediment DNA was amplified using primers designed to specify the chemotype variations found within the cyanopeptoline ociB gene cluster. Findings indicate that of the seven lakes studied, only two lakes had Planktothrix populations containing all four of the most common Norwegian chemotypes. We used principal component analysis and Kendall tau analysis to investigate the ability of monitoring data to predict chemotype diversity, and to identify possible biotic or abiotic barriers to chemotype dispersal. The best predictor was a negative relationship between number of chemotypes present in a lake and the concentration of chlorophyll a in the top 0-4 m. At low chlorophyll a concentrations, light penetration is typically deeper, which could allow light tolerant Planktothrix to move deeper into the colder waters. Recent research findings have suggested this allows for a window of opportunity for Planktothrix to escape parasitism. With this added cold, light-constrained niche, more chemotypes might find refuge. The resulting increase in chemotype diversity within Planktothrix populations could present a greater defense against parasitism when conditions varied, such as by seasonal light changes.","2015",NA,"10.3389/fevo.2015.00104","WOS:000485318800112"

However, it remains unclear whether niche specialization of AOA and AOB occurs in rice paddy wetlands constrained by oxygen availability. Using DNA-based stable isotope probing, we conclude that AOA dominated nitrification activity in acidic paddy soils (pH 5.6) while AOB dominated in alkaline soils (pH 8.2). Nitrification activity was stimulated by urea fertilization and accompanied by a significant increase of AOA in acid soils and AOB in alkaline soils. DNA-based stable isotope probing indicated significant assimilation of (CO2)-C-13 for AOA only in acidic paddy soil, while AOB was the solely responsible for ammonia oxidation in the alkaline paddy soil. Phylogenetic analysis further indicated that AOA members within the soil group 1.1b lineage dominated nitrification in acid soils. Ammonia oxidation in the alkaline soil was catalyzed by Nitrosospira cluster 3-like AOB, suggesting that the physiological diversity of AOA is more complicated than previously thought, and soil pH plays important roles in shaping the community structures of ammonia oxidizers in paddy field.

Additionally, the nitrification inhibitor allylthiourea (ATU) was applied to discriminate between archaeal and bacterial contributions to soil ammonia oxidation. Thaumarchaeota, which were the only ammonia oxidizers detectable at the start of the incubation, grew in all microcosms, but AOB later became detectable in ammonium amended microcosms. Low and high additions of ammonium increasingly stimulated AOB growth, while AOA were only stimulated by the low addition. Treatment with ATU had no effect on net nitrification and sizes of ammonia-oxidizing communities suggesting that the effective concentration of ATU to discriminate between archaeal and bacterial ammonia oxidation is not the same in different soils.

The influence of plant richness was mainly due to its indirect influence on T-GRSP and EMH. There was a strong positive correlation between GRSP and soil total carbon and nitrogen. Our results indicate that mycorrhization might not be a major trait leading to niche differentiation of the two co-occurring sedge species. However, AMF contribute to soil aggregation and thus may have the potential to greatly influence C and N cycling in alpine grasslands.","2015",NA,"10.1111/1462-2920.12792","WOS:000360048800021"

However, how fertilization regimes impact denitrification and its related bacterial community in this soil type is still unclear. Here, taking advantage of a suit of molecular ecological tools in combination of assaying the potential denitrification (DP), we explored the variation of activity, community structure, and abundance of nirS and nirK denitrifiers under four different fertilization regimes, namely no fertilization control (N0M0), organic pig manure (N0M1), inorganic fertilization (N1M0), and combination of inorganic fertilizer and pig manure (N1M1). The results indicated that organic fertilization increased DP, but inorganic fertilization had no impacts. The increase of DP was mirrored by the shift of nirS denitrifiers' community structure but not by that of nirK denitrifiers'. Furthermore, the change of DP coincided with the variation of abundances of both denitrifiers. Shifts of community structure and abundance of nirS and nirK denitrifiers were correlated with the change of soil pH, total nitrogen (TN), organic matter (OM), C:P, total phosphorus (TP), and available phosphorus (Olsen P). Our results suggest that the change of DP under these four fertilization regimes was closely related to the shift of denitrifying bacteria communities resulting from the variation of properties in the black soil tested.","2015",NA,"10.1007/s00253-015-6461-0","WOS:000356805600032"

In this study we investigated the interactions between the unicellular N-2-fixing cyanobacterium Cyanothece sp. Miami BG043511 and its associated free-living chemotrophic bacteria at different concentrations of nitrate and dissolved organic carbon and different temperatures. High temperature strongly stimulated the growth of Cyanothece, but had less effect on the growth and community composition of the chemotrophic bacteria. Conversely, nitrate and carbon addition did not significantly increase the abundance of Cyanothece, but strongly affected the abundance and species composition of the associated chemotrophic bacteria. In nitrate-free medium the associated bacterial community was co-dominated by the putative diazotroph Mesorhizobium and the putative aerobic anoxygenic phototroph Erythrobacter and after addition of organic carbon also by the Flavobacterium Muricauda. Addition of nitrate shifted the composition toward co-dominance by Erythrobacter and the Gammaproteobacterium Marinobacter. Our results indicate that Cyanothece modified the species composition of its associated bacteria through a combination of competition and facilitation. Furthermore, within the bacterial community, niche differentiation appeared to play an important role, contributing to the coexistence of a variety of different functional groups. An important implication of these findings is that changes in nitrogen and carbon availability due to, e.g., eutrophication and climate change are likely to have a major impact on the species composition of the bacterial community associated with N-2-fixing cyanobacteria.","2015",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2014.00795","WOS:000348808900001"

The application of these digestates to soil as fertilizer has increased in recent years. Therefore, we herein compared the effects of applying wet digestates (pH 8.2, C/N ratio 4.5), dry digestates (pH 8.8, C/N ratio 23.4), and a chemical fertilizer to Japanese paddy and upland soils on short-term nitrification under laboratory aerobic conditions. Chloroform-labile C, an indicator of microbial biomass, was only minimally affected by these applications, indicating that a small amount of labile N was immobilized by microbes. All applications led to rapid increases in NO3-N contents in both soils, and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, but not archaea may play a critical role in net nitrification in the amended soils. The net nitrification rates for both soils were the highest after the application of dry digestates, followed by wet digestates and then the chemical fertilizer in order of decreasing soil pH. These results suggest that the immediate effects of applying digestates, especially dry digestates with the highest pH, on nitrate leaching need to be considered when digestates are used as alternative fertilizers.","2015",NA,"10.1264/jsme2.ME14080","WOS:000351925200005"

Mounting evidence has confirmed the functional importance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) in soil nitrification, but little is known about their biogeographic distribution patterns in paddy ecosystems. Here, we used barcoded pyrosequencing to characterize the effects of climatic, geochemical and spatial factors on the distribution of ammonia oxidizers from 11 representative rice-growing regions (75-1945 km apart) of China. Potential nitrification rates varied greatly by more than three orders of magnitude, and were significantly correlated with the abundances of AOA and AOB. The community composition of ammonia oxidizer was affected by multiple factors, but changes in relative abundances of the major lineages could be best predicted by soil pH. The alpha diversity of AOA and AOB displayed contrasting trends over the gradients of latitude and atmospheric temperature, indicating a possible niche separation between AOA and AOB along the latitude. The Bray-Curtis dissimilarities in ammonia-oxidizing community structure significantly increased with increasing geographical distance, indicating that more geographically distant paddy fields tend to harbor more dissimilar ammonia oxidizers. Variation partitioning analysis revealed that spatial, geochemical and climatic factors could jointly explain majority of the data variation, and were important drivers defining the ecological niches of AOA and AOB. Our findings suggest that both AOA and AOB are of functional importance in paddy soil nitrification, and ammonia oxidizers in paddy ecosystems exhibit large-scale biogeographic patterns shaped by soil pH, geographic distance, and climatic factors.","2015",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2015.00938","WOS:000360627900001"

Here, the effect of human settlement on the AOA and AOB diversity and abundance have been assessed by phylogenetic and quantitative PCR analyses, using archaeal and bacterial amoA and 16S rRNA genes. Overall, each environment contained specific clades of amoA and 16S rRNA genes sequences, suggesting that selective pressures lead to AOA and AOB inhabiting distinct ecological niches. Human settlement activities, as derived from increased metal and mineral nitrogen contents, appear to cause a response among the AOB community, with Nitrosomonas taking advantage over Nitrosospira in impacted environments. We also observed a dominance of AOB over AOA in mining-impacted sediments, suggesting that AOB might be the primary drivers of ammonia oxidation in these sediments. In addition, ammonia concentrations demonstrated to be the driver for the abundance of AOA, with an inversely proportional correlation between them. Our findings also revealed the presence of novel ecotypes of Thaumarchaeota, such as those related to the obligate acidophilic Nitrosotalea devanaterra at ammonia-rich places of circumneutral pH.

Focusing on decomposer (Oribatida) and predatory mites (Mesostigmata) we investigated the incorporation of resources from leaf litter rich (European beech, Fagus sylvatica) and poor (European ash, Fraxinus excelsior) in structural compounds using stable isotopes. Using litter mixtures we investigated if soil mites preferentially incorporate carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) derived from beech or ash leaf litter. Using the rotated-core method we established treatments with and without mycorrhiza as interactions between mycorrhiza and saprotrophic microorganisms may alter the availability of litter resources to soil invertebrates. Conform to our expectations primary decomposers incorporated more C and N than secondary decomposers or predators, but the contribution to body tissue element concentration was low suggesting that they predominantly rely on other resources than litter from the previous year. Generally, soil mites incorporated more C and N from ash than from beech litter, but this was less pronounced after 10 as compared to after 5 months, presumably due to fast decomposition of ash litter. In contrast to our expectations the use of litter resources by soil mites was little affected by mycorrhiza. Overall, the results underline that, at least during the first year of litter decay, leaf litter resources are of minor importance for soil mite nutrition, and this is particularly true for litter rich in structural compounds such as beech.

To date, little is known about their diversity and ecological niche partitioning within complex communities. In this study, the fine-scale community structure and function of Nitrospira was analyzed in two full-scale WWTPs as model ecosystems. In Nitrospira-specific 16S rRNA clone libraries retrieved from each plant, closely related phylogenetic clusters (16S rRNA identities between clusters ranged from 95.8% to 99.6%) within Nitrospira lineages I and II were found. Newly designed probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) allowed the specific detection of several of these clusters, whose coexistence in the WWTPs was shown for prolonged periods of several years. In situ ecophysiological analyses based on FISH, relative abundance and spatial arrangement quantification, as well as microautoradiography revealed functional differences of these Nitrospira clusters regarding the preferred nitrite concentration, the utilization of formate as substrate and the spatial coaggregation with ammonia-oxidizing bacteria as symbiotic partners. Amplicon pyrosequencing of the nxrB gene, which encodes subunit beta of nitrite oxidoreductase of Nitrospira, revealed in one of the WWTPs as many as 121 species-level nxrB operational taxonomic units with highly uneven relative abundances in the amplicon library.

Mathematical models function as tools to capture the complexity of these biological systems, but kinetic parameters especially of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) are lacking because of a limited number of pure cultures until recently. In this study, we compared the nitrite oxidation kinetics of six pure cultures and one enrichment culture representing three genera of NOB (Nitrobacter, Nitrospira, Nitrotoga). With half-saturation constants (K-m) between 9 and 27 mu M nitrite, Nitrospira bacteria are adapted to live under significant substrate limitation. Nitrobacter showed a wide range of lower substrate affinities, with K-m values between 49 and 544 mu M nitrite. However, the advantage of Nitrobacter emerged under excess nitrite supply, sustaining high maximum specific activities (V-max) of 64 to 164 mu mol nitrite/mg protein/h, contrary to the lower activities of Nitrospira of 18 to 48 mu mol nitrite/mg protein/h. The V-max (26 mu mol nitrite/mg protein/h) and K-m (58 mu M nitrite) of Candidatus Nitrotoga arctica measured at a low temperature of 17 degrees C suggest that Nitrotoga can advantageously compete with other NOB, especially in cold habitats.

Fluxes of HONO from agricultural and urban soil were suppressed by addition of a nitrification inhibitor and enhanced by amendment with ammonium (NH4+), with peaks at 19 and 8 ng m(-2) s(-1), respectively. In addition, both agricultural and urban soils were observed to convert (NH4+)-N-15 to (HONO)-N-15. Genomic surveys of soil samples revealed that 1.5-6% of total expressed 16S rRNA sequences detected belonged to known ammonia oxidizing bacteria and archaea. Peak fluxes of HONO were directly related to the abundance of ammonia-oxidizer sequences, which in turn depended on soil pH. Peak HONO fluxes under fertilized conditions are comparable in magnitude to fluxes reported during field campaigns.

It is of eminent importance as habitat for a variety of animal species but its importance for microarthropods, a diverse group of small forest animals, has been little studied. We investigated how oribatid mite density, species richness, community structure and the proportion of parthenogenetic individuals on the bark of dead wood are affected by log type (beech, oak) and surrounding forest type (deciduous, coniferous) in three regions in Germany (Schorfheide-Chorin, Hainich-Dun, Schwabische Alb). Additionally, we analyzed the trophic structure of oribatid mites from the bark of dead wood in one region (Hainich-Dun) using stable isotope ratios (N-15/N-14, C-13/C-12). Oribatid mite richness and community structure were significantly affected by log type, forest type and region. Oribatid mite communities comprised mainly soil and arboreal species but only few dead wood specialists indicating that dead wood in an early stage of decay functions as transitory habitat rather than specific microhabitat. However, some oribatid mites likely are adapted to dead wood as habitat by living phoretically on bark beetles (e.g., Siculobata leontonycha) or endophagous in fungi associated with dead wood (e.g., juvenile Carabodes species). The proportion of parthenogenetic oribatid mite individuals was rather low (similar to 8%) suggesting that oribatid mites on dead wood predominantly rely on living food resources resembling arboreal communities but not those in soil. Natural variations in stable isotope ratios indicate that oribatid mites on the bark of dead wood span at least three trophic levels including lichen feeders, moss feeders, decomposers and fungal feeders with fungal feeders dominating.

In this study, we provide molecular evidence for distinctly different phylotypes of nitrifying communities in a neutral paddy soil using high-throughput pyrosequencing and DNA-based stable isotope probing (SIP). Following urea addition, the levels of soil nitrate increased significantly, accompanied by an increase in the abundance of the bacterial and archaeal amoA gene in microcosms subjected to SIP (SIP microcosms) during a 56-day incubation period. High-throughput fingerprints of the total 16S rRNA genes in SIP microcosms indicated that nitrification activity positively correlated with the abundance of Nitrosospira-like ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), soil group 1.1b-like ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), and Nitrospira-like nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB). Pyrosequencing of C-13-labeled DNA further revealed that (CO2)-C-13 was assimilated by these functional groups to a much greater extent than by marine group 1.1a-associated AOA and Nitrobacter-like NOB. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that active AOB communities were closely affiliated with Nitrosospira sp. strain L115 and the Nitrosospira multiformis lineage and that the C-13-labeled AOA were related to phylogenetically distinct groups, including the moderately thermophilic Candidatus Nitrososphaera gargensis, uncultured fosmid 29i4, and acidophilic Candidatus Nitrosotalea devanaterra lineages.

Here, we use viromics to explore the Far-T4 phages sequence space, a neighbor clade from the well-studied T4-like phages that was first detected through PCR study in seawater and subsequently identified in freshwater lakes through 454-sequenced viromes. To advance the description of these viruses beyond this single marker gene, we explore Far-T4 genome fragments assembled from two deeply-sequenced freshwater viromes. Single gene phylogenetic trees confirm that the Far-T4 phages are divergent from the T4-like phages, genome fragments reveal largely collinear genome organizations, and both data led to the delineation of five Far 14 clades. Three-dimensional models of major capsid proteins are consistent with a 14-like structure, and highlight a highly conserved core flanked by variable insertions. Finally, we contextualize these now better characterized Far-T4 phages by re-analyzing 196 previously published viromes. These suggest that Far-T4 are common in freshwater and seawater as only four of 82 aquatic viromes lacked Far-T4-like sequences. Variability in representation across the five newly identified clades suggests clade-specific niche differentiation may be occurring across the different biomes, though the underlying mechanism remains unidentified.

While many of these microhabitats have been investigated intensively, the role of wood decaying fungi as a habitat and food resource for microarthropods found little attention. We investigated the density, community structure, reproductive mode and trophic structure of microarthropods, in particular oribatid mites, in the wood decaying fungus Fomitopsis pinicola (Schwarts: Fr) Karst. along an altitudinal gradient in Germany spanning from 350 m to 1160 m. Microarthropods were extracted from sporocarps, and stable isotope ratios (N-15/N-14; C-13/C-12) of the fungus and the microarthropods were measured. Densities of most microarthropod taxa were highest at lower altitudes and decreased with increasing altitude. Oribatid mites were the dominant animal taxon. Their community structure gradually changed with altitude. Stable isotope ratios indicated that oribatid mite and other arthropod species occupy distinct trophic niches but most do not feed on F. pinicola. Notably, species of the same genus, e.g. Carabodes, occupied different trophic niches. Most oribatid mite species in F. pinicola reproduced sexually which is similar to the bark of trees but in contrast to the soil where most species reproduce via parthenogenesis.

The results showed that the responses to increasing temperature and algal density for each of the life-table parameters differed with rotifer sibling species. Sibling species, temperature, algal density and their interactions almost all significantly affected the durations of juvenile period, embryonic development, reproductive period, post-reproductive period, mean lifespan, net reproductive rate, generation time and intrinsic rate of population growth. Sibling species significantly affected the age-specific survivorship. Temperature, algal density and their interaction and the interaction of sibling species and temperature significantly affected the age-specific fecundity. Regardless of the effects of temperature and algal density, the durations of juvenile period, embryonic development, reproductive period, post-reproductive period and mean lifespan, age-specific survivorship, net reproductive rate and generation time of the B. calyciflorus sibling species BNA13 were greater than those of BNB3, but the intrinsic rate of population growth of BNA13 was lower than those of BNB3.

"Jäger, CG; Diehl, S","Resource competition across habitat boundaries: asymmetric interactions between benthic and pelagic producers","ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS","In shallow aquatic systems, benthic and pelagic primary producers typically compete for light and nutrients along opposing vertical supply axes: pelagic algae shade the benthic habitat; conversely, benthic algae intercept the nutrient flux from the sediment to the pelagic habitat. We present a general framework for analyzing such spatially asymmetric resource competition across habitat boundaries using a mechanistic, dynamical model. We visualize the mechanisms determining the outcome of these cross-habitat interactions using zero-net-growth isoclines, resource supply points, and resource consumption vectors. In extensive invasion analyses, we characterize the abiotic and competitive persistence boundaries of pelagic and benthic primary producers, which are set by environmental factors determining nutrient and light supply and are modified by resource use by the competitor in the respective other habitat. We note several qualitative differences between cross-habitat and classical within-habitat resource competition. First, coexistence of cross-habitat competitors is facilitated by, but does not require niche differentiation with respect to, the utilization of resources. Because each species has a competitive edge for the resource that is supplied from its side of the system, a competitor that is inferior in utilizing both resources can sometimes coexist with, or even exclude, a superior competitor. Second, increasing the external supply of one resource (the nutrient) may initially favor both competitors, until a breakpoint is reached where the benthic producer goes abruptly extinct. Finally, whether a given pair of cross-habitat competitors coexist or shows alternative states may depend on the environment. Specifically, benthic and pelagic algae may coexist at low nutrient and light supply but produce alternative states at high nutrient and light supply. Alternative states are, in turn, promoted by any algal trait combination that increases the spatial asymmetry in resource consumption, i.e., leads to a higher nutrient consumption in the benthic habitat and/or a higher light consumption in the pelagic habitat. In a first empirical application, we show that predictions from our model give a good fit to published data on benthic and pelagic primary production in temperate and arctic lakes spanning a broad range of nutrient environments.","2014",NA,"10.1890/13-0613.1","WOS:000335859700005"

Isotopic niche width did not vary significantly between allopatric and sympatric populations of crayfish in the mesocosm experiments, and isotopic niche partitioning in all the wild populations suggests the invaders can coexist. All four species altered benthic invertebrate community structure but with differing functional effects, often mediated via trophic cascades. Red swamp crayfish predation upon snails evidently promoted benthic algal standing stock via reduction in grazing pressure. However, a trophic cascade whereby the crayfish consumed native invertebrate shredders, causing a reduction in net leaf litter decomposition, was decoupled by red swamp and signal crayfish since they consumed leaf litter directly and thus moderated the cascade to a trickle when in sympatry with Turkish or virile crayfish, respectively. Benthic invertebrate predator abundance was significantly reduced by sympatric red swamp and Turkish crayfish but not independently when in allopatry, indicating an amplified effect overall when in sympatry. Our results suggest that the combined effect of multiple invasions on the ecosystem can reflect either an additive effect of their independent impacts or an amplified effect, which is greater than the sum of their independent impacts. A lack of general pattern in their effects makes any potential management strategy more complex.","2014",NA,"10.1111/fwb.12333","WOS:000333964700002"

However, little is known about the extent to which the introduction of different crop compositions affects soil quality in general, and soil biota in particular. Recent studies have shown that epedaphic and euedaphic Collembola can have distinct differences in feeding strategy that suggests trophic niche differentiation according to soil habitat. Combining fatty acid (FA) biomarkers with the carbon isotopic ratios technique, we investigated belowground trophic interactions. We compared the FA composition of the three most predominant groups of Collembola (Isotoma spp., Lepidocyrtus cyaneus and Poduromorpha) and bulk soil in white clover-only, a grass-clover mixture, and grass-only plots. Differences between FA-delta C-13 of Collembola groups and the FA-delta C-13 signatures of potential food sources (plant material and soil microorganisms) were calculated to explore trophic links in the three cropping combinations. Collembola showed difference in FA compositions between groups. We observed a lower amount of neutral lipid fatty acids (NLFAs) in Isotoma spp. compared to L. cyaneus. Poduromorpha showed a higher relative percentage of the NLFAs 16:16)7 and 20:4 compared to L cyaneus, and of 18:3 compared to Isotoma spp. The NLFA oleic/ linoleic ratio (18:14 omega 9/18:26 omega 6,9) ratio was higher in Poduromorpha compared to L. cyaneus in all the treatments. Soil FA analysis highlighted a larger fungal/bacterial ratio in grass compared to clover plots, while in Collembola no differences in the FA pattern were detected in relation to the treatments. Nevertheless, results of delta C-13 fractionation in Collembola disclosed differences in the food sources used depending on the crop composition. Apparently, Isotoma spp. and L. cyaneus fed on clover-related diet in clover plots and more on grass-related diet in mixture treatments while Poduromorpha fed more on a plant-related diet, such as leaf litter, in the mixture treatment. Our results suggest differentiation in Collembola feeding strategy and in the diet in relation to food availability and palatability. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the accurate determination of the SCFA concentration in both fresh and stored sludge hydrolysates is important. To select a suitable method for monitoring SCFAs during the anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge, the accuracy of three available analytical methods, including 5 pH point acid titration (TITRA5), gas chromatography (GC), and spectrophotometry, were compared in the present study. The results revealed that TITRA5 and GC displayed better agreement in the achieved measurements and higher precision and accuracy than the spectrophotometric assay, as supported by the application of different statistical models. TITRA5 excelled in titrating unfiltered hydrolysate while simultaneously measuring the alkalinity, whereas the GC method provided detailed information on the contribution of different fatty acids to the total acidity. In contrast, the spectrophotometric assay suffered from many forms of interference, depending on the sample's matrix. SCFA production followed the pattern of enzymatic reactions and fitted the Michaelis-Menten model.

Zero N2O release was observed from the stored soils but the fresh soil samples had very low actual denitrification to N2O. NO3- addition significantly increased the amount of N2O (denitrification capacity to N2O) released after flooding, which depended on the length of storage and type of soils and was much higher in stored soils. Prolonged exposure of the soils to drought conditions caused a greater decrease in the Eh value compared with the fresh soil. The total cumulative release of N2O from the stored and fresh soils was correlated with the reduced NO3- and organic C content in soils enriched with NO3-. Some soils showed the capability of N2O consumption. CO2 release depended on the length of storage and type of soils under flooding after prolonged drought. On average, CO2 release was higher from the stored rather than fresh soils. The organic C content in the stored soils was generally lower than in the fresh soils, probably due to the storage effect.

Its spatial variability occurs within populations related to intertidal height and hydrodynamic stress, possibly reflecting the niche partitioning driven by their diverging adaptation to the environment argued necessary for their prevalence (evolutionary stability). Demographic models based in matrix algebra were developed to investigate which vital rates may efficiently generate an H:D variability at a fine spatial resolution. It was also taken into account time variation and type of life strategy. Ploidy dissimilarities in fecundity rates set an H:D spatial structure miss-fitting the ploidy fitness ratio. The same happened with ploidy dissimilarities in ramet growth whenever reproductive output dominated the population demography. Only through ploidy dissimilarities in looping rates (stasis, breakage and clonal growth) did the life cycle respond to a spatially heterogeneous environment efficiently creating a niche partition. Marginal locations were more sensitive than central locations. Related results have been obtained experimentally and numerically for widely different life cycles from the plant and animal kingdoms. Spore dispersal smoothed the effects of ploidy dissimilarities in fertility and enhanced the effects of ploidy dissimilarities looping rates. Ploidy dissimilarities in spore dispersal could also create the necessary niche partition, both over the space and time dimensions, even in spatial homogeneous environments and without the need for conditional differentiation of the ramets. Fine scale spatial variability may be the key for the prevalence of isomorphic biphasic life cycles, which has been neglected so far.","2014",NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0092602","WOS:000333355300103"

As a result, variation in fungal community composition can have important consequences for plant fitness. However, there are relatively few empirical data on how dispersal might affect fungal communities and the ecological processes they mediate. We established sampling stations across a large area of coastal landscape varying in their spatial proximity to each other and contrasting vegetation types. We measured dispersal of spores from a key group of fungi, the Basidomycota, across this landscape using qPCR and 454 pyrosequencing. We also measured the colonization of ectomycorrhizal fungi at each station using sterile bait seedlings. We found a high degree of spatial and temporal variability in the composition of Basidiomycota spores. This variability was in part stochastic and in part explained by spatial proximity to other vegetation types and time of year. Variation in spore community also affected colonization by ectomycorrhizal fungi and seedling growth. Our results demonstrate that fungal host and habitat specificity coupled with dispersal limitation can lead to local variation in fungal community structure and plant-fungal interactions.

Usually the stem is separated from the crown and used to produce material of different kind such as veneer, pallets, panels, etc. For wood industries,. crowns generally represent waste material to be disposed of, causing economic and time losses. It is generally believed that the costs of managing crown biomass are higher than the potential incomes obtainable. Nonetheless, it is worthwhile investigating the possibility of using these byproducts as energy source and evaluating their value as a fuel. However, storing such residues presents several problems connected with spontaneous microbial degradation. The aim of this work was to evaluate the storage effects on chipped biomass deriving from the crown and stem wood of poplar and how they affect fuel quality and dry matter losses. A storage trial was carried out with three piles of stem wood chips and three of crown chips coming from a 15 year old poplar plantation. The piles were stored outdoors for six months under the same climatic conditions. The effect of storage on fuel quality was evaluated with respect to moisture content, gross and net calorific values, chemical composition, ash content, and bulk density. The variation of temperatures inside each pile due to heat development was continuously monitored and showed different trends between piles depending on source material. Results showed that chips from crown material had better storage properties and exhibited lower decay than chips from stem wood. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite their scientific and public health significance, however, there remains much to be understood about the ecology and evolution of AIVs in wild birds, where major pools of genetic diversity are generated and maintained. Here, we present comparative phylodynamic analyses of human and AIVs in North America, demonstrating (i) significantly higher standing genetic diversity and (ii) phylogenetic trees with a weaker signature of immune escape in AIVs than in human viruses. To explain these differences, we performed statistical analyses to quantify the relative contribution of several potential explanations. We found that HA genetic diversity in avian viruses is determined by a combination of factors, predominantly subtype-specific differences in host immune selective pressure and the ecology of transmission (in particular, the durability of subtypes in aquatic environments). Extending this analysis using a computational model demonstrated that virus durability may lead to long-term, indirect chains of transmission that, when coupled with a short host lifespan, can generate and maintain the observed high levels of genetic diversity. Further evidence in support of this novel finding was found by demonstrating an association between subtype-specific environmental durability and predicted phylogenetic signatures: genetic diversity, variation in phylogenetic tree branch lengths, and tree height. The conclusion that environmental transmission plays an important role in the evolutionary biology of avian influenza viruses-a manifestation of the storage effect-highlights the potentially unpredictable impact of wildlife reservoirs for future human pandemics and the need for improved understanding of the natural ecology of these viruses.","2014",NA,"10.1371/journal.pbio.1001931","WOS:000341523000013"

Results: M1 and Fg limit GAS adherence and invasion of pharyngeal keratinocytes in vitro. Conclusion: Protease SpeB modulates M1 expression and GAS host cell interactions differentially during the course of infection. Significance: M1 protein is shown to impede pharyngeal colonization in vivo. Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a leading human pathogen producing a diverse array of infections from simple pharyngitis (strep throat) to invasive conditions, including necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome. The surface-anchored GAS M1 protein is a classical virulence factor that promotes phagocyte resistance and exaggerated inflammation by binding host fibrinogen (Fg) to form supramolecular networks. In this study, we used a virulent WT M1T1 GAS strain and its isogenic M1-deficient mutant to examine the role of M1-Fg binding in a proximal step in GAS infection-interaction with the pharyngeal epithelium. Expression of the M1 protein reduced GAS adherence to human pharyngeal keratinocytes by 2-fold, and this difference was increased to 4-fold in the presence of Fg. In stationary phase, surface M1 protein cleavage by the GAS cysteine protease SpeB eliminated Fg binding and relieved its inhibitory effect on GAS pharyngeal cell adherence. In a mouse model of GAS colonization of nasal-associated lymphoid tissue, M1 protein expression was associated with an average 6-fold decreased GAS recovery in isogenic strain competition assays. Thus, GAS M1 protein-Fg binding reduces GAS pharyngeal cell adherence and colonization in a fashion that is counterbalanced by SpeB. Inactivation of SpeB during the shift to invasive GAS disease allows M1-Fg binding, increasing pathogen phagocyte resistance and proinflammatory activities.","2014",NA,"10.1074/jbc.M113.529537","WOS:000331368700038"

Despite an increasing knowledge of post-invasion ecosystem changes, these modifications are only rarely studied within the temporal context of ongoing invasions. In this study we investigated 19 soil chemical and biological characteristics, as well as light conditions, in uninvaded grassland sites and compared them with those from sites invaded by giant hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum) for different times (from 11 to 48 years). We further related variation in these soil and light characteristics to richness and productivity of native plant species and hogweed cover measured in the field, and to common-garden performance of hogweed grown in soil inocula from the same sites. Hogweed presence significantly reduced red/far-red light ratios but increased soil pH. Longer invasion history was associated with increasing soil conductivity and content of extractable phosphorus. There were also parameters that displayed opposite trends in different periods of invasion such as fungal/bacterial ratios or relative amount of photosynthetically active radiation (Delta PAR). These parameters initially increased (fungal/bacterial ratio) or decreased (Delta PAR), but after reaching a certain breakpoint they tended to return to pre-invasion conditions. Differences in native species richness were best correlated with light availability and soil pH, and productivity with composition of soil microbial communities. Differences in hogweed cover were associated with soil pH and conductivity. The variation in hogweed performance in a common garden was related to the composition of soil microbial communities, soil conductivity and light availability of sites from which soil inocula were collected.

"Steinberg, CEW","NOM as Natural Xenobiotics","ADVANCES IN THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER: IMPACT ON NATURAL AND ENGINEERED SYSTEMS","In all ecosystems, natural organic matter (NOM) comprises the major reservoir of organic carbon and contains a high proportion of humic substances (HSs). HSs are natural xenobiotics that exert indirect and direct chemical challenges to exposed organisms. Xenobiotics are chemicals that are found in, but are not produced by, an organism. Indirect xenobiotic interactions comprise the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from illuminated HSs in aquatic systems that in turn can place oxidative stress on exposed organisms. This oxidative stress can select robust over sensitive species and thereby structure the community, as shown by freshwater bacteria exposed to singlet oxygen. Furthermore, this oxidative stress can reduce the activity of viruses and pathogens and can oxidize various toxins released by cyanobacteria, and thereby reduce the chemical challenge of exposed organisms. Within freshwater phytoplankton, cyanobacteria appear to be more sensitive to such chemical stress than eukaryotic phototrophs. Due to the low persistence of polyphenols in eutrophic alkaline waters, it is questionable whether these xenobiotic NOM compounds are really effective. Not all stress-responses of exposed organisms are adverse. For instance, due to the coevolution of plants and soil organic matter, HSs interact with higher plants by activating genes and complex regulation, resulting in increased stress resistance. One major phenotypic result of this interaction is the remodeling of root morphology, leading to an increased absorptive surface of the root, which mycorrhizal fungi can attack and colonize. Most plants possess mycorrhiza that enable them to efficiently take up nutrients. Exposed animals also respond to NOM on the gene, protein, and metabolic level. Low-molecular weight NOM can be internalized and can provoke oxidative stress, because animals attempt to rid themselves of natural xenobiotics. However, this oxidative stress can lead to an increased lifespan, body size, and offspring number, hence, stabilizing exposed populations. Another NOM-mediated population-stabilizing mechanism is the acquisition of multiple stress resistences where one stressor prepares the organism for another to cope with adverse effects. Evidence is accumulating that this applies to a variety of natural and anthropogenic environmental stressors, such as variations in osmotic conditions, acidity, or netting and predation. Stress-tolerance can be passed to succeeding generations by epigenetic mechanisms. Other apparently population-stabilizing mechanisms are weak feminization by NOM to reduce the maintenance costs for two separate parental bodies in ecosystems running close to their carrying capacity. Several Quantitative-Structure-Activity-Relationships (QSAR) have shown that particularly phenolic, quinoid, and stable organic radicals account for various effects in organisms exposed to NOM, irrespective of its origin. The QSAR could be confirmed in tests with the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans by enriching a given HS-preparation artificially with hydroxybenzenes. Overall, it appears that NOM is a major driving force of ecosystem functions, and we are only beginning to appreciate its ecological significance.","2014",NA,NA,"WOS:000337981900006"

Using a model mutualism-the interaction between legumes and nitrogen-fixing soil symbionts-we tested for quantitative genetic variation in plant responses to mutualistic and exploitative symbiotic rhizobia in controlled greenhouse conditions. We found significant broad-sense heritability in a legume host's preferential association with mutualistic over exploitative symbionts and selection to reduce frequency of associations with exploitative partners. We failed to detect evidence that selection will favour the loss of mutualism-stabilizing mechanisms in the absence of exploitation, as we found no evidence for a fitness cost to the host trait or indirect selection on genetically correlated traits. Our results show that genetic variation in the ability to preferentially reduce associations with an exploitative partner exists within mutualisms and is under selection, indicating that micro-evolutionary responses in mutualism-stabilizing traits in the face of rapidly evolving mutualistic and exploitative symbiotic bacteria can occur in natural host populations.","2014",NA,"10.1098/rspb.2014.2036","WOS:000344594400018"

It is well known that a significant fraction of biochar is highly stable in soil, but carbon dioxide (CO2) is also released immediately after application. This study investigated the nature of the early release of CO2 and the degree to which stabilizing mechanisms protect biochar from microbial attack. Incubations of C-14-labelled biochar produced at different temperatures were performed in soils with different clay contents and in sterilized and non-sterilized soils. It emerged that carbonate may be concentrated or form during or after biochar production, resulting in significant carbonate contents. If CO2 released from carbonates in short-term experiments is misinterpreted as mineralization of biochar, the impact of this process may be significantly over-estimated. In addition to the CO2 released from carbonates, there appears to be a labile fraction of biochar that is oxidized quickly during the first days of incubation, probably by both abiotic and biotic processes. Later in the incubation, biotic mineralization appears to be the primary cause of CO2 evolution. Finally, we found that both production temperature and clay content affect biochar mineralization. As protective mechanisms hypothesized to prevent degradation of organic matter in soil usually implicate clay, we conclude that biochar is likely to be protected from mineralization during the early stages of incubation by its own recalcitrant chemical and physical nature as well as by physical protective mechanisms.","2014",NA,"10.1111/ejss.12073","WOS:000329429800008"

Current diversity-stability studies, which have largely focused on species diversity, often report an increase in the stability of aggregate community properties with increasing species diversity. Few studies have examined the linkage between phylogenetic diversity, another important dimension of biodiversity, and stability. By taking species evolutionary history into account, phylogenetic diversity may better capture the diversity of traits and niches of species in a community than species diversity and better relate to temporal stability. In this study, we investigated whether phylogenetic diversity could affect temporal stability of community biomass independent of species diversity. Methods We performed an experiment in laboratory microcosms with a pool of 12 bacterivorous ciliated protist species. To eliminate the possibility of species diversity effects confounding with phylogenetic diversity effects, we assembled communities that had the same number of species but varied in the level of phylogenetic diversity. Weekly disturbance, in the form of short-term temperature shock, was imposed on each microcosm and species abundances were monitored over time. We examined the relationship between temporal stability of community biomass and phylogenetic diversity and evaluated the role of several stabilizing mechanisms for explaining the influence of phylogenetic diversity on temporal stability. Important Findings Our results showed that increasing phylogenetic diversity promoted temporal stability of community biomass. Both total community biomass and summed variances showed a U-shaped relationship with phylogenetic diversity, driven by the presence of large, competitively superior species that attained large biomass and high temporal variation in their biomass in both low and high phylogenetic diversity communities. Communities without these species showed patterns consistent with the reduced strength of competition and increasingly asynchronous species responses to environmental changes under higher phylogenetic diversity, two mechanisms that can drive positive diversity-stability relationships. These results support the utility of species phylogenetic knowledge for predicting ecosystem functions and their stability.","2014",NA,"10.1093/jpe/rtt071","WOS:000334928700009"

We parameterized models of nitrate uptake and growth with laboratory experiments. According to them, the species were ranked (from the best to the worst competitors): S. capricornutum, C. reinhardtii, A. falcatus and Oscillatoria sp. C. reinhardtii and Oscillatoria sp. were previously reported as allelopathic. In the present work, Oscillatoria sp. was allelopathic only against A. falcatus. However, none of our species was sensitive to C. reinhardtii. Additionally, we found an unknown allelopathic effect of A. falcatus against Oscillatoria sp. Our findings point out the high specificity of allelopathic interactions. With these data, we constructed a model of interspecific competition for nitrate, including allelopathic interactions. By performing model simulations, we studied how three factors influence the outcome of competition: relative abundance of competing species, resistance to allelopathy, and nitrate concentration. Our simulations showed that the initial ratio of species abundances will significantly determine the outcome of competition. If the worst competitor was the allelopathic species, the more it needs to outnumber the competing species, unless it is very sensitive to allelopathy (not defended). Nitrate has an important influence, showing a non-intuitive outcome of competition experiments at low nitrate concentrations, where the worst competitor (allelopathic species) wins competition in the majority of cases, whereas at intermediate concentrations, the better competitor dominates except for unfavorable ratios of abundances. With the increased amounts of nitrate, conditions again favor the worst competitor (the stronger allelopathic species). Despite the potential for two species coexistence showed by previous theoretical analysis of systems was similar to ours, our simulations did not detect this outcome.

In theory, intraguild predators can therefore be very effective as biological control agents of intraguild prey species, especially in productive environments. We investigated this hypothesis using the mixotrophic chrysophyte Ochromonas as intraguild predator and the harmful cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa as its prey. Ochromonas can grow photoautotrophically, but can also graze efficiently on Microcystis. Hence, it competes with its prey for inorganic resources. We developed a mathematical model and parameterized it for our experimental food web. The model predicts dominance of Microcystis at low nutrient loads, coexistence of both species at intermediate nutrient loads, and dominance of Ochromonas but a strong decrease of Microcystis at high nutrient loads. We tested these theoretical predictions in chemostat experiments supplied with three different nitrogen concentrations. Ochromonas initially suppressed the Microcystis abundance by >97% compared to the Microcystis monocultures. Thereafter, however, Microcystis gradually recovered to similar to 20% of its monoculture abundance at low nitrogen loads, but to 50-60% at high nitrogen loads. Hence, Ochromonas largely lost control over the Microcystis population at high nitrogen loads. We explored several mechanisms that might explain this deviation from theoretical predictions, and found that intraspecific interference at high Ochromonas densities reduced their grazing rates on Microcystis. These results illustrate the potential of intraguild predation to control pest species, but also show that the effectiveness of their biological control can be reduced in productive environments.","2014",NA,"10.1890/13-0218.1","WOS:000338109700026"
"Tucker, CM; Fukami, T","Environmental variability counteracts priority effects to facilitate species coexistence: evidence from nectar microbes","PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","The order of species arrival during community assembly can greatly affect species coexistence, but the strength of these effects, known as priority effects, appears highly variable across species and ecosystems. Furthermore, the causes of this variation remain unclear despite their fundamental importance in understanding species coexistence. Here, we show that one potential cause is environmental variability. In laboratory experiments using nectar-inhabiting microorganisms as a model system, we manipulated spatial and temporal variability of temperature, and examined consequences for priority effects. If species arrived sequentially, multiple species coexisted under variable temperature, but not under constant temperature. Temperature variability prevented extinction of late-arriving species that would have been excluded owing to priority effects if temperature had been constant. By contrast, if species arrived simultaneously, species coexisted under both variable and constant temperatures. We propose possible mechanisms underlying these results using a mathematical model that incorporates contrasting effects of microbial species on nectar pH and amino acids. Overall, our findings suggest that understanding consequences of priority effects for species coexistence requires explicit consideration of environmental variability.","2014",NA,"10.1098/rspb.2013.2637","WOS:000332382300007"

Traditional studies suggested that the growth rate of mixotrophic protists would depend on light intensity and prey abundance allowing the classification of mixotrophs into different groups. We will discuss this scheme in the scenario of protists currently present in Argentina. Additionally, we will examine the results of field and experimental studies in Argentina lakes regarding the different co-occurring factors that determine the success of different mixotrophic species. In particular, we will focus competitive interactions among mixotrophs in nature, evaluating both, photosynthetic efficiency as a result of the niche partitioning along the water column and the ingestion of picoprokaryotes for food niche overlap.

At large temporal scales (5-20 years), size distributions are unimodal, indicating that fundamental barriers to existence are here subtler than in other systems. Frequency distributions of the average size of the species weighted by biovolume are multimodal over large time scales, although this is the product of often unimodal short-term (<1 year) patterns.

While bacteria are regarded as primary mineralizers in the pelagic zone of lakes and oceans, fungi dominate OM decomposition in streams and wetlands. Recent findings indicate that fungal communities are also active in lakes, but little is known about their diversity and interactions with bacteria. Therefore, the decomposer niche overlap of saprotrophic fungi and bacteria was studied on pollen (as a seasonally recurring source of fine particulate OM) by performing microcosm experiments with three different lake types. Special emphasis was placed on analysis of fungal community composition and diversity. We hypothesized that (I) pollen select for small saprotrophic fungi and at the same time for typical particle-associated bacteria; (II) fungal communities form specific free-living and attached sub-communities in each lake type; (III) the ratio between fungi or bacteria on pollen is controlled by the lake's chemistry. Bacteria-to-fungi ratios were determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR), and bacterial and fungal diversity were studied by clone libraries and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprints. A protease assay was used to identify functional differences between treatments. For generalization, systematic differences in bacteria-to-fungi ratios were analyzed with a dataset from the nearby Baltic Sea rivers. High abundances of Chytridiomycota as well as occurrences of Cryptomycota and yeast-like fungi confirm the decomposer niche overlap of saprotrophic fungi and bacteria on pollen. As hypothesized, microbial communities consistently differed between the lake types and exhibited functional differences. Bacteria-to-fungi ratios correlated well with parameters such as organic carbon and pH. The importance of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen for bacteria-to-fungi ratios was supported by the Baltic Sea river dataset. Our findings highlight the fact that carbon-to-nitrogen ratios may also control fungal contributions to OM decomposition in aquatic ecosystems.","2014",NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0094643","WOS:000336970400062"

There is no doubting that the natural world provides mankind with the majority of the resources required to sustain life and health. Many species provide food, fuel, medicines; with the potential for many more (as of yet) undiscovered uses for various species. Despite this, there have been very few attempts to actually investigate relationships between biodiversity (i.e. number of species, rather than the ability of specific species to provide health benefits) and human health. This paper reviews the available evidence and demonstrates that while the links between biodiversity and health seem intuitive, they are very difficult to prove. Socio-economics has a huge influence on health status and the exploitation of natural resources (leading to eventual biodiversity loss) tends to have a positive economic effects. More direct effects of biodiversity on health include the diversity of the internal microbiome, the effect of natural diversity on our mental health and well-being (although this has large social aspects with many people feeling fearful in very diverse environments). Still to be elucidated are the tipping points where the level of global biodiversity loss is such that human health can no longer be sustained.","2014",NA,"10.1007/s10531-013-0614-1","WOS:000329990300001"

Here we show that two recently speciated marine bacterioplankton populations pursue different behavioral strategies to exploit nutrient particles in adaptation to the landscape of ephemeral nutrient patches characteristic of ocean water. These differences are mediated primarily by differential colonization of and dispersal among particles. Whereas one population is specialized to colonize particles by attaching and growing biofilms, the other is specialized to disperse among particles by rapidly detecting and swimming toward new particles, implying that it can better exploit short-lived patches. Because the two populations are very similar in their genomic composition, metabolic abilities, chemotactic sensitivity, and swimming speed, this fine-scale behavioral adaptation may have been responsible for the onset of the ecological differentiation between them. These results demonstrate that the principles of spatial ecology, traditionally applied at macroscales, can be extended to the ocean's microscale to understand how the rich spatiotemporal structure of the resource landscape contributes to the fine-scale ecological differentiation and species coexistence among marine bacteria.","2014",NA,"10.1073/pnas.1318943111","WOS:000334288600049"

In our work, we studied dispersal in the context of bacterial range expansions and identified the major determinants of species coexistence for a bacterial model system of three Escherichia coli strains (toxin-producing, sensitive and resistant). Genetic engineering allowed us to tune strain growth rates and to design different ecological scenarios (cyclic and hierarchical). We found that coexistence of all strains depended on three strongly interdependent factors: composition of inoculum, relative strain growth rates and effective toxin range. Robust agreement between our experiments and a thoroughly calibrated computational model enabled us to extrapolate these intricate interdependencies in terms of phenomenological biodiversity laws. Our mathematical analysis also suggested that cyclic dominance between strains is not a prerequisite for coexistence in competitive range expansions. Instead, robust three-strain coexistence required a balance between growth rates and either a reduced initial ratio of the toxin-producing strain, or a sufficiently short toxin range.","2014",NA,"10.1098/rsif.2014.0172","WOS:000336159200011"

The magnitude of such historical contingency, known as priority effects, varies across species and environments, but this variation has proven difficult to predict, presenting a major challenge in understanding species interactions and consequences for community structure and function. Here, we argue that improved predictions can be achieved by decomposing species' niches into three components: overlap, impact and requirement. Based on classic theories of community assembly, three hypotheses that emphasise related, but distinct influences of the niche components are proposed: priority effects are stronger among species with higher resource use overlap; species that impact the environment to a greater extent exert stronger priority effects; and species whose growth rate is more sensitive to changes in the environment experience stronger priority effects. Using nectar-inhabiting microorganisms as a model system, we present evidence that these hypotheses complement the conventional hypothesis that focuses on the role of environmental harshness, and show that niches can be twice as predictive when separated into components. Taken together, our hypotheses provide a basis for developing a general framework within which the magnitude of historical contingency in species interactions can be predicted.","2014",NA,"10.1111/ele.12204","WOS:000328315900013"

Intra- and interspecies 1:1 mixes of wild isolates of Dictyostelium giganteum and D.purpureum form chimaeric aggregates, following which they segregate to varying extents. Intraspecies aggregates develop in concert and give rise to chimaeric fruiting bodies that usually contain more spores (reproductives) of one component than the other.

Interspecies aggregates exhibit almost complete sorting; most spores in a fruiting body come from a single species. Between strains, somatic compatibility correlates weakly with sexual compatibility.

The invasive mosquito Aedes japonicus japonicus has established in the North American range of the competitively superior resident congener, Aedes albopictus, and the predatory native mosquito Toxorhynchites rutilus. We tested predictions for two hypotheses of invasion success and species coexistence: keystone predation and spatial partitioning. We tested competition between A. japonicus japonicus and A. albopictus with or without T. rutilus in laboratory microcosms, and measured abundances of A. japonicus japonicus, A. albopictus, other resident competing mosquito species, and the presence of T. rutilus among tree holes and tires in metropolitan Washington, DC. In laboratory microcosms, A. albopictus was competitively dominant over A. japonicus japonicus, which is consistent with the few prior studies of competition between these two Aedes species. T. rutilus predation severely lowered performances of both Aedes species but more severely lowered A. japonicus japonicus performance than A. albopictus performance when all three species co-occurred, thus yielding no evidence for keystone predation. Consistent with the spatial partitioning hypothesis, A. japonicus japonicus was negatively correlated and independently aggregated with A. albopictus and all combined resident mosquito competitors and was not associated with T. rutilus among field containers. These results suggest that predation from T. rutilus and competition from A. albopictus are barriers to the spread of A. japonicus japonicus, but that A. japonicus japonicus may escape these interspecific effects by utilizing spatially partitioned container habitats.","2014",NA,"10.1007/s00442-014-2909-7","WOS:000336378800015"

This pattern has traditionally been attributed to the habitat-filtering of bacteria that are able to survive under particular abiotic settings. According to the modern coexistence theory, however, phylogenetic clustering can also arise from biotic interactions such as the competitive exclusion of large clades with low competitive abilities. Here, we used phylogeny-based methods to discern whether the coexistence of evolutionarily related soil bacteria results from abiotic and/or biotic filtering. LocationWorldwide. MethodsWe performed a Bayesian meta-analysis based on a literature review (n=231) to assess whether the net relatedness index (NRI) or the nearest taxon index (NTI), two measures of the phylogenetic relatedness of taxa in local assemblages, deviate from those in randomly configured communities. We then sought the best abiotic (pH, total organic carbon and total nitrogen) and biotic predictors (relative abundance of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria) of NRI and NTI. ResultsPhylogenetic clustering is pervasive in soil bacterial communities regardless of the spatial and taxonomic scales (NRI=2.29; 95% CI [1.43, 3.29]; P<0.001). Clustering is accentuated by productivity; that is, more fertile soils hold communities with more closely related bacteria (estimate=1.05 [0.03, 2.15]; P<0.05). Proteobacterial abundance, which increases with organic carbon enrichment, leads to higher relatedness among coexisting bacteria (estimate=0.1 [0.02, 0.17]; P<0.01) through the competitive exclusion of distantly related deep-branching clades. Main conclusionsOur results, together with the dominance of proteobacterial lineages in soils worldwide, suggest that the overrepresentation of this clade underlies the widespread coexistence of phylogenetically related bacteria. These results are consistent with phylogenetic clustering arising via differences in competitive ability as predicted by the coexistence theory. This supports the idea that biotic filtering might have a role in driving the phylogenetic community assembly of soil prokaryotes.","2014",NA,"10.1111/geb.12227","WOS:000344591900002"

It is known that plants are able to concentrate their root biomass into areas with high nutrient content and also acquire nutrients via symbiotic microorganisms such as arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. At the same time, little is known about the small-scale distribution of soil nutrients, microbes and plant biomass occurring in the same area. We examined small-scale temporal and spatial variation as well as covariation of soil nutrients, microbial biomass (using soil fatty acid biomarker content) and above-and belowground biomass of herbaceous plants in a natural herb-rich boreonemoral spruce forest. The abundance of AM fungi and bacteria decreased during the plant growing season while soil nutrient content rather increased. The abundance of all microbes studied also varied in space and was affected by soil nutrient content. In particular, the abundance of AM fungi was negatively related to soil phosphorus and positively influenced by soil nitrogen content. Neither shoot nor root biomass of herbaceous plants showed any significant relationship with variation in soil nutrient content or the abundance of soil microbes. Our study suggests that plants can compensate for low soil phosphorus concentration via interactions with soil microbes, most probably due to a more efficient symbiosis with AM fungi. This compensation results in relatively constant plant biomass despite variation in soil phosphorous content and in the abundance of AM fungi. Hence, it is crucial to consider both soil nutrient content and the abundance of soil microbes when exploring the mechanisms driving vegetation patterns.","2014",NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0091998","WOS:000333254100100"

For P. mccullochi, fine-scale habitat associations were also assessed using the position of individual fish as observation points. A fourth species, the endemic P. bicolor, was rarely encountered. Satellite-derived sea-surface temperature was a good predictor of the distribution of the 3 commonly encountered species over the survey area. P. occidentalis were northerly distributed in warmer waters, P. victoriae were southerly distributed in cooler waters, while P. mccullochi were cosmopolitan over the survey area, with the highest densities recorded towards the centre of the study area. These findings suggest that eco-physiological theory may be applicable to describing the distribution of these, and similar, species. Similar habitat associations were observed for the 3 commonly encountered species and, in the case of P. mccullochi, at a range of spatial scales. All species were associated with vertical or overhanging rock walls and avoided areas of continuous algal canopy. P. occidentalis and P. mccullochi were associated with turfing and understorey algal forms. As the species use similar habitats, we suggest that where their distributions overlap they will experience niche overlap and resource competition.

Consistent with theory, both cheating and discrimination against cheaters are ubiquitous features of mutualisms. Several recent studies have confirmed that host species differ in the extent that they are able to discriminate against cheaters, suggesting that cheating may be stabilized by the existence of susceptible hosts (dubbed givers). We use an evolutionary game-theoretical approach to demonstrate how discriminating and giver hosts associating with mutualist and cheater partners can coexist. Discriminators drive the proportion of cheaters below a critical threshold, at which point there is no benefit to investing resources into discrimination. This promotes givers, who benefit from mutualists but allow cheater populations to rebound. We then apply this model to the plant-mycorrhizal mutualism and demonstrate it is one mechanism for generating host-specific responses to mycorrhizal fungal species necessary to generate negative plant-soil feedbacks. Our model makes several falsifiable, qualitative predictions for plant-mycorrhizal population dynamics across gradients of soil phosphorus availability and interhost differences in ability to discriminate. Finally, we suggest applications and limitations of the model with regard to coexistence in specific biological systems.","2014",NA,"10.1086/675859","WOS:000335721700004"

As the Earth's biota enters the sixth great mass extinction event recorded in the history of the planet, it is predicted that the erosion of biodiversity will result in the reduction of the goods and services that ecosystems provide. To mediate the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem function associated with wood production in temperate forests in Europe, a near-to-nature strategy has been developed. Whether this strategy enables natural assembly mechanisms of fungi responsible for major ecosystem processes is unknown. 2. We analysed variation in species richness and both the functional and phylogenetic structure of fungal assemblages of different trophic life histories (soil saprotrophic, wood saprotrophic, and ectomycorrhizal fungi) in 69 beech forest plots along a steep gradient of management intensity. We focused on reproductive traits to test the hypothesis that management intensity shifts community assembly mechanisms from limitations in niche overlap that promote the coexistence of dissimilar species to environmental filtering that selects for similar species. Specifically, we hypothesized that unpredictable resources in production forests filter the assemblages, promoting species with small fruit bodies and with small and elongated spores. 3. As management intensity increased, functional diversity decreased from a random pattern to a clustered pattern, which indicated that management intensity increased the strength of environmental filtering. However, phylogenetic diversity increased from a random pattern to an overdispersed pattern. Combining phylogenetic diversity with functional diversity did not provide additional insight into the traits but revealed a contrasting pattern. Reproduction traits of the assemblages shifted, with a decrease in mean fruit body size and an increase in spore elongation. 4. Synthesis and applications. Near-to-nature logging concepts are not able to mimic the major processes that shape fungal community assembly in protected forests. This could have severe consequences for important ecosystem functions provided by fungi. The phylogenetic overdispersion indicated that analyses of other traits in addition to reproductive traits are required to disentangle the factors affecting fungal community structure.","2014",NA,"10.1111/1365-2664.12267","WOS:000342851000012"

Here, we show from both foliage and soil N-15 natural abundance values and from a 12-year in situ N-15 addition experiment, that black spruce (Picea mariana) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana), two widespread species of the Canadian boreal forest, take up N at different depths. While black spruce takes up N from the organic soil, jack pine acquires it deeper within the highly N-depleted mineral soil. Systematic difference in foliar N-15 natural abundance between the two species across seven sites distributed throughout the eastern Canadian boreal forest shows that N spatial partitioning is a widespread phenomenon. Distinct relationships between N-15 and N concentration in leaves of both species further emphasize their difference in N acquisition strategies. This result suggests that such complementary mechanisms of N acquisition could facilitate tree species coexistence in such N-depleted habitats and could contribute to the positive biodiversity-productivity relationship recently revealed for the eastern Canadian boreal forest, where jack pine is present.

The loss of herbivorous fishes is particularly concerning as the removal of algae is crucial for the growth and survival of corals. Yet, the foraging patterns of the various herbivorous fish species are poorly understood. Using a multidimensional framework, we present novel individual-based analyses of species' realized functional niches, which we apply to a herbivorous coral reef fish community. In calculating niche volumes for 21 species, based on their microhabitat utilization patterns during foraging, and computing functional overlaps, we provide a measurement of functional redundancy or complementarity. Complementarity is the inverse of redundancy and is defined as less than 50% overlap in niche volumes. The analyses reveal extensive complementarity with an average functional overlap of just 15 center dot 2%. Furthermore, the analyses divide herbivorous reef fishes into two broad groups. The first group (predominantly surgeonfishes and parrotfishes) comprises species feeding on exposed surfaces and predominantly open reef matrix or sandy substrata, resulting in small niche volumes and extensive complementarity. In contrast, the second group consists of species (predominantly rabbitfishes) that feed over a wider range of microhabitats, penetrating the reef matrix to exploit concealed surfaces of various substratum types. These species show high variation among individuals, leading to large niche volumes, more overlap and less complementarity. These results may have crucial consequences for our understanding of herbivorous processes on coral reefs, as algal removal appears to depend strongly on species-specific microhabitat utilization patterns of herbivores. Furthermore, the results emphasize the capacity of the individual-based analyses to reveal variation in the functional niches of species, even in high-diversity systems such as coral reefs, demonstrating its potential applicability to other high-diversity ecosystems.","2014",NA,"10.1111/1365-2656.12171","WOS:000334289500014"
"Laird, RA","Population interaction structure and the coexistence of bacterial strains playing 'rock-paper-scissors'","OIKOS","The simplest example of non-transitive competition is the game rock-paper-scissors (RPS), which exhibits characteristic cyclic strategy replacement: paper beats rock, which in turn beats scissors, which in turn beats paper. In addition to its familiar use in understanding human decision-making, rock-paper-scissors is also played in many biological systems. Among other reasons, this is important because it potentially provides a mechanism whereby species- or strain coexistence can occur in the face of intense competition. Kerr et al. (2002, Nature 418: 171-174) use complementary experiments and simulations to show that RPS-playing toxic, resistant, and susceptible E. coli bacteria can coexist when interactions between the strains are spatially explicit. This raises the question of whether limited interactions associated with space are sufficient to allow strain coexistence, or whether space per se is crucial. I approach this question by extending the Kerr et al. model to include different (aspatial) population network structures with the same degree distributions as corresponding spatial lattice models. I show that the coexistence that occurs for some parameter combinations when simulated bacterial strains compete on lattices is absent when they compete on random regular graphs. Further, considering small-world networks of intermediate 'quenched randomness' between lattices and random regular graphs, I show that only small deviations from pure spatial interactions are sufficient to prevent strain coexistence. These results emphasize the explicit role of space, rather than merely limited interactions, as being decisive in allowing the coexistence of toxic, resistant, and susceptible strains in this model system.","2014",NA,"10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00879.x","WOS:000334331000011"
"Brandt, AJ; del Pino, GA; Burns, JH","Experimental Protocol for Manipulating Plant-induced Soil Heterogeneity","JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS","Coexistence theory has often treated environmental heterogeneity as being independent of the community composition; however biotic feedbacks such as plant-soil feedbacks (PSF) have large effects on plant performance, and create environmental heterogeneity that depends on the community composition. Understanding the importance of PSF for plant community assembly necessitates understanding of the role of heterogeneity in PSF, in addition to mean PSF effects. Here, we describe a protocol for manipulating plant-induced soil heterogeneity. Two example experiments are presented: (1) a field experiment with a 6-patch grid of soils to measure plant population responses and (2) a greenhouse experiment with 2-patch soils to measure individual plant responses. Soils can be collected from the zone of root influence (soils from the rhizosphere and directly adjacent to the rhizosphere) of plants in the field from conspecific and heterospecific plant species. Replicate collections are used to avoid pseudoreplicating soil samples. These soils are then placed into separate patches for heterogeneous treatments or mixed for a homogenized treatment. Care should be taken to ensure that heterogeneous and homogenized treatments experience the same degree of soil disturbance. Plants can then be placed in these soil treatments to determine the effect of plant-induced soil heterogeneity on plant performance. We demonstrate that plant-induced heterogeneity results in different outcomes than predicted by traditional coexistence models, perhaps because of the dynamic nature of these feedbacks. Theory that incorporates environmental heterogeneity influenced by the assembling community and additional empirical work is needed to determine when heterogeneity intrinsic to the assembling community will result in different assembly outcomes compared with heterogeneity extrinsic to the community composition.","2014",NA,"10.3791/51580","WOS:000348606100070"
"Norghauer, JM; Newbery, DM","Herbivores differentially limit the seedling growth and sapling recruitment of two dominant rain forest trees","OECOLOGIA","Resource heterogeneity may influence how plants are attacked and respond to consumers in multiple ways. Perhaps a better understanding of how this interaction might limit sapling recruitment in tree populations may be achieved by examining species' functional responses to herbivores on a continuum of resource availability. Here, we experimentally reduced herbivore pressure on newly established seedlings of two dominant masting trees in 40 canopy gaps, across c. 80 ha of tropical rain forest in central Africa (Korup, Cameroon). Mesh cages were built to protect individual seedlings, and their leaf production and changes in height were followed for 22 months. With more light, herbivores increasingly prevented the less shade-tolerant Microberlinia bisulcata from growing as tall as it could and producing more leaves, indicating an undercompensation. The more shade-tolerant Tetraberlinia bifoliolata was much less affected by herbivores, showing instead near to full compensation for leaf numbers, and a negligible to weak impact of herbivores on its height growth. A stage-matrix model that compared control and caged populations lent evidence for a stronger impact of herbivores on the long-term population dynamics of M. bisulcata than T. bifoliolata. Our results suggest that insect herbivores can contribute to the local coexistence of two abundant tree species at Korup by disproportionately suppressing sapling recruitment of the faster-growing dominant via undercompensation across the light gradient created by canopy disturbances. The functional patterns we have documented here are consistent with current theory, and, because gap formations are integral to forest regeneration, they may be more widely applicable in other tropical forest communities. If so, the interaction between life-history and herbivore impact across light gradients may play a substantial role in tree species coexistence.","2014",NA,"10.1007/s00442-013-2769-6","WOS:000330734100013"

We hypothesize that (1) the Cardinium-infected (C+) B. tabaci Q population cannot efficiently compete with the Cardinium-uninfected (C-) B. tabaci Q population; (2) no reproductive isolation may have occurred between C+ and C-; and (3) the C-population has higher fitness than the C+ population. Methodology and Results: To reveal the differences in competitive ability and fitness between the two introduced populations (C+ and C-), competition between C+ and C- was examined over several generations. Subsequently, the reproductive isolation between C+ and C- was studied by crossing C+ with C- individuals, and the fitnesses of C+ and C- populations were compared using a two-sex life table method. Our results demonstrate that the competitive ability of the C+ whiteflies was weaker than that of C-. There is that no reproductive isolation occurred between the two populations and the C- population had higher fitness than the C+ population. Conclusion: The competitive ability and fitness differences of two populations may explain why C- whitefly populations have been dominant during the past few years in Shandong, China.

We work in a parameter regime where only those mutants that are a single mutation away are accessible, as a result of which the population eventually gets trapped at a local fitness maximum and the adaptive walk terminates. We study how the number of adaptive steps taken by the population before reaching a local fitness peak depends on the initial fitness of the population, the extreme value distribution of the beneficial mutations, and correlations among the fitnesses. Assuming that the relative fitness difference between successive steps is small, we analytically calculate the average walk length for both uncorrelated and correlated fitnesses in all extreme value domains for a given initial fitness. We present numerical results for the model where the fitness differences can be large and find that the walk length behavior differs from that in the former model in the Frechet domain of extreme value theory. We also discuss the relevance of our results to microbial experiments.","2014",NA,"10.1103/PhysRevE.90.032703","WOS:000341297600006"

However, selection for disfavoured CPs leads to unintended increases in CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequencies that also attenuate replication. We designed and phenotypically characterised mutants of the picornavirus, echovirus 7, in which these parameters were independently varied to determine which most influenced virus replication. CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequencies primarily influenced virus replication ability while no fitness differences were observed between mutants with different CP usage where dinucleotide frequencies were kept constant. Contrastingly, translation efficiency was unaffected by either CP usage or dinucleotide frequencies. This mechanistic insight is critical for future rational design of live virus vaccines and their safety evaluation; attenuation is mediated through enhanced innate immune responses to viruses with elevated CpG/UpA dinucleotide frequencies rather the viruses themselves being intrinsically defective.","2014",NA,"10.7554/eLife.04531","WOS:000346170300008"

Class II hydrophobins from Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium culmorum are characterized by formation of low stability aggregates and their solubility in organic solvents. They are economically relevant to the brewing industry because they can induce beer gushing. Since cellular functions of Hyd5p's are still unknown, we analyzed the influence of FgHyd5p on growth and morphology of F. graminearum using Fg Delta hyd5 knock-out mutants expressing sGFP under the control of the hyd5 promoter and compared them with the performance of the parent wild type strain. Results demonstrate that FgHyd5p does not affect the colony and hyphal morphology. FgHyd5p affects the hydrophobicity of aerial mycelia but had no obvious function in penetration of hyphae through the water air interface. The hydrophobin affects the morphology of conidia, but not their fitness.

The influence of population size and density on fitness effects are unknown, despite the central role population size plays in the supply and fixation of mutations. We addressed this issue by comparing the fitness of 92 Keio strains (Escherichia coli K12 single gene knockouts) at comparatively high (1.2x10(7) CFUs/mL) and low (2.5x10(2) CFUs/mL) densities, which also differed in population size (high: 1.2x10(8); low: 1.25x10(3)). Twenty-eight gene deletions (30%) exhibited a fitness difference, ranging from 5 to 174% (median: 35%), between the high and low densities. Our analyses suggest this variation among gene deletions in fitness responses reflected in part both gene orientation and function, of the gene properties we examined (genomic position, length, orientation, and function). Although we could not determine the relative effects of population density and size, our results suggest fitness effects of mutations vary with these two factors, and this variation is gene-specific. Besides being a mechanism for density-dependent selection (r-K selection), the dependence of fitness effects on population density and size has implications for any population that varies in size over time, including populations undergoing evolutionary rescue, species invasions into novel habitats, and cancer progression and metastasis. Further, combined with recent advances in understanding the roles of other context-specific factors in the fitness effects of mutations, our results will help address theoretical and applied biological questions more realistically.","2014",NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0105369","WOS:000341017000120"
"Simonsen, AK; Chow, T; Stinchcombe, JR","Reduced plant competition among kin can be explained by Jensen's inequality","ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","Plants often compete with closely related individuals due to limited dispersal, leading to two commonly invoked predictions on competitive outcomes. Kin selection, from evolutionary theory, predicts that competition between relatives will likely be weaker. The niche partitioning hypothesis, from ecological theory, predicts that competition between close relatives will likely be stronger. We tested for evidence consistent with either of these predictions by growing an annual legume in kin and nonkin groups in the greenhouse. We grew plant groups in treatments of symbiotic nitrogen fixing bacteria differing in strain identity and composition to determine if differences in the microbial environment can facilitate or obscure plant competition patterns consistent with kin selection or niche partitioning. Nonkin groups had lower fitness than expected, based on fitness estimates of the same genotypes grown among kin. Higher fitness among kin groups was observed in mixtures of N-fixing bacteria strains compared to single inoculations of bacteria strains present in the soil, which increased fitness differences between kin and nonkin groups. Lower fitness in nonkin groups was likely caused by increased competitive asymmetry in nonkin groups due to genetic differences in plant size combined with saturating relationships with plant size and fitness- i.e. Jensen's inequality. Our study suggests that microbial soil symbionts alter competitive dynamics among kin and nonkin. Our study also suggests that kin groups can have higher fitness, as predicted by kin selection theory, through a commonly heritable trait (plant size), without requiring kin recognition mechanisms.","2014",NA,"10.1002/ece3.1312","WOS:000346084500003"

Unless populations are well mixed (like bacteria in a shaken test tube), the spreading dynamics depend not only on fitness differences but also on the dispersal behavior of the species. Spreading at a constant speed is generally predicted when dispersal is sufficiently short ranged, specifically when the dispersal kernel falls off exponentially or faster. However, the case of long-range dispersal is unresolved: Although it is clear that even rare long-range jumps can lead to a drastic speedup-as air-traffic-mediated epidemics show-it has been difficult to quantify the ensuing stochastic dynamical process. However, such knowledge is indispensable for a predictive understanding of many spreading processes in natural populations. We present a simple iterative scaling approximation supported by simulations and rigorous bounds that accurately predicts evolutionary spread, which is determined by a trade-off between frequency and potential effectiveness of long-distance jumps. In contrast to the exponential laws predicted by deterministic mean-field approximations, we show that the asymptotic spatial growth is according to either a power law or a stretched exponential, depending on the tails of the dispersal kernel. More importantly, we provide a full time-dependent description of the convergence to the asymptotic behavior, which can be anomalously slow and is relevant even for long times. Our results also apply to spreading dynamics on networks with a spectrum of long-range links under certain conditions on the probabilities of long-distance travel: These are relevant for the spread of epidemics.","2014",NA,"10.1073/pnas.1404663111","WOS:000345153300005"

Elucidating the response to cold in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is of paramount importance for the selection or genetic improvement of wine strains. Results: We followed a global approach by comparing transcriptomic, proteomic and genomic changes in two commercial wine strains, which showed clear differences in their growth and fermentation capacity at low temperature. These strains were selected according to the maximum growth rate in a synthetic grape must during miniaturized batch cultures at different temperatures. The fitness differences of the selected strains were corroborated by directly competing during fermentations at optimum and low temperatures. The up-regulation of the genes of the sulfur assimilation pathway and glutathione biosynthesis suggested a crucial role in better performance at low temperature. The presence of some metabolites of these pathways, such as S-Adenosilmethionine (SAM) and glutathione, counteracted the differences in growth rate at low temperature in both strains. Generally, the proteomic and genomic changes observed in both strains also supported the importance of these metabolic pathways in adaptation at low temperature. Conclusions: This work reveals a novel role of the sulfur assimilation pathway in adaptation at low temperature. We propose that a greater activation of this metabolic route enhances the synthesis of key metabolites, such as glutathione, whose protective effects can contribute to improve the fermentation process.","2014",NA,"10.1186/1471-2164-15-1059","WOS:000346388000002"

Here, we analyze the activity of a putative 65-kb ICE harbored by Legionella pneumophila using molecular genetics, conjugation assays, a phenotype microarray screen, and macrophage infections. The element transferred to a naive L. pneumophila strain, integrated site-specifically, and conferred increased resistance to oxacillin, penicillin, hydrogen peroxide, and bleach. Furthermore, the element increased survival of L. pneumophila within restrictive mouse macrophages. In particular, this ICE protects L. pneumophila from phagocyte oxidase activity, since mutation of the macrophage NADPH oxidase eliminated the fitness difference between strains that carried and those that lacked the mobile element. Renamed ICE-beta ox (for beta-lactam antibiotics and oxidative stress), this transposable element is predicted to contribute to the emergence of L. pneumophila strains that are more fit in natural and engineered water systems and in macrophages. IMPORTANCE Bacteria evolve rapidly by acquiring new traits via horizontal gene transfer. Integrative conjugative elements (ICEs) are mobile blocks of DNA that encode the machinery necessary to spread among bacterial populations. ICEs transfer antibiotic resistance and other bacterial survival factors as cargo genes carried within the element. Here, we show that Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, carries ICE-beta ox, which enhances the resistance of this opportunistic pathogen to bleach and beta-lactam antibiotics. Moreover, L. pneumophila strains encoding ICE-beta ox are more resistant to macrophages that carry phagocyte oxidase. Accordingly, ICE-beta ox is predicted to increase the fitness of L. pneumophila in natural and engineered waters and in humans. To our knowledge, this is the first description of an ICE that confers oxidative stress resistance to a nosocomial pathogen.","2014",NA,"10.1128/mBio.01091-14","WOS:000338875900024"

Modelling this mathematically is problematic since strains within a functional group are often competing for the same limited number of resources and therefore competitive exclusion theory predicts a loss of diversity over time. Here we investigate, through computer simulation, a fluctuation dependent mechanism for the promotion of diversity. A variable pH environment caused by acidic by-products of bacterial growth on a fluctuating substrate coupled with small differences in acid tolerance between strains promotes diversity under both equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium conditions. Under equilibrium conditions pH fluctuations and relative nonlinearity in pH limitation among strains combine to prevent complete competitive exclusion. Under far-from-equilibrium conditions, loss of diversity through extinctions is made more difficult because pH cycling leads to fluctuations in the competitive ranking of strains, thereby helping to equalise fitness. We assume a trade-off between acid tolerance and maximum growth rate so that our microbial system consists of strains ranging from specialists to generalists. By altering the magnitude of the effect of the system on its pH environment (e.g. the buffering capacity of the colon) and the pattern of incoming resource we explore the conditions that promote diversity.

For this, we propose the trait-modulated Gaussian logistic model in which the niche parameters (optimum, tolerance and maximum) are made linearly dependent on species traits. The model is fitted to data in the Bayesian framework using OpenBUGS (Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling) to identify according to which environmental variables there is niche differentiation among species and traits. We illustrate the method with phytoplankton community data of 203 lakes located within four climate zones and associated measurements on 11 environmental variables and six morphological species traits of 60 species. Temperature and chlorophyll-a (with opposite signs) described well the niche structure of all species. Results showed that about 25% of the variance in the niche centres with respect to chlorophyll-a were accounted for by traits, whereas niche width and maximum could not be predicted by traits. Volume, mucilage, flagella and siliceous exoskeleton are found to be the most important traits to explain the niche centres. Species were clustered in two groups with different niches structures, group 1 high temperature-low chlorophyll-a species and group 2 low temperature-high chlorophyll-a species. Compared to group 2, species in group 1 had larger volume but lower surface area, had more often flagella but neither mucilage nor siliceous exoskeleton. These results might help in understanding the effect of environmental changes on phytoplankton community.

Huge inputs of nitrogen-based fertilizers into terrestrial ecosystems accelerate soil acidification, concomitantly altering the nitrogen transformation processes. Nitrification, as a critical component of the nitrogen cycle, is a microbially mediated process from ammonia to nitrate via nitrite, contributing to enormous losses of fertilizers through atmospheric emissions of greenhouse gas N2O and nitrate leaching to groundwater. However, the functionally dominant nitrifiers and underlying mechanisms for the acid soil nitrification are a long-standing mystery, which have confused scientists for more than 100 years. This century-long paradox originated from the early observations of active nitrification activity in acid soils, intensified by the failure of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) cultures to sustain the nitrification in liquid batch under acid conditions, might be resolved by the recent progress in metagenomic, isotopic probing studies, and isolation of acidophilic ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA). Emerging evidence led to the supposition of the predominant role of AOA in controlling the autotrophic ammonia oxidation of acid soils, which has radically revised the previous perception that this oxidative reaction was exclusively regulated by autotrophic AOB and occasionally by heterotrophic nitrifiers. In this chapter, we review the recent progress in our understanding of the pH-impacted distribution of ammonia oxidizers, the niche differentiation of AOA and AOB shaped by acid stress, and the possible mechanisms of autotrophic nitrification in acid soils. The unveiling of this key process in widely distributed acid soils would help to identify effective biological strategies for better management of terrestrial nitrogen turnover and balance.","2014",NA,"10.1016/B978-0-12-800137-0.00006-6","WOS:000334129100006"

ANME/seepDBB aggregates were most abundant in shallow sediment depths below sulfide-oxidizing microbial mats. Depth profiles of ANME/seepDBB aggregate abundance revealed a positive correlation with elevated porewater nitrate relative to ANME/DSS aggregates in all seep sites examined. This relationship with nitrate was supported by sediment microcosm experiments, in which the abundance of ANME/seepDBB was greater in nitrate-amended incubations relative to the unamended control. FISH-NanoSIMS additionally revealed significantly higher N-15-nitrate incorporation levels in individual aggregates of ANME/seepDBB relative to ANME/DSS aggregates from the same incubation. These combined results suggest that nitrate is a geochemical effector of ANME/seepDBB aggregate distribution, and provides a unique niche for these consortia through their utilization of a greater range of nitrogen substrates than the ANME/DSS.","2014",NA,"10.1038/ismej.2013.147","WOS:000328605200015"

Terrestrial ecosystems account for nearly 70% of total global N2O atmospheric loading, of which at least 45% can be attributed to microbial cycling of nitrogen in agriculture(3). The reduction of N2O to nitrogen gas by microorganisms is critical for mitigating its emissions from terrestrial ecosystems, yet the determinants of a soil's capacity to act as a source or sink for N2O remain uncertain(4). Here, we demonstrate that the soil N2O sink capacity is mostly explained by the abundance and phylogenetic diversity of a newly described N2O-reducing microbial group(5,6), which mediate the influence of edaphic factors. Analyses of interactions and niche preference similarities suggest niche differentiation or even competitive interactions between organisms with the two types of N2O reductase. We further identified several recurring communities comprised of co-occurring N2O-reducing bacterial genotypes that were significant indicators of the soil N2O sink capacity across different European soils.","2014",NA,"10.1038/NCLIMATE2301","WOS:000341569700022"

For sympatric but not allopatric populations, antibiotic inhibition is significantly positively correlated with niche overlap, indicating that inhibition is targeted toward bacteria that pose the greatest competitive threat. Our results support the hypothesis that antibiotics serve as weapons in mediating local microbial interactions in soil and suggest that coevolutionary niche displacement may reduce the likelihood of an antibiotic arms race.

SAR11 is divided into subclades with distinct spatiotemporal distributions (ecotypes), some of which appear to be specific to deep water. Here we examine the genomic basis for deep ocean distribution of one SAR11 bathytype (depth-specific ecotype), subclade Ic. Four single-cell Ic genomes, with estimated completeness of 55%-86%, were isolated from 770m at station ALOHA and compared with eight SAR11 surface genomes and metagenomic datasets. Subclade Ic genomes dominated metagenomic fragment recruitment below the euphotic zone. They had similar COG distributions, high local synteny and shared a large number (69%) of orthologous clusters with SAR11 surface genomes, yet were distinct at the 16S rRNA gene and amino-acid level, and formed a separate, monophyletic group in phylogenetic trees. Subclade Ic genomes were enriched in genes associated with membrane/cell wall/envelope biosynthesis and showed evidence of unique phage defenses. The majority of subclade Ic-specfic genes were hypothetical, and some were highly abundant in deep ocean metagenomic data, potentially masking mechanisms for niche differentiation. However, the evidence suggests these organisms have a similar metabolism to their surface counterparts, and that subclade Ic adaptations to the deep ocean do not involve large variations in gene content, but rather more subtle differences previously observed deep ocean genomic data, like preferential amino-acid substitutions, larger coding regions among SAR11 clade orthologs, larger intergenic regions and larger estimated average genome size.","2014",NA,"10.1038/ismej.2013.243","WOS:000338213900009"

We introduce a new game-theoretic model for competing microorganisms in which one player consists of all organisms of one species. The stable points for the population dynamics in our model, known as strategic behaviour distributions (SBDs), are probability distributions of behaviours across all organisms which imply a stable population of the species as a whole. We find that intra-specific variability is the key characteristic that ultimately allows coexistence because the outcomes of competitions between individuals with variable competitive abilities are unpredictable. Our simulations based on the theoretical model show that up to 100 species can coexist for at least 10 000 generations, and that even small population sizes or species with inferior competitive ability can survive when there is intra-specific variability. In nature, this variability can be observed as niche differentiation, variability in environmental and ecological factors, and variability of individual behaviours or physiology. Therefore, previous specific explanations of the paradox are consistent with and provide specific examples of our suggestion that individual variability is the mechanism which solves the paradox.","2014",NA,"10.1098/rsif.2014.0031","WOS:000335639900014"

They comprise methane-producing Euryarchaeota as well as ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaeota, but their community structures and population dynamics have not yet been studied in the same system. Different soil compartments (surface, bulk, rhizospheric soil) and ages of roots (young and old roots) at two N fertilization levels and at three time points (the panicle initiation, heading and maturity periods) of the season were assayed by determining the abundance (using qPCR) and composition (using T-RFLP and cloning/sequencing) of archaeal genes (mcrA, amoA, 16S rRNA gene). The community of total Archaea in soil and root samples mainly consisted of the methanogens and the Thaumarchaeota and their abundance increased over the season. Methanogens proliferated everywhere, but Thaumarchaeota proliferated only on the roots and in response to nitrogen fertilization. The community structures of Archaea, methanogens and Thaumarchaeota were different in soil and root samples indicating niche differentiation. While Methanobacteriales were generally present, Methanosarcinaceae and Methanocellales were the dominant methanogens in soil and root samples, respectively.

However, only one ant species, Euprenolepis pro cera (EMERY, 1900) (Formicidae: Formicinae), has been described as a specialist harvester of wild-growing mushrooms. Mushrooms are a very abundant food source in certain habitats, but utilizing them is expected to require specific adaptations. Here, we report the discovery of another, sympatric, and widespread mushroom harvesting ant, Euprenolepis wittei LAPOLLA, 2009. The similarity in nutritional niches of both species was expected to be accompanied by similarities in adaptive behavior and differences due to competitive avoidance. Similarities were found in mushroom acceptance and harvesting behavior: Both species harvested a variety of wild-growing mushrooms and formed characteristic mushroom piles inside the nest that were processed continuously by adult workers. Euprenolepis procera was apparently dominant at mushroom baits displacing the smaller, less numerous E. wittei foragers. However, interspecific competition for mushrooms is likely relaxed by differences in other niche dimensions, particularly the temporal activity pattern. The discovery of a second, widespread mushroom harvesting ant suggests that this life style is more common than previously thought, at least in Southeast Asia, and has implications for the ecology of tropical rainforests.

Our results further suggest a widespread colonization of possible ecological niches as taxonomic diversity increases.

We hypothesized that the shrimp Palaemon peringueyi, the mud prawn Upogebia africana and the sand prawn Callichirus kraussi have disparate diets due to interspecific differences in metabolism and feeding mode and that diets of the crustaceans all change temporally due to variations in available food. The species with the most variable diet was expected to have the greatest niche differentiation. We sampled the 3 crustaceans and their food sources on occasions spanning 4 seasons. The diet of P. peringueyi changed from a dominance of benthic microalgae in spring and winter to increased contributions of particulate organic matter (POM) in summer, with preferential sequestration of 22:6 omega 3. U. africana showed a stable dependence on estuarine POM as the main source of its energy, while C. kraussi relied more on marine POM, except in winter, when benthic microalgae was an important energy source. The 2 infaunal prawns showed elevated proportions of 16:1 omega 7 and 20:5 omega 3 throughout most of the year, probably originating from diatoms. P. peringueyi showed a different preferred diet than the 2 prawns, resulting in an isotopic niche segregation from the infaunal prawns, but the fatty acid niche of the shrimp overlapped with the prawns. Stable isotope values revealed the temporal variations in the origins and proportions of different food sources contributing to the diet of each species, while fatty acid data provided information on finer-scale trophic interactions.

Spatial heterogeneity of microbial populations, contaminants and soil chemical parameters on such sites is a major hurdle in optimizing and implementing an appropriate bioremediation regime. We performed a grid-based sampling of an aged creosote-contaminated site followed by geostatistical modelling to illustrate the spatial patterns of microbial diversity and activity and to relate these patterns to the distribution of pollutants. Spatial distribution of bacterial groups unveiled patterns of niche differentiation regulated by patchy distribution of pollutants and an east-to-west pH gradient at the studied site. Proteobacteria clearly dominated in the hot spots of creosote pollution, whereas the abundance of Actinobacteria, TM7 and Planctomycetes was considerably reduced from the hot spots. The pH preferences of proteobacterial groups dominating in pollution could be recognized by examining the order and family-level responses. Acidobacterial classes came across as generalists in hydrocarbon pollution whose spatial distribution seemed to be regulated solely by the pH gradient. Although the community evenness decreased in the heavily polluted zones, basal respiration and fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis rates were higher, indicating the adaptation of specific indigenous microbial populations to hydrocarbon pollution. Combining the information from the kriged maps of microbial and soil chemistry data provided a comprehensive understanding of the long-term impacts of creosote pollution on the subsurface microbial communities. This study also highlighted the prospect of interpreting taxa-specific spatial patterns and applying them as indicators or proxies for monitoring polluted sites.","2014",NA,"10.1038/ismej.2014.151","WOS:000342764600015"

We focus our attention on light intensity as the major axes of niche differentiation in Pcy. We present examples regarding the distribution of distinct Pcy ecotypes adapted to high- and low-light intensities at different depths in the water column of deep and shallow transparent lakes.

The relevance of the depth of the euphotic layer and nutrient concentration as the main abiotic features explaining the variability encountered are discussed. The PPP from eutrophic shallow lakes and relict oxbow lakes from wetlands from the Lower Parana Basin are mainly represented by PC-rich Pcy, and Peuk in a lesser extent.

Therefore, we studied nitrification activity in relation to abundance and composition of Thaumarchaeota in an acidic red soil from China, using microcosms incubated with and without cellulose amendment. Cellulose was selected to simulate the input of crop residues used to increase soil fertility by local farming. Accumulation of NO3- -N was correlated with the growth of Thaumarchaeota as determined by qPCR of 16S rRNA and ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) genes. Both nitrification activity and thaumarchaeotal growth were inhibited by acetylene. They were also inhibited by cellulose amendment, possibly due to the depletion of ammonium by enhanced heterotrophic assimilation. These results indicated that growth of Thaumarchaeota was dependent on ammonia oxidation.

A microcosm-based study of ammonia-oxidising archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB), employing a grassland soil that rarely experiences drought, was used to test this hypothesis and also whether AOB were more resistant and resilient, through greater tolerance of high ammonia concentrations produced during drought and rewetting.

AOA abundance and community composition were less resistant than AOB during drought and less resilient after rewetting, at times when ammonium concentration was higher.

As a consequence, intragenus or intraspecies metabolic versatility in nitrogen metabolism was never evaluated nor considered among methanotrophic bacteria as a source of differential responses of methane oxidation to nitrogen amendments. Results: We demonstrated that fourteen genotypically different Methylomonas strains, thus distinct below the level at which most techniques assign operational taxonomic units (OTU), show a versatile physiology in their nitrogen metabolism. Differential responses, even among strains with identical 16S rRNA or pmoA gene sequences, were observed for production of nitrite and nitrous oxide from nitrate or ammonium, nitrogen fixation and tolerance to high levels of ammonium, nitrate, and hydroxylamine. Overall, reduction of nitrate to nitrite, nitrogen fixation, higher tolerance to ammonium than nitrate and tolerance and assimilation of nitrite were general features. Conclusions: Differential responses among closely related methanotrophic strains to overcome inhibition and toxicity from high nitrogen loads and assimilation of various nitrogen sources yield competitive fitness advantages to individual methane-oxidizing bacteria.

The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functions quantified in prior experiments suggests that initial losses of biodiversity have relatively small impacts on properties like community biomass production; however, beyond some threshold, increasing losses lead to accelerating declines in function. Some have questioned whether a saturating relationship between diversity and community biomass production is an artifact of overly simplified experiments that manipulate diversity in homogeneous conditions over short time-scales in which niche differences may not be realized. Others have questioned whether even the modest effects of biodiversity observed in experiments would be discernible in natural systems where they could be over-ridden by the stronger influence of abiotic factors. Here, we used a biogeographic dataset to assess how the taxonomic richness of aquatic primary producers relates to community biomass in unmanipulated lake ecosystems in the US, and then compared these findings to prior experiments. We used structural equation modeling to evaluate hypotheses about the effects of algal richness on community biomass while accounting for covariance with environmental parameters measured in the USEPA's National Lakes Assessment (NLA), which sampled 1157 freshwater lakes. These analyses converged on a single best-fit model ((2)= 0.31, p = 0.58) wherein community algal biomass was a function of three explanatory variables - nitrogen, phosphorus, and algal richness. The quantitative magnitude of the algal diversity (x) - biomass (y) relationship in the NLA dataset is statistically greater than that documented in the average biodiversity experiment. It did, however, lie at approximately the 75th percentile of experimental relationships, indicating the diversity-biomass relationship in unmanipulated lakes is within the range that has been characterized experimentally.","2014",NA,"10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00777.x","WOS:000331660800002"

The process is thought to be mediated by three groups of uncultivated methane-oxidizing archaea (ANME-1, 2 and 3). Although the responsible microbes have been intensively studied for more than a decade, central mechanistic details remain unresolved. On the basis of an integrated analysis of both environmental metatranscriptome and single-aggregate genome of a highly active AOM enrichment dominated by ANME-2a, we provide evidence for a complete and functioning AOM pathway in ANME-2a. All genes required for performing the seven steps of methanogenesis from CO2 were found present and actively expressed. Meanwhile, genes for energy conservation and electron transportation including those encoding F420H2 dehydrogenase (Fpo), the cytoplasmic and membrane-associated Coenzyme B-Coenzyme M heterodisulfide (CoB-S-SCoM) reductase (HdrABC,HdrDE), cytochrome C and the Rhodobacter nitrogen fixation (Rnf) complex were identified and expressed, whereas genes encoding for hydrogenases were absent. Thus, ANME-2a is likely performing AOM through a complete reversal of methanogenesis from CO2 reduction without involvement of canonical hydrogenase. ANME-2a is demonstrated to possess versatile electron transfer pathways that would provide the organism with more flexibility in substrate utilization and capacity for rapid adjustment to fluctuating environments.

These allochthonous inputs are a potential high-quality food subsidy for beach fauna, but little is known about the feeding ecology and niche segregation strategies of these species in beaches with limited wrack availabilities. We used stable isotopic ratios of nitrogen and carbon to examine the diets and niche segregation among three sympatric crustaceans, the amphipods Talitrus saltator and Talorchestia brito, and the isopod Tylos europaeus, in two temperate beaches, Cabedelo and Quiaios, on the Portuguese Atlantic coast, with contrasting wrack availabilities, over winter and summer. In the beach with limited wrack (Quiaios), consumers showed significantly different interspecific and temporal isotopic signatures, suggesting a distinct foraging habitat and niche differentiation. Mixing models outputs (SIAR) revealed in this case a seasonal shift in the diet of consumers from terrestrial sources in winter towards marinebased sources (phytoplankton) in the summer. In contrast, at Cabedelo, consumers showed clear overlap in isotopic signatures, with similar contributions of the available wrack to their diets. As a whole, an opportunistic and generalist feeding behaviour was described for these species, namely for T. saltator. Isotopic profiles support the occurrence of spatial overlap during summer but different foraging strategies of the three species in these beaches during winter. Our results show that on temperate beaches with ephemeral wrack supplies, consumers might need to adopt different foraging strategies and niche segregation for their subsistence, and additionally illustrate the viability of using stable isotopes to capture subtle changes in trophic niches.

Drought can affect soil nitrogen (N) cycling, by altering N transformation rates, as well as the abundances of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea. However, the extent to which drought affects N cycling under in situ conditions is still controversial. The goal of this study was to analyse effects of drought on soil N turnover and ammonia-oxidizer abundances in soil without drought history. To this end we conducted rain-exclusion experiments at two differently managed mountain grassland sites, an annually mown and occasionally fertilized meadow and an abandoned grassland. Soils were sampled before, during and after drought and were analysed for potential gross rates of N mineralization, microbial uptake of inorganic N, nitrification, and the abundances of bacterial and archaeal ammonia-oxidizers based on gene copy numbers of the amoA gene (AOB and AOA, respectively). Drought induced different responses at the two studied sites. At the managed meadow drought increased NH4+ immobilization rates and NH4+ concentrations in the soil water solution, but led to a reduction of AOA abundance compared to controls. At the abandoned site gross nitrification and NO3- immobilization rates decreased during drought, while AOB and AOA abundances remained stable. Rewetting had only minor, short-term effects on the parameters that had been affected by drought. Seven weeks after the end of drought no differences to control plots could be detected. Thus, our findings demonstrated that in mountain grasslands drought had distinct transient effects on soil nitrogen cycling and ammonia-oxidizers, which could have been related to a niche differentiation of AOB and AOA with increasing NH4+ levels. However, the effect strength of drought was modulated by grassland management.","2014",NA,"10.5194/bg-11-6003-2014","WOS:000344649700001"

Plots laid out in agricultural fields of a research station in Egypt, were cultivated with cucumber and treated with two chemical fungicides: Ridomil Plus 50% wp (active ingredients = metalaxyl and copper oxychloride) and Dithane M-45 (active ingredient = mancozeb), and two biofungicides: Plant Guard (containing the antagonistic fungus Trichoderma harzianum) and Polyversum (containing the fungi-parasitic oomycete Pythium oligandrum). All treatments were done using both low-volume and high-volume spraying techniques to check whether any effects were dependent on the method of application. Oribatid mite communities were assessed from soil core samples collected during the growing season. Total abundance of oribatids was not different across the plots, but some species decreased in number, while one species increased. Species diversity and community equitability decreased with the application of chemical and biofungicides especially when using high-volume spraying. In control plots most oribatid species showed a significant degree of aggregation, which tended to decrease under fungicide treatment. Ridomil Plus, Plant Guard and Polyversum had a negative effect on the gravid/ungravid ratio of some species. Egg number averaged over the whole adult population was not directly related to the application of chemical and biofungicides but it showed a species-specific relationship with population density. In general biofungicides had a smaller effect on population size and community structure of oribatid mite species than chemical fungicides. The results indicate that biofungicides may be the preferred option when aiming to prevent side-effects on sensitive groups among the species-rich soil detritivore community. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

"Shen, JP; Xu, ZH; He, JZ","Frontiers in the microbial processes of ammonia oxidation in soils and sediments","JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS","Purpose Two recent discoveries in nitrogen (N) cycling processes, i.e., archaeal ammonia oxidizers and anaerobic ammonia (ammonium) oxidation (anammox), have triggered great interest in studying microbial ammonia oxidation processes. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent progress in ammonia oxidation processes in soils and sediments and to propose future research activities in this topic. Results and discussion Aerobic ammonia oxidation and anammox processes are linked through the production and consumption of nitrite, respectively, thereby removing the reactive N (NH4+, NO2-, NO3-) from soil and sediment ecosystems. Ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms are widely distributed in soils and sediments, and increasing evidence suggests that ammonia-oxidizing archaea and bacteria are functionally dominant in the ammonia oxidation of acid soils and other soils, respectively. The widespread occurrence and great variation in the abundance of anammox bacteria indicate their heterogeneous distribution and niche differentiation. Therefore, the worldwide distribution of both microbial groups in nature has stimulated researchers to investigate the physiology and metabolism of related groups, as well as appraising their contribution to N cycling. Conclusions We summarized the current progress and provided future perspectives in the microbiology of aerobic and anaerobic ammonia oxidation in soils and sediments. With increasing concern and interest in soil and sediment ammonia oxidation processes, studies in the microbial mechanisms underlying nitrification and anammox, as well as their interactions, are essential for understanding their contribution to the loss of N either through nitrate leaching or N-related gas emissions.","2014",NA,"10.1007/s11368-014-0872-x","WOS:000336080800001"

We need to expand our insight between the feeding guilds of fauna and not just count biodiversity. The soil fauna drive nutrient cycling and play a pivotal, but little understood role within both the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles that may be ecosystem dependent. Here, we define the structure of the SFW in two habitats (grassland and woodland) on the same soil type and test the hypothesis that land management would alter the SFW in these habitats. To do this, we census the community structure and use stable isotope analysis to establish the pathway of C and N through each trophic level within the ecosystems. Stable isotope ratios of C and N from all invertebrates were used as a proxy for trophic niche, and community-wide metrics were obtained. Our empirically derived C/N ratios differed from those previously reported, diverging from model predictions of global C and N cycling, which was unexpected. An assessment of the relative response of the different functional groups to the change from agricultural grassland to woodland was performed. This showed that abundance of herbivores, microbivores, and micropredators were stimulated, while omnivores and macropredators were inhibited in the grassland. Differences between stable isotope ratios and community-wide metrics, highlighted habitats with similar taxa had different SFWs, using different basal resources, either driven by root or litter derived resources. Overall, we conclude that plant type can act as a top-down driver of community functioning and that differing land management can impact on the whole SFW.","2014",NA,"10.1002/ece3.905","WOS:000329183100001"

In this paper, we describe the microbial diversity of Roraima Sur Cave (RSC), an orthoquartzite (SiO4) cave within Roraima Tepui, Venezuela. The cave contains a high level of microbial activity when compared with other cave systems, as determined by an ATP-based luminescence assay and cell counting. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of microbial diversity within the cave demonstrates the dominance of Actinomycetales and Alphaproteobacteria in endolithic bacterial communities close to the entrance, while communities from deeper in the cave are dominated (82-84%) by a unique clade of Ktedonobacterales within the Chloroflexi. While members of this phylum are commonly found in caves, this is the first identification of members of the Class Ktedonobacterales. An assessment of archaeal species demonstrates the dominance of phylotypes from the Thaumarchaeota Group I.1c (100%), which have previously been associated with acidic environments. While the Thaumarchaeota have been seen in numerous cave systems, the dominance of Group I.1c in RSC is unique and a departure from the traditional archaeal community structure. Geochemical analysis of the cave environment suggests that water entering the cave, rather than the nutrient-limited orthoquartzite rock, provides the carbon and energy necessary for microbial community growth and subsistence, while the poor buffering capacity of quartzite or the low pH of the environment may be selecting for this unusual community structure. Together these data suggest that pH, imparted by the geochemistry of the host rock, can play as important a role in niche-differentiation in caves as in other environmental systems.","2014",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2014.00615","WOS:000345991200001"

In America, insectivorous bats are natural reservoirs of rabies virus. The bat species Tadarida brasiliensis and Lasiurus cinereus, with their respective, host-specific rabies virus variants AgV4 and AgV6, are the principal rabies reservoirs in Chile. However, little is known about the roles of bat species in the ecology and geographic distribution of the virus. This contribution aims to address a series of questions regarding the ecology of rabies transmission in Chile. Analyzing records from 1985-2011 at the Instituto de Salud Publica de Chile (ISP) and using ecological niche modeling, we address these questions to help in understanding rabies-bat ecological dynamics in South America. We found ecological niche identity between both hosts and both viral variants, indicating that niches of all actors in the system are undifferentiated, although the viruses do not necessarily occupy the full geographic distributions of their hosts. Bat species and rabies viruses share similar niches, and our models had significant predictive power even across unsampled regions; results thus suggest that outbreaks may occur under consistent, stable, and predictable circumstances. Author Summary The situation of rabies in America has been changing: rabies in dogs has decreased considerably, but bats are increasingly documented as natural reservoirs of other rabies variants. A significant gap exists in understanding of bat-borne rabies in Latin America. We identified bat species known to be connected with enzootic rabies with different antigenic variants in Chile, and compiled large-scale data sets by which to test for ecological niche differences among virus lineages and bat hosts. Our results begin to characterize important ecological factors affecting rabies distribution; modeling rabies in Chile allows comparisons across different latitudes and diverse landscapes. We found that rabies virus strains are found in similar environments, regardless of the bat host involved. This research improves understanding of bat-borne rabies dynamics, and important step towards preventing and controlling this and other emergent diseases linked to bats.","2013",NA,"10.1371/journal.pntd.0002577","WOS:000329168100048"

Four temperate grassland sites of low to medium fertility located on a common soil were sampled in winter and summer at two different depths (0-40 cm, 40-80 cm) using a spatially intensive experimental sampling design. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal community composition was determined via the amplification of AMF rRNA gene fragments present in fine roots combined with terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and sequencing analyses. For one out of three endonucleases applied, a site x depth interaction on T-RF richness (S) and Shannon's diversity index (H') was observed, indicating differences between sites in the upper soil layer and depth effects on S and H' for the extensively managed, low fertility site. The S and H' of the AMF taxa present in fine plant roots were marginally lower in winter than in summer (-14% and -16% for S and H', respectively). Evenness E did not vary as a function of site, season or depth. The AMF community profiles, as determined by nonmetric multidimensional scaling, differed between sites and seasons, but not among soil depths. The intersite AMF community variations were attributed to niche differentiation based on soil phosphorus availability and pH. Seasonal shifts could not be related to variations in root densities or physicochemical soil properties measured in this study, suggesting climate and plant regulation as major processes responsible for the variations between winter and summer AMF communities. It is concluded that diverse winter AMF communities are present in temperate grassland soils, and that plant roots colonizing subsoils harbour similar and equally diverse AMF assemblages than those present in topsoil layers.

Despite dominance by a small number of bacteria, AMD microbial biofilm communities contain a notable variety of coexisting and closely related Euryarchaea, most of which have defied cultivation efforts. For this reason, we used metagenomics to analyze variation in gene content that may contribute to niche differentiation among co-occurring AMD archaea. Our analyses targeted members of the Thermoplasmatales and related archaea. These results greatly expand genomic information available for this archaeal order. Results: We reconstructed near-complete genomes for uncultivated, relatively low abundance organisms A-, E-, and Gplasma, members of Thermoplasmatales order, and for a novel organism, Iplasma. Genomic analyses of these organisms, as well as Ferroplasma type I and II, reveal that all are facultative aerobic heterotrophs with the ability to use many of the same carbon substrates, including methanol. Most of the genomes share genes for toxic metal resistance and surface-layer production. Only Aplasma and Eplasma have a full suite of flagellar genes whereas all but the Ferroplasma spp. have genes for pili production. Cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and tomography (cryo-ET) strengthen these metagenomics-based ultrastructural predictions. Notably, only Aplasma, Gplasma and the Ferroplasma spp. have predicted iron oxidation genes and Eplasma and Iplasma lack most genes for cobalamin, valine, (iso)leucine and histidine synthesis. Conclusion: The Thermoplasmatales AMD archaea share a large number of metabolic capabilities. All of the uncultivated organisms studied here (A-, E-, G-, and Iplasma) are metabolically very similar to characterized Ferroplasma spp., differentiating themselves mainly in their genetic capabilities for biosynthesis, motility, and possibly iron oxidation. These results indicate that subtle, but important genomic differences, coupled with unknown differences in gene expression, distinguish these organisms enough to allow for co-existence. Overall this study reveals shared features of organisms from the Thermoplasmatales lineage and provides new insights into the functioning of AMD communities.","2013",NA,"10.1186/1471-2164-14-485","WOS:000322880800001"

As a result, sulfide edifices in the East Pacific Rise, Juan de Fuca Ridge, and Mid Atlantic Ridge vent systems often contain distinct faunal assemblages. In this study, we used high-resolution imagery and in-situ physico-chemical measurements within the context of a Geographic Information System (GIS) to examine community structure and niche differentiation of dominant fauna on sulfide edifices in the Eastern Lau Spreading Center (ELSC) and Valu Fa Ridge (VFR) in the Western Pacific Ocean. Our results show that ELSC and VFR sulfide edifices host two distinct types of communities. One type, that covers the majority of sulfide edifice faces, is overall very similar to nearby lava communities and biomass is dominated by the same chemoautotrophic symbiont-containing molluscs that dominate lava communities, namely the provannid gastropods Alviniconcha spp. and Ifremeria nautilei and the mytilid bivalve Bathymodiolus brevior. The spatial distribution of the dominant molluscs is often a variation of the pattern of concentric rings observed on lavas, with Alviniconcha spp. at the tops of edifices where exposure to vent flow is the highest, and I. nautilei and B. brevior below. Our physico-chemical measurements indicate that because of rapid dispersion of vent fluid, habitable area for symbiont-containing fauna is quite limited on sulfide edifices, and the realized niches of the mollusc groups are narrower on sulfide edifices than on lavas. We suggest that competition plays an important role in determining the realized distributions of the mollusc groups on edifices. The other habitat, present in small patches of presumably hot, new anhydrite, is avoided by the dominant symbiont-containing molluscs and inhabited by crabs, shrimp and polynoids that are likely more heat tolerant. The ratio of sulfide concentration to temperature anomaly of vent fluids was significantly different between sulfide edifice sites and lava sites in the southern vent fields but not in the northern vent fields. We suggest that this is due to increased sulfide consumption by a large microbial consortium associated with the more friable andesitic lava substrates in the south. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In a broiler processing plant the efficacy of using TSP (14%) and CA (5%) applied by immersion and spray was investigated using naturally contaminated carcasses and the effect of these treatments on the sensory attributes of a skin-on (drumstick) and skin-off (fillet) raw and cooked product was assessed using descriptive sensory analysis. In the laboratory, immersion in TSP (14%), LA (5%), CA (5%) and ASC (1200 ppm) significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the Campylobacter counts and a 2.5 to 3 log(10) cfu/cm(2) reduction was observed within the shelf-life (3-5 days) of poultry meat. Spraying was ineffective even after storage. In the broiler processing plant, immersion in TSP (14%) or CA (5%) achieved Campylobacter reductions of 2.49 and 1.44 log(10) cfu/cm(2), respectively.

Quality factors of nuts include: color; texture (crispness), which is related to degree of dryness (moisture content); and flavor (oiliness, sweetness, absence of off-flavors due to development of staleness and rancidity). Deterioration rate is influenced by moisture content, incidence of decay-causing fungi, and insect damage. A safe moisture level for nuts is a water activity below 0.7 at 25 degrees C to retard microbial growth. Nuts in the shell have longer storage potential than shelled nuts. Broken pieces are more perishable than halves or whole kernels. Storage potential depends upon the moisture content of the nuts, and temperature, relative humidity and oxygen (O-2) concentration during storage. Effective control of stored-product insects and packaging in insect-proof packages to prevent insect re-infestation are critical to the preservation of nut quality and quantity. Low O-2 (less than 0.5%) is a beneficial supplement to proper temperature management to maintain flavor quality and insect control. Exclusion of O-2 is usually done by vacuum packaging or by nitrogen flushing of the package. The optimal range of storage temperatures is 0-10 degrees C; the lower the temperature the longer the storage life. Some nut products can be stored frozen at -18 degrees C for a year or longer and remain in good condition. The optimal relative humidity range is 55-70%, depending on the original moisture content of the product.","2013",NA,"10.1533/9780857097484.1.22","WOS:000340136300003"

Bud2p, which functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Bud1p/Rsr1p, is required for appropriate budding patterns and filamentous growth. The regulatory mechanisms leading to Bud2p activation, however, are poorly understood. In this study, we report that ADP-ribosylation factor 3p (Arf3p) acts as a regulator of Bud2p activation during invasive growth. Arf3p binds directly to the N-terminal region of Bud2p and promotes its GAP activity both in vitro and in vivo. Genetic analysis shows that deletion of BUD1 suppresses the defect of invasive growth in arf3 Delta or bud2 Delta cells. Lack of Arf3p, like that of Bud2p, causes the intracellular accumulation of Bud1p-GTP. The Arf3p-Bud2p interaction is important for invasive growth and facilitates the Bud2p-Bud1p association in vivo. Finally, we show that under glucose depletion-induced invasion conditions in yeast, more Arf3p is activated to the GTP-bound state, and the activation is independent of Arf3p guanine nucleotide-exchange factor Yel1p. Thus we demonstrate that a novel spatial activation of Arf3p plays a role in regulating Bud2p activation during glucose depletion-induced invasive growth.","2013",NA,"10.1091/mbc.E13-03-0136","WOS:000322736800005"

We show that invasions by knapweed (Centaurea stoebe) and leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula, hereafter spurge)-but not cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum)-support a higher abundance and diversity of symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) than multi-species native plant communities. The higher AMF richness associated with knapweed and spurge is unlikely due to a co-invasion by AMF, because a separate sampling showed that individual native forbs hosted a similar AMF abundance and richness as exotic forbs. Native grasses associated with fewer AMF taxa, which could explain the reduced AMF richness in native, grass-dominated communities. The three invasive plant species harbored distinct AMF communities, and analyses of co-occurring native and invasive plants indicate that differences were partly driven by the invasive plants and were not the result of pre-invasion conditions. Our results suggest that invasions by mycotrophic plants that replace poorer hosts can increase AMF abundance and richness. The high AMF richness in monodominant plant invasions also indicates that the proposed positive relationship between above and belowground diversity is not always strong. Finally, the disparate responses among exotic plants and consistent results between grasses and forbs suggest that AMF respond more to plant functional group than plant provenance.","2013",NA,"10.1038/ismej.2013.41","WOS:000320852100017"
"Addison, AL; Powell, JA; Six, DL; Moore, M; Bentz, BJ","The role of temperature variability in stabilizing the mountain pine beetle-fungus mutualism","JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY","As global climate patterns continue to change and extreme weather events become increasingly common, it is likely that many ecological interactions will be affected. One such interaction is the multipartite symbiosis that exists between the mountain pine beetle and two species of fungi, Grosmannia clavigera and Ophiostoma montium. In this mutualism, the fungi provide nutrition to the beetle, while the fungi benefit by being dispersed to new host trees. Multi-partite mutualisms are predicted to be unstable due to strong direct competition among symbionts or natural selection for superior over inferior mutualists. However, this mutualism has remained stable over long periods of evolutionary time. In this paper, we developed a temperature-based model for the spread of fungi within a tree and connected it to an existing model for mountain pine beetle development. Using this integrated model for fungal growth, we explored the possibility that temperature variability is a stabilizing mechanism for the mountain pine beetle fungi mutualism. Of the three types of temperature variability we tested: intra-year, inter-year and variability due to transitioning between different thermal habitats (thermal migration), we found that thermal migration was the most robust stabilizing mechanism. Additionally, we found that the MPB attack density or spacing between fungal lesions also had a significant effect on the stability of the system. High attack densities or close lesion spacings also tended to stabilize the system, regardless of temperature. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Wave-resistant algal rims, predominantly made up of the crustose coralline algae (CCA) Porolithon onkodes and P. pachydermum(1,2), are therefore critical structural elements for the survival of many shallow coral reefs. Concerns are growing about the susceptibility of CCA to ocean acidification because CCA Mg-calcite skeletons are more susceptible to dissolution under low pH conditions than coral aragonite skeletons(3). However, the recent discovery(4) of dolomite (Mg0.5Ca0.5(CO3)), a stable carbonate(5), in P. onkodes cells necessitates a reappraisal of the impacts of ocean acidification on these CCA. Here we show, using a dissolution experiment, that dried dolomite-rich CCA have 6-10 times lower rates of dissolution than predominantly Mg-calcite CCA in both high-CO2 (similar to 700 ppm) and control (similar to 380 ppm) environments, respectively. We reveal this stabilizing mechanism to be a combination of reduced porosity due to dolomite infilling and selective dissolution of other carbonate minerals. Physical break-up proceeds by dissolution of Mg-calcite walls until the dolomitized cell eventually drops out intact. Dolomite-rich CCA frameworks are common in shallow coral reefs globally and our results suggest that it is likely that they will continue to provide protection and stability for coral reef frameworks as CO2 rises.","2013",NA,"10.1038/NCLIMATE1760","WOS:000319399000023"

In a previous study by Serno et al. (Pharm. Res. 30 (2013) 117), we could refute the first hypothesis by proving that, although HP beta CD is slightly surface active, it does not displace the antibody at the air-water interface, and accordingly, its surface activity is not the underlying stabilizing mechanism. In the present study, we investigated the possibility of interactions between HP beta CD and monoclonal antibodies as the potential stabilization mechanism using quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and static as well as dynamic light scattering. In the presence of HP beta CD, the adsorption of IgG antibodies in the native state (IgG A) and the unfolded state (IgG A and IgG B) on gold-coated quartz crystals was studied by QCM. Results show that HP beta CD causes a reduction in protein adsorption in both the folded and the unfolded states, probably due to an interaction between the protein and the cyclodextrin, leading to a reduced hydrophobicity of the protein and consequently a lower extent of adsorption. These results were supported by investigation of the interaction between the native protein and HP beta CD using static and dynamic light scattering experiments, which provide the protein-protein interaction parameters, B22 and k0, respectively. Both B22 and ki) showed an increase in magnitude with increasing HP beta CD-concentrations, indicating a rise in net repulsive forces between the protein molecules.

In conclusion, this study provides evidence that the previously observed stabilizing effect of HP beta CD on IgG antibodies is probably due to direct interactions between the cyclodextrin and the protein.

Competition is thought to reduce diversity, but hundreds of microbial aquatic primary producers species coexist and compete for a few essential resources (e.g., nutrients and light). Here, we show that resource competition is a plausible mechanism for explaining clumpy distribution on individual species volume (a proxy for the niche) of estuarine phytoplankton communities ranging from North America to South America and Europe, supporting the Emergent Neutrality hypothesis. Furthermore, such a clumpy distribution was also observed throughout the Holocene in diatoms from a sediment core. A Lotka-Volterra competition model predicted position in the niche axis and functional affiliation of dominant species within and among clumps. Results support the coexistence of functionally equivalent species in ecosystems and indicate that resource competition may be a key process to shape the size structure of estuarine phytoplankton, which in turn drives ecosystem functioning.","2013",NA,"10.1038/srep01037","WOS:000313276600003"

Despite the pervasive nature of glacial ice both today and in Earth's past and the potential contribution of these systems to global biogeochemical cycles, the composition and phylogenetic structure of an active microbial community in subglacial systems has yet to be described. Here, using RNA-based approaches, we demonstrate the presence of active and endogenous archaeal, bacterial and eukaryal assemblages in cold (0-1 degrees C) subglacial sediments sampled from Robertson Glacier, Alberta, Canada. Patterns in the phylogenetic structure and composition of subglacial sediment small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) assemblages indicate greater diversity and evenness than in glacial surface environments, possibly due to facilitative or competitive interactions among populations in the subglacial environment. The combination of phylogenetically more even and more diverse assemblages in the subglacial environment suggests minimal niche overlap and optimization to capture a wider spectrum of the limited nutrients and chemical energy made available from weathering of bedrock minerals. The prevalence of SSU rRNA affiliated with lithoautotrophic bacteria, autotrophic methane producing archaea and heterotrophic eukarya in the subglacial environment is consistent with this hypothesis and suggests an active contribution to the global carbon cycle. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that subglacial environments harbor endogenous active ecosystems that have the potential to impact global biogeochemical cycles over extended periods of time.","2013",NA,"10.1038/ismej.2013.31","WOS:000320852100015"

Besides this, it is already widespread over the globe, and one of the possible carriers is believed to be the American bullfrog. In order to assess whether the successful establishment of invasive bullfrog populations is associated with environmental suitability for Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), we evaluated the close linkage between the fungus (Bd) and bullfrogs by measuring their environmental niche overlap. Our results indicate that Bd and bullfrogs largely overlap in their realized niches, wherein Bd occupies a larger climate space in which the bullfrogs' niche is nested. Therefore, our results strengthen the bullfrog carrier hypothesis. Besides this, we suggest that Bd can colonize areas adjacent to the bullfrogs' realized niche, infecting other species of native wild frogs.

However, while subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics (SICA) are known to shift bacterial gene expression, specific hypotheses as to how SICA influence the ecology of natural populations are scarce. We explored whether antibiotic 'signals', or SICA, have the potential to alter nutrient utilization, niche overlap, and competitive species interactions among Streptomyces populations in soil. For nine diverse Streptomyces isolates, we evaluated nutrient utilization patterns on 95 different nutrient sources in the presence and absence of subinhibitory concentrations of five antibiotics. There were significant changes in nutrient use among Streptomyces isolates, including both increases and decreases in the capacity to use individual nutrients in the presence vs. in the absence of SICA. Isolates varied in their responses to SICA and antibiotics varied in their effects on isolates. Furthermore, for some isolate-isolate-antibiotic combinations, competition-free growth (growth for an isolate on all nutrients that were not utilized by a competing isolate), was increased in the presence of SICA, reducing the potential fitness cost of nutrient competition among those competitors. This suggests that antibiotics may provide a mechanism for bacteria to actively minimize niche overlap among competitors in soil. Thus, in contrast to antagonistic coevolutionary dynamics, antibiotics as signals may mediate coevolutionary displacement among coexisting Streptomyces, thereby hindering the emergence of antibiotic resistant phenotypes. These results contribute to our broad understanding of the ecology and evolutionary biology of antibiotics and microbial signals in nature.","2013",NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0081064","WOS:000328566100031"

Both temperature and a(w) and their interactions had a significant influence on the growth and nutritional utilisation patterns (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences between toxigenic and atoxigenic strains in terms of lag phase prior to growth and mycelial growth rates. Based on carbon source (CS) utilisation patterns, toxigenic and atoxigenic strains' niche size was greater at higher temperatures and in wetter conditions. Additionally, based on niche overlap indices (NOIs), regardless of temperature, when water was freely available, atoxigenic and toxigenic strains co-existed. However, under moisture stress, the nutritional competitiveness was variable. Temporal carbon utilisation sequences (TCUS) of toxigenic and atoxigenic strains were compared. At 0.99 a(w) most CS sources were utilised by the strains and the time to detection (TTD) of each strain was shortest on monosaccharides at the same level of a(w). Conversely, under moisture stress the least number of CS was utilised. The current study has demonstrated that carbon utilisation patterns are equally important as are other determinants of competitiveness and that growth rate alone is not a key attribute which determines competitiveness.

Models of coexistence often assume that species have fixed trait values and consider questions such as how tradeoffs and environmental variation influence coexistence and diversity. However, species traits can be dynamic, varying between populations and individuals and changing over time as species adapt and evolve, at rates that are relevant to ecological processes. Consequently, adding evolution to ecological coexistence models may modify their predictions and stability in complex or unexpected ways. We extend a well-studied coexistence mechanism depending on resource fluctuations by allowing evolution along a tradeoff between maximum growth rate and competitive ability. Interactions between favorable season length and the period of fluctuations constrain coexistence, with two species coexistence favored by intermediate season length and arising through evolutionary branching or non-local invasion. However, these results depend on the relative rates of ecological and evolutionary processes: rapid evolution leads to a complete breakdown of otherwise stable coexistence. Other coexistence mechanisms should be evaluated from an evolutionary perspective to examine how evolutionary forces may alter predicted ecological dynamics. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"Rudolf, VHW; Rasmussen, NL","Ontogenetic functional diversity: Size structure of a keystone predator drives functioning of a complex ecosystem","ECOLOGY","A central challenge in community ecology is to understand the connection between biodiversity and the functioning of ecosystems. While traditional approaches have largely focused on species-level diversity, increasing evidence indicates that there exists substantial ecological diversity among individuals within species. By far, the largest source of this intraspecific diversity stems from variation among individuals in ontogenetic stage and size. Although such ontogenetic shifts are ubiquitous in natural communities, whether and how they scale up to influence the structure and functioning of complex ecosystems is largely unknown. Here we take an experimental approach to examine the consequences of ontogenetic niche shifts for the structure of communities and ecosystem processes. In particular we experimentally manipulated the stage structure in a keystone predator, larvae of the dragonfly Anax junius, in complex experimental pond communities to test whether changes in the population stage or size structure of a keystone species scale up to alter community structure and ecosystem processes, and how functional differences scale with relative differences in size among stages. We found that the functional role of A. junius was stage-specific. Altering what stages were present in a pond led to concurrent changes in community structure, primary producer biomass (periphyton and phytoplankton), and ultimately altered ecosystem processes (respiration and net primary productivity), indicating a strong, but stage-specific, trophic cascade. Interestingly, the stage-specific effects did not simply scale with size or biomass of the predator, but instead indicated clear ontogenetic niche shifts in ecological interactions. Thus, functional differences among stages within a keystone species scaled up to alter the functioning of entire ecosystems. Therefore, our results indicate that the classical approach of assuming an average functional role of a species can be misleading because functional roles are dynamic and will change with shifts in the stage structure of the species. In general this emphasizes the importance of accounting for functional diversity below the species level to predict how natural and anthropogenic changes alter the functioning of natural ecosystems.","2013",NA,"10.1890/12-0378.1","WOS:000318969800007"

Resource quality and availability also influence prey trophic behaviour, with potential effects on predator-prey dynamics. Although many studies have addressed these topics, little attention has been paid to the combined effects of predators and resources on prey species coexistence and nutrient transfer along food chains, especially in detritus-based systems. To determine the influence of predators and resource quality on the movement and P uptake of detritivores, we carried out a field experiment on the River Kelvin (Scotland) using P-32 to test the hypothesis of reduced prey vagility among resource patches as a strategy to avoid predation. Thirty leaf sacks containing alder leaves and two detritivore prey populations (Asellus aquaticus and Lymnaea peregra) were placed in cages, half of them with two predator species (Dendrocoelum lacteum and Erpobdella octoculata) and the other half without predators. Five alder leaf bags, each individually inoculated with a different fungus strain to simulate a patchy habitat, were placed inside each leaf sack. One bag in each sack was labelled with P-32, in order to assess the proportion of detritivores using it as food and thus their movement among the five resource patches. Three replicates for each labelled fungus and each predation treatment (i.e. with and without predators) were left on the riverbed for 7 days. The presence of predators had negligible effects on the number of detritivores in the leaf bags, but it did reduce the proportion of P-32-labelled detritivores and their P uptake. The most strongly affected species was A. aquaticus, whose vagility, trophic overlap with L. peregra and P uptake were all reduced. The results confirm the importance of bottom-up and top-down forces acting simultaneously to regulate nutrient transfer along food chains in patchy habitats.","2013",NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0065186","WOS:000319961900044"

Here, we used, for the first time, climate-based ecological niche models (ENMs) to test hypotheses about ecological divergence and speciation processes between sister species pairs of lemurs (genus Eulemur) in Madagascar. We produced ENMs for eight species, all of which had significant validation support. Among the four sister species pairs, we found nonequivalent niches between sisters, varying degrees of niche overlap in ecological and geographic space, and support for multiple divergence processes. Specifically, three sister-pair comparisons supported the null model that niches are no more divergent than the available background region. These findings are consistent with an allopatric speciation model, and for two sister pairs (E.collaris-E.cinereiceps and E.rufus-E.rufifrons), a riverine barrier has been previously proposed for driving allopatric speciation. However, for the fourth sister pair E.flavifrons-E.macaco, we found support for significant niche divergence, and consistent with their parapatric distribution on an ecotone and the lack of obvious geographic barriers, these findings most strongly support a parapatric model of speciation.

Ecologists have recognized the potentially important role of temporal niche in promoting species coexistence and diversity, yet little is known about how temporal niche affects the evolution of biodiversity. Here we show that temporal niche strongly influences biodiversity dynamics in rapidly evolving bacteria. An ancestral bacterium quickly diversifies when provided with constant spatial niche opportunities or when experiencing temporal niche dynamics. However, only in communities with temporal niches, which promote frequency-dependent selection and the positive growth of new mutants, is the accumulated phenotypic diversity able to persist. Overall, the presence of temporal niche opportunities eliminates the overshooting dynamics of adaptive radiation typically seen in this and other systems.

Great Salt Lake (GSL) in Utah exhibits strong spatial gradients due to both seasonal variation in freshwater input into the watershed and restricted fluid flow within North America's largest saline terminal lake ecosystem. Here, we examine the phylogenetic structure and composition of archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryal small subunit (SSU) rRNA genes sampled along a stratified water column (DWR3) in the south arm of GSL in order to infer the underlying mechanism of community assembly. Communities sampled from the DWR3 epilimnion were phylogenetically clustered (i.e., coexistence of close relatives due to environmental filtering) whereas those sampled from the DWR3 hypolimnion were phylogenetically overdispersed (i.e., coexistence of distant relatives due to competitive interactions), with minimal evidence for a role for neutral processes in structuring any assemblage. The shift from phylogenetically clustered to overdispersed assemblages was associated with an increase in salinity and a decrease in dissolved O-2 (DO) concentration. Likewise, the phylogenetic diversity and phylogenetic similarity of assemblages was strongly associated with salinity or DO gradients. Thus, salinity and/or DO appeared to influence the mechanism of community assembly as well as the phylogenetic diversity and composition of communities. It is proposed that the observed patterns in the phylogenetic composition and structure of DWR3 assemblages are attributable to the meromictic nature of GSL, which prevents significant mixing between the epilimnion and the hypolimnion. This leads to strong physicochemical gradients at the halocline, which are capable of supporting a greater diversity. However, concomitant shifts in nutrient availability (e.g., DO) at and below the halocline drive competitive interactions leading to hypolimnion assemblages with minimal niche overlap.","2013",NA,"10.1007/s00248-013-0180-9","WOS:000321668900003"

Fungal species frequency and occurrence during trophic succession on a natural resource were studied and used as a tool to gain a better understanding of the metabolic profiles obtained in vitro, thus permitting clarification of the role played by some of the key fungal species involved in the decomposition process within a Mediterranean natural ecosystem. Litter bags containing pure (homogeneous) and mixed leaves of low maquis plant species were incubated for one year in a field experiment. Functional diversity of a representative pool of fungal communities was analysed and compared using a phenotype microarray technique. Taking as its basis the screening of metabolic profiles using culturable isolates, this investigation showed that there was a high potentiality of functional redundancy between low, intermediate and high frequency taxa, and potential niche overlap during the different phases that occur during leaf litter decomposition. The early stages of decomposition appeared to be characterized by the presence of rare taxa (Low species), with a significantly higher functional potential, especially for sugar compounds. Conversely, the later phases of decomposition appeared to be characterized by species of intermediate frequency, while rare taxa at these stages seem to lose their dominant role. The importance of the different groups of substrates found across the decomposition phases also represented a key factor. For example, redundancy in the utilization of N-related compounds indicated a high potential for overlapping between species, especially in the early phases of the decomposition process, suggesting that the capacity for interspecific competition on some substrates can be considerable, particularly at the start of substrate exploitation.

These specialisations define how a species interacts with its environment and, by extension, determine its functional role. Here, we examine the feeding niche of three species of coral reef-dwelling rabbitfishes (Siganidae, Siganus). By comparing aspects of their feeding behaviour (bite location, bite rate, foraging distance) with that of representative species from two other abundant herbivorous fish families, the parrotfishes (Labridae, Scarus) and surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae, Acanthurus), we examine whether rabbitfishes have a feeding niche distinct from other members of the herbivore guild. Measurements of the penetration of the fishes' snouts and bodies into reef concavities when feeding revealed that rabbitfish fed to a greater degree from reef crevices and interstices than other herbivores. There was just a 40 % overlap in the penetration-depth niche between rabbitfish and surgeonfish and a 45 % overlap between rabbitfish and parrotfish, compared with the almost complete niche overlap (95 %) recorded for parrotfish and surgeonfish along this spatial niche axis. Aspects of the morphology of rabbitfish which may contribute to this niche segregation include a comparatively longer, narrower snout and narrower head. Our results suggest that sympatric coexistence of rabbitfish and other reef herbivores is facilitated by segregation along a spatial (and potentially dietary) axis. This segregation results in a unique functional role for rabbitfishes among roving herbivores that of crevice-browser: a group that specifically feeds on crevice-dwelling algal or benthic organisms. This functional trait may have implications for reef ecosystem processes in terms of controlling the successional development of crevice-based algal communities, reducing their potential to trigger macroalgal outbreaks.","2013",NA,"10.1007/s00338-012-0945-5","WOS:000316018600002"

Enzyme activities associated with nitrogen cycling and microbial biomass were measured in all rhizosphere and bulk soils. Both enzyme activities and microbial biomass in the rhizosphere differed significantly tree compositions. Microbial biomass contents were more sensitive to the changes of the rhizosphere environment than enzyme activities. Tree species coexistence did not consistently increase tested enzyme activities and microbial biomass, but varied depending on the complementarities of species traits. In general, impacts of tree species and coexistence were more pronounced on microbial composition than total biomass, evidenced by differences in microbial biomass C/N ratios stratified across the rhizosphere soils. Compared to poplar clone monoculture, other tree species addition obviously increased rhizosphere urease activity, but greatly reduced rhizosphere L-asparaginase activity.

Sampling was conducted during the austral spring and summer of 2007 and 2008, respectively. The shallow subtidal habitat is mainly characterized by the abundance of two types of habitat: foliose algae and encrusting invertebrates. Diet and trophic characteristic of fishes were obtained by volumetric contribution and frequency of occurrence of each prey item. Of the five species studied, one is herbivorous (juvenile Scorpis chilensis), four are omnivores (Nemadactylus gayi, Malapterus reticulatus, Pseudocaranx chilensis and Scorpis chilensis adult), and one carnivore (Hypoplectrodes semicinctum). The dietary diversity index was relatively low compared to other temperate reef systems, which could indicate a low availability of prey items for coastal fishes. The morphological parameters indicated that cranial structures and pairs of pectoral fins influence the foraging behaviour. Differences in fin aspect ratio among species provided insight about fish depth distribution and feeding behaviour. These results suggest important adaptive changes in the depth gradient of fishes in the subtidal environments of this island.

The studies focused on the foliar functional traits, plant regeneration patterns, biogeochemical cycles, soil microbial biomass and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal diversity associated with the co-dominant evergreen Quercus suber and deciduous Quercus canariensis in a Mediterranean forest in southern Spain. Foliar attributes differed between oak species, with Q canariensis having higher nutrient content and lower carbon to nutrient ratios and leaf mass per area than Q. suber. These attributes reflected their distinct resource use strategies and adaptation to high and low resource-availability environments, respectively. Leaf-fall nutrient concentrations were higher in Q. canariensis than in Q. suber and were correlated with concentrations in the fresh leaves. Leaf-fall nutrient concentrations influenced nutrient return, leaf-fall decay rate and the proportion of nutrients released from decomposing leaf-fall, all of which were higher for Q canariensis than for Q. suber. This generated a differential net nutrient input into the soil that led to increased soil nutrient concentrations under the canopy of Q. canariensis as compared to Q suber. The fraction of slowly decomposing leaf-fall that builds up soil organic matter was higher for Q canariensis, further raising the nutrient and moisture retention of its soils. Differences between species in soil properties disappeared with increasing soil depth, which was consistent with the hypothesised leaf-fall-mediated effect. Tree-species-generated changes in soil properties had further impacts on soil organisms. Soil microbial biomass (Cmic) and nutrients (Nmic, Pmic) were higher under Q. canariensis than under Q sober and were positively related to soil moisture content and substrate availability (particularly soil N). The composition of the ECM fungal community shifted between the two oaks in response to changes in the soil properties, particularly soil Ca and pH. Lower ECM phylogenetic diversity and higher abundance of mycorrhizal species with saprophytic abilities were related to the greater soil fertility under Q. canariensis. Overall, the two oak species generated soil conditions that aligned with their resource-use strategies and would enhance their own competitive capabilities, potentially creating a positive feedback. The two Quercus created soil spatial heterogeneity that could enable their coexistence through spatial niche partitioning.

"Nelson, EB; Karp, MA","Soil pathogen communities associated with native and non-native Phragmites australis populations in freshwater wetlands","ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","Soil pathogens are believed to be major contributors to negative plant-soil feedbacks that regulate plant community dynamics and plant invasions. While the theoretical basis for pathogen regulation of plant communities is well established within the plant-soil feedback framework, direct experimental evidence for pathogen community responses to plants has been limited, often relying largely on indirect evidence based on above-ground plant responses. As a result, specific soil pathogen responses accompanying above-ground plant community dynamics are largely unknown. Here, we examine the oomycete pathogens in soils conditioned by established populations of native noninvasive and non-native invasive haplotypes of Phragmites australis (European common reed). Our aim was to assess whether populations of invasive plants harbor unique communities of pathogens that differ from those associated with noninvasive populations and whether the distribution of taxa within these communities may help to explain invasive success. We compared the composition and abundance of pathogenic and saprobic oomycete species over a 2-year period. Despite a diversity of oomycete taxa detected in soils from both native and non-native populations, pathogen communities from both invaded and noninvaded soils were dominated by species of Pythium. Pathogen species that contributed the most to the differences observed between invaded and noninvaded soils were distributed between invaded and noninvaded soils. However, the specific taxa in invaded soils responsible for community differences were distinct from those in noninvaded soils that contributed to community differences. Our results indicate that, despite the phylogenetic relatedness of native and non-native P.australis haplotypes, pathogen communities associated with the dominant non-native haplotype are distinct from those of the rare native haplotype. Pathogen taxa that dominate either noninvaded or invaded soils suggest different potential mechanisms of invasion facilitation. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that non-native plant species that dominate landscapes may cultivate a different soil pathogen community to their rhizosphere than those of rarer native species.","2013",NA,"10.1002/ece3.900","WOS:000328672600011"

Plant species can influence soil biota, which in turn can influence the relative performance of plant species. These plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) have been hypothesized to affect many community-level dynamics including species coexistence, dominance and invasion. 2. The importance of PSFs in exotic species invasion, although widely hypothesized, has been difficult to determine because invader establishment necessarily precedes invader-mediated PSFs. Here, we combine a spatial simulation model of invasion that incorporates PSFs with a meta-analysis that synthesizes published case studies describing feedbacks between pairs of native and exotic species. 3. While our spatial model confirmed the link between positive soil feedbacks ('home' advantage) for exotic species and exotic species spread, results were dependent on the initial abundance of the exotic species and the equivalence of dispersal and life history characteristics between exotic and native species. 4. The meta-analysis of 52 native-exotic pairwise feedback comparisons in 22 studies synthesized measures of native and exotic performance in soils conditioned by native and exotic species. The analysis indicated that the growth responses of native species were often greater in soil conditioned by native species than in soil conditioned exotic species (a 'home' advantage). The growth responses of exotic species were variable and not consistently related to species soil-conditioning effects. 5. Synthesis. Overlaying empirical estimates of pairwise PSFs with spatial simulations, we conclude that the empirically measured PSFs between native and exotic plant species are often not consistent with predictions of the spread of exotic species and mono-dominance. This is particularly the case when exotic species are initially rare and share similar dispersal and average fitness characteristics with native species. However, disturbance and other processes that increase the abundance of exotic species as well as the inclusion of species dispersal and life history differences can interact with PSF effects to explain the spread of invasive species.","2013",NA,"10.1111/1365-2745.12057","WOS:000317923300004"
"Queenborough, SA; Metz, MR; Valencia, R; Wright, SJ","Demographic consequences of chromatic leaf defence in tropical tree communities: do red young leaves increase growth and survival?","ANNALS OF BOTANY","Many tropical forest tree species delay greening their leaves until full expansion. This strategy is thought to provide newly flushing leaves with protection against damage by herbivores by keeping young leaves devoid of nutritive value. Because young leaves suffer the greatest predation from invertebrate herbivores, delayed greening could prevent costly tissue loss. Many species that delay greening also produce anthocyanin pigments in their new leaves, giving them a reddish tint. These anthocyanins may be fungicidal, protect leaves against UV damage or make leaves cryptic to herbivores blind to the red part of the spectrum. A comprehensive survey was undertaken of seedlings, saplings and mature trees in two diverse tropical forests: a rain forest in western Amazonia (Yasun National Park, Ecuador) and a deciduous forest in Central America (Barro Colorado Island, Panam). A test was made of whether individuals and species with delayed greening or red-coloured young leaves showed lower mortality or higher relative growth rates than species that did not. At both Yasun and Barro Colorado Island, species with delayed greening or red young leaves comprised significant proportions of the seedling and tree communities. At both sites, significantly lower mortality was found in seedlings and trees with delayed greening and red-coloured young leaves. While there was little effect of leaf colour on the production of new leaves of seedlings, diameter relative growth rates of small trees were lower in species with delayed greening and red-coloured young leaves than in species with regular green leaves, and this effect remained when the trade-off between mortality and growth was accounted for. Herbivores exert strong selection pressure on seedlings for the expression of defence traits. A delayed greening or red-coloured young leaf strategy in seedlings appears to be associated with higher survival for a given growth rate, and may thus influence the species composition of later life stages.","2013",NA,"10.1093/aob/mct144","WOS:000322952500005"

These plant communities evolved as a result of a long history of human activity, which generated and maintained these habitats by extensive grazing and mowing. Calcareous grasslands are listed as a priority for conservation in the EC Habitats Directive. However, the effects of different management regimes, nitrogen enrichment, and soil-borne pathogens on plant species diversity are less clear for grasslands of the Mediterranean Basin, compared to meadows in Northern and Central Europe. In this study, we assessed the impact of land abandonment, nitrogen enrichment, and fairy-ring fungi on species diversity in semi-natural grasslands found in the Mediterranean Basin by comparing the available literature with findings from recent studies carried out in Central Italy. In a series of field experiments, the cutting of abandoned grassland consistently reduced the living biomass of the dominant perennial grasses, such as Brachypodium rupestre and Bromus erectus, and promoted a rapid increase in species richness and diversity by allowing the establishment of rare species. There was a similar, but less effective, restoration of species diversity and composition in mowed grassland after litter removal. We also show that nitrogen enrichment at levels comparable to atmospheric deposition depresses species diversity, which also hampers the positive effects of litter removal. Our findings are consistent with previous results achieved in Northern and Central Europe, which however, mainly focused on grasslands with intermediate to high primary productivity levels. The limited availability of data from low-productivity, drought-prone Mediterranean grasslands requires further studies to assess the impact of land abandonment and nitrogen eutrophication in such ecosystems. Finally, we discuss the role of fairy-ring fungi in the maintenance of plant diversity in species-rich grassland. We show that fairy-ring fungi (e.g. Agaricus campestris) critically affect the spatial distribution and diversity of coexisting plant species. By killing the dominant perennial herbs, these radially growing plant pathogens produce empty niches for rare, short-lived species, thus affecting the vegetation pattern. Overall, our results are of interest for environmental managers, as they provide guidelines for the restoration of abandoned areas and the conservation of these species-rich habitats.","2013",NA,"10.1007/s10531-013-0502-8","WOS:000323655100011"
"Norghauer, JM; Newbery, DM","Herbivores equalize the seedling height growth of three dominant tree species in an African tropical rain forest","FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT","Determining the impact of insect herbivores on forest tree seedlings and saplings is difficult without experimentation in the field. Moreover, this impact may be heterogeneous in time and space because of seasonal rainfall and canopy disturbances, or 'gaps', which can influence both insect abundance and plant performance. In this study we used fine netting to individually protect seedlings of Microberlinia bisulcata, Tetraberlinia bifoliolata and Tetraberlinia korupensis trees (Fabaceae = Leguminosae) from insects in 41 paired gap-understorey locations across 80 ha of primary rain forest (Korup, Cameroon). For all species, growth in height and leaf numbers was negligible in the understorey, where M. bisulcata had the lowest survival after c. 2 years. In gaps, however, all species responded positively with pronounced above-ground growth across seasons. When exposed to herbivores their seedling height growth was similar, but in the absence of herbivores, M. bisulcata significantly outgrew both Tetraberlinia species and matched their leaf numbers. This result suggests that insect herbivores might play an important role in maintaining species coexistence by mitigating sapling abundance of the more palatable M. bisulcata, which in gaps was eaten the most severely. The higher ratio in static leaf damage of control-to-caged M. bisulcata seedlings in gaps than understorey locations was consistent with the Plant Vigour Hypothesis. This result, however, did not apply to either Tetraberlinia species. For M. bisulcata and T. korupensis, but not T. bifoliolata (the most shade-tolerant species), caging improved relative seedling survival in the understory locations compared to gaps, providing restricted support for the Limiting Resource Model. Approximately 2.25 years after treatments were removed, the caged seedlings were taller and had more leaves than controls in all three species, and the effect remained strongest for M. bisulcata. We conclude that in this community the impact of leaf herbivory on seedling growth in gaps is strong for the dominant M. bisulcata, which coupled to a very low shade-tolerance contributes to limiting its regeneration. However, because gaps are common to most forests, insect herbivores may be having impacts upon functionally similar tree species that are also characterized by low sapling recruitment much more widely than currently appreciated. An implication for the restoration and management of M. bisulcata populations in forests outside of Korup is that physical protection from herbivores of new seedlings where the canopy is opened by gaps, or by harvesting, should substantially increase its subcanopy regeneration, and thus, too, its opportunities for adult recruitment.

We tested whether the phylogenetic distances between species of green freshwater algae determined their abilities to coexist in a microcosm experiment.

"Gibert, A; Hazard, L","Genetically based vertical transmission drives the frequency of the symbiosis between grasses and systemic fungal endophytes","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY","Understanding the variation in hereditary symbiont frequency among host populations is a prerequisite to predict symbiont fixation processes. However, the mechanisms driving this variation remain elusive. Exploring the mechanisms responsible for the observed variability on an ecological time scale requires simultaneous study of fitness differentials between symbiotic (S) and non-symbiotic (NS) hosts, and the symbiont transmission rates to host offspring. We studied these two key mechanisms using a grassendophyte symbiosis in the alpine grass Festuca eskia. Plants from four native populations varying in endophyte frequencies (ranging from 13% to 100%), and environmental conditions (water availability, and grazing pressure) were transplanted in a common garden. Soil nutrient levels were manipulated to assess genetic and environmental differences within and among populations in fitness-related traits (i.e. traits linked to clonal growth, sexual reproduction and resource acquisition). A fitness differential favouring S over NS plants was detected in all studied populations: in heavily grazed populations, sexual reproduction was higher in S compared with NS plants, whereas in minimally grazed populations, clonal growth increased. Results showed a positive correlation between endophyte transmission rates and population endophyte symbiotic frequencies. The population endophyte transmission rates were not affected by soil resource level. According to selection pressures acting in each population, symbiotic plants appear to perform better in all F.eskia populations. The correlation between endophyte frequencies and transmission, and the positive effect of S on NS plants under our experimental conditions, indicated a predominant role of endophyte transmission in endophyte frequency variation in F.eskia. The endophyte transmission rate variation is genetically based at the population level and can be explained by a trade-off with a specific host trait subjected to strong selection; here, we suspected traits linked to plant resource acquisition. Synthesis: Our study provides evidence for the (i) dominant role of endophyte transmission and its responsibility for endophyte frequency variation in a native grass when compared with fitness differential process between S and NS plants at an ecological time scale, and (ii) genetically based variation in endophyte transmission rates. We also confirm the population specificity of positive endophyte effects in a native grass.","2013",NA,"10.1111/1365-2745.12073","WOS:000318186800020"

Although the potential for pathogen spillover is widespread, its consequences for host community composition remain poorly understood. To address this gap, I examine the consequences of fungal seed pathogen spillover from an exotic annual grass (cheatgrass) to a native perennial bunchgrass in the Intermountain West, United States, using a model. Integrating generalist pathogens with broader coexistence theory, the model measures the pathogen's effect on host niche differences and fitness differences, which determine the outcome of competition. The model demonstrates that the consequences of pathogen spillover depend on host differences in species-specific transmission and disease tolerance. Counterintuitively, spillover can lead to coexistence, native grass exclusion, or priority effects, in which either species can exclude the other when initially more dominant. Cheatgrass has higher tolerance for infection, which could lead to competitive dominance or to coexistence if the native grass has a fecundity or survival advantage. In sum, multihost pathogens can affect host communities in a range of ways, depending on the specific mechanism of spillover.","2013",NA,"10.1086/670190","WOS:000318996500004"

The rise of mutator alleles is understood as a result of their hitchhiking with linked beneficial mutations, although the factors that govern this process remain unclear. A prominent but underappreciated fact is that each mutator allele increases only a specific spectrum of mutational changes. This spectrum has been speculated to alter the distribution of fitness effects of beneficial mutations, potentially affecting hitchhiking. To study this possibility, we analyzed the fitness distribution of beneficial mutations generated from different mutator and wild-type Escherichia coli strains. Using antibiotic resistance as a model system, we show that mutational spectra can alter these distributions substantially, ultimately determining the competitive ability of each strain across environments. Computer simulation showed that the effect of mutational spectrum on hitchhiking dynamics follows a non-linear function, implying that even slight spectrum-dependent fitness differences are sufficient to alter mutator success frequency by several orders of magnitude. These results indicate an unanticipated central role for the mutational spectrum in the evolution of bacterial mutation rates. At a practical level, this study indicates that knowledge of the molecular details of resistance determinants is crucial for minimizing mutator evolution during antibiotic therapy.","2013",NA,"10.1371/journal.pgen.1003167","WOS:000314651500021"

The single deaminase domain APOBEC3H (A3H) enzyme is highly polymorphic and multiple A3H haplotypes have been identified. A3H haplotype II (A3H-hapII) possesses the strongest activity against HIV-1. There remains, however, uncertainty regarding the extent to which A3H-hapII is sensitive to HIV-1 Vif mediated degradation. We tested, therefore, the two different reference Vif proteins widely used in previous studies. We show that A3H-hapII is resistant to NL4-3 Vif while it is efficiently degraded by LAI Vif. Co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that LAI Vif, but not NL4-3 Vif associates with A3H-hapII. Chimeras between NL4-3 and LAI Vif identify the amino acid responsible for the differential degradation activity: A histidine at position 48 in Vif confers activity against A3H-hapII, while an asparagine abolishes its anti-A3H activity. Furthermore, the amino acid identity at position 48 only affects the degradation of A3H-hapII, whereas recognition of and activity against human A3D, A3F and A3G are only minimally affected. NL4-3 encoding 48H replicates better than NL4-3 WT (48N) in T cell-lines stably expressing A3H hapII, whereas there is no fitness difference in the absence of APOBEC3.

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has many distinct advantages for the study of mutation rate optimization given the wealth of structural and biochemical data on HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and mutants. In this study, we conducted parallel analyses of mutation rate and viral fitness. In particular, a panel of 10 RT mutants-most having drug resistance phenotypes-was analyzed for their effects on viral fidelity and fitness. Fidelity differences were measured using single-cycle vector assays, while fitness differences were identified using ex vivo head-to-head competition assays. As anticipated, virus mutants possessing either higher or lower fidelity had a corresponding loss in fitness. While the virus panel was not chosen randomly, it is interesting that it included more viruses possessing a mutator phenotype rather than viruses possessing an antimutator phenotype. These observations provide the first description of an interrelationship between HIV-1 fitness and mutation rate and support the conclusion that nnutator and antimutator phenotypes correlate with reduced viral fitness. In addition, the findings here help support a model in which fidelity comes at a cost of replication kinetics and may help explain why retroviruses like HIV-1 and RNA viruses maintain replication fidelity near the extinction threshold.

We previously described Env genetic diversification in a Zambian, subtype C infected, slow-progressor child (1157i) in parallel with an evolving neutralizing antibody response. Because of the role the Variable-3 loop (V3) plays in transmission, cell tropism, neutralization sensitivity, and fitness, longitudinally isolated 1157i C2-V4 alleles were cloned into HIV-1(NL4-3)-eGFP and -DsRed2 infectious molecular clones. The fluorescent reporters allowed for dual-infection competitions between all patient-derived C2-V4 chimeras to quantify the effect of V3 diversification and selection on fitness. 'Winners' and 'losers' were readily discriminated among the C2-V4 alleles. Exceptional sensitivity for detection of subtle fitness differences was revealed through analysis of two alleles differing in a single synonymous amino acid. However, when the outcomes of N = 33 competitions were averaged for each chimera, the aggregate analysis showed that despite increasing diversification and divergence with time, natural selection of C2-V4 sequences in this individual did not appear to be producing a 'survival of the fittest' evolutionary pattern. Rather, we detected a relatively flat fitness landscape consistent with mutational robustness. Fitness outcomes were then correlated with individual components of the entry process. Env incorporation into particles correlated best with fitness, suggesting a role for Env avidity, as opposed to receptor/coreceptor affinity, in defining fitness. Nevertheless, biochemical analyses did not identify any step in HIV-1 entry as a dominant determinant of fitness. Our results lead us to conclude that multiple aspects of entry contribute to maintaining adequate HIV-1 fitness, and there is no surrogate analysis for determining fitness. The capacity for subtle polymorphisms in Env to nevertheless significantly impact viral fitness suggests fitness is best defined by head-to-head competition.","2013",NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0063094","WOS:000321662800075"

This competition is especially strong in the rhizosphere. To evaluate competitive and mutualistic interactions between plants and microorganisms and to analyse ecological consequences of these interactions, we analysed 424 data pairs from 41 15N-labelling studies that investigated 15N redistribution between roots and microorganisms. Calculated MichaelisMenten kinetics based on Km (Michaelis constant) and Vmax (maximum uptake capacity) values from 77 studies on the uptake of nitrate, ammonia, and amino acids by roots and microorganisms clearly showed that, shortly after nitrogen (N) mobilization from soil organic matter and litter, microorganisms take up most N. Lower Km values of microorganisms suggest that they are especially efficient at low N concentrations, but can also acquire more N at higher N concentrations (Vmax) compared with roots. Because of the unidirectional flow of nutrients from soil to roots, plants are the winners for N acquisition in the long run. Therefore, despite strong competition between roots and microorganisms for N, a temporal niche differentiation reflecting their generation times leads to mutualistic relationships in the rhizosphere. This temporal niche differentiation is highly relevant ecologically because it: protects ecosystems from N losses by leaching during periods of slow or no root uptake; continuously provides roots with available N according to plant demand; and contributes to the evolutionary development of mutualistic interactions between roots and microorganisms.","2013",NA,"10.1111/nph.12235","WOS:000317682900007"

Pathogen community assembly may be driven by neutral stochastic colonization and extinction events or by niche differentiation that constrains pathogen distributions to particular environmental conditions, hosts, or vectors. Here, we present results from a regionally-replicated experiment investigating the community of barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses (B/CYDV's) in over 5000 experimentally planted individuals of six grass species along a 700 km latitudinal gradient along the Pacific coast of North America (USA) in response to experimentally manipulated nitrogen and phosphorus supplies. The composition of the virus community varied predictably among hosts and across nutrient-addition treatments, indicating niche differentiation among virus species. There were some concordant responses among the viral species. For example, the prevalence of most viral species increased consistently with perennial grass cover, leading to a 60% increase in the richness of the viral community within individual hosts (i.e., coinfection) in perennial-dominated plots. Furthermore, infection rates of the six host species in the field were highly correlated with vector preferences assessed in laboratory trials. Our results reveal the importance of niche differentiation in structuring virus assemblages. Virus species distributions reflected a combination of local host community composition, host species-specific vector preferences, and virus responses to host nutrition.

Fungicide treatment with phenylamides is often used to control the pathogen, but resistance occurs and continuous application may cause selection pressure which influences the pathogen's population structure. Field isolates collected from blue mold incidences in Germany and other countries of the European Mediterranean zone over a period of 10 years were screened for the presence of the two currently recognized phenotypes of the pathogen, one of which is fully tolerant to mefenoxam (metalaxyl-M). Besides the geographical distribution of the fungicide-tolerant strain in France, Italy and Germany, the long-term monitoring revealed a significant phenotype shift in the population of P. tabacina in Germany. This coincided with the alteration of disease management with respect to the fungicides recommended for use. While between 2002 and 2004 only metalaxyl-M-tolerant isolates were found in field accessions from Germany, the metalaxyl-M-sensitive strain occurred in 2005 and its ratio in the population increased gradually. Vice versa, the tolerant strain was not found anymore in samples 2010 and 2011. Infection experiments under controlled conditions with genetically homogenous strains of the two phenotypes revealed a significant higher virulence of the sensitive strain which is expressed in a two day reduction of the time period required from inoculation to sporulation. The consequence of fitness differences between the two phenotypes was tested in dual infection experiments starting with a 1:1 mixture of sporangia. When propagating the offspring by using the early produced sporangia for the next infection, the sensitive strain dominated already in the F-2 generation and no tolerant phenotype was detected with specific primers in PCR with DNA from sporangia after four infection cycles. In contrast, the tolerant strain could survive when late produced sporangia were used for the next round of infection. These results suggest that the dominance of the metalaxyl-M tolerant phenotype of P. tabacina in field samples is due to selection pressure caused by continuous intensive use of the fungicide rather than by natural selection criteria.

The ability to make an optimal decision depends on habitat quality, the quality and reliability of the cue for habitat choice, and the ability of the organism to respond to the cue appropriately. Questions: Do simple motile organisms select habitats that maximize fitness? Do they move such that densities in different habitats equalize fitness? Does the ability to select between habitats depend on the difference in habitat quality? Organism: Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a motile, chemo-and phototactic single-celled alga. Experiments: We introduced clonal populations, at 15 different densities, into either shaded or fully lighted aqueous habitats in one side of Petri dishes. The other side of the dishes contained either unused (high quality) or used (lower quality) growth media. We estimated fitness in control dishes containing a single habitat. We used the estimates to predict the density expected when algae could choose between light and shaded habitats in the same dish. Results: Fitness declined linearly with increasing density. Mean fitness was higher in control light than in control shade. Patterns of density and fitness in treatment dishes depended on which habitat the cells were introduced into, and on the quality of growth media. Cells were more abundant in light than in shade when introduced into the light side of habitat-selection dishes containing unused media. There was no difference in fitness between habitats in this treatment. Cells introduced into the shaded side with unused media attained similar densities in both habitats. Fitness was higher in light. Cell densities in the two habitats were also similar in both treatments containing used media. Fitness was higher in the light habitat in each of these treatments. Conclusion: Motile non-sentient species with simple sensory abilities can move among habitats to increase fitness. They can also attain distributions that equalize fitness differences between habitats. The threshold for adaptive habitat choice depends on the cues for habitat quality and the costs of habitat selection. Whether fitness and density differ between habitats depends on the quality of the environment in which habitat selection occurs.","2013",NA,NA,"WOS:000331380800006"

Segregation at smaller scales can be especially relevant for grazers living at the edge of their geographic distribution, because environmental factors can lead to similar distribution. Related grazer species may show dispersive, i.e. uniform, distribution at small scales (few centimetres) to reduce interference among individuals. We examined intra-and interspecific spatial distribution and habitat use in 2 phylogenetically related intertidal limpets, Scurria viridula and S. zebrina, at the polar and equatorial edge of their geographic distribution, respectively, and in S. araucana, a widely distributed species that overlaps the range of the other 2 species across the southeastern Pacific. S. viridula and S. zebrina overlapped in a narrow geographic zone (ca. 250 km) and reached relatively similar densities and sizes. Intraspecific spatial structure estimated through autocorrelation and individual-to-individual distances was random for S. viridula and variable for S. zebrina and S. araucana, depending on the scale considered; S. zebrina was aggregated at the individual-to-individual distances, while S. araucana was mostly random at this scale. Segregated distribution between S. viridula and S. zebrina was observed at the finer scale, whereas the association with S. araucana was random. Abundance of limpets loosely followed major habitats, namely bare rock and the alga Mazzaella laminarioides, which showed patchy distributions. We suggests that similarity in population traits between S. viridula and S. zebrina found in the overlap zone may be compensated by small-scale spatial segregation. Thus, at the edge of their geographic distribution, co existence between related species may be influenced by spatial niche differentiation driven by habitat suitability or competition.","2013",NA,"10.3354/meps10293","WOS:000319680700013"

One of the key mechanism underlying ecological insurance is that niche differentiation allows asynchronous responses to fluctuating environments, although the role of different ecological strategies (e.g., specialists vs generalists) has yet to be formally evaluated. We present here a simple experimental study that illustrates how different ecological strategies (i.e., generalists vs. specialists) can shape the biodiversity-insurance relationship. We assembled microcosm of generalists and specialist bacteria over a gradient of salinity and found that, bacterial communities made up of generalists were more productive and more stable over time under environmental fluctuations. We discuss our results in context with simple theoretical predictions and propose future directions for biological insurance theory. We argue that beyond species richness itself, it is essential to incorporate the distribution of ecological strategies across relevant environmental gradients as predictors of the insurance potential of biodiversity in natural ecosystems.","2013",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2012.00432","WOS:000330944500001"

Different soil compartments (surface, bulk, rhizospheric soil) and roots (young and old roots) were collected at three time points (the panicle initiation, heading and maturity periods) of the season. The population dynamics of bacterial (AOB) and archaeal (AOA) ammonia oxidizers was assayed by determining the abundance (using qPCR) and composition (using T-RFLP and cloning/sequencing) of their amoA genes (coding for a subunit of ammonia monooxygenase), that of nitrite oxidizers (NOB) by quantifying the nxrA gene (coding for a subunit of nitrite oxidase of Nitrobacter spp.) and the 16S rRNA gene of Nitrospira spp. The activity of the nitrifiers was determined by measuring the rates of potential ammonia oxidation and nitrite oxidation and by quantifying the copy numbers of amoA and nxrA transcripts. Potential nitrite oxidation activity was much higher than potential ammonia oxidation activity and was not directly affected by nitrogen amendment demonstrating the importance of ammonia oxidizers as pace makers for nitrite oxidizer populations. Marked differences in the distribution of bacterial and archaeal ammonia oxidizers, and of Nitrobacter-like and Nitrospira-like nitrite oxidizers were found in the different compartments of planted paddy soil indicating niche differentiation. In bulk soil, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (Nitrosospira and Nitrosomonas) were at low abundance and displayed no activity, but in surface soil their activity and abundance was high. Nitrite oxidation in surface soil was dominated by Nitrospira spp. By contrast, ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaeota and Nitrobacter spp. seemed to dominate nitrification in rhizospheric soil and on rice roots. In contrast to soil compartment, the level of N fertilization and the time point of sampling had only little effect on the abundance, composition and activity of the nitrifying communities. The results of our study show that in rice fields population dynamics and activity of nitrifiers is mainly differentiated by the soil compartments rather than by nitrogen amendment or season.","2013",NA,"10.1111/1462-2920.12098","WOS:000322625500012"

In this study we have investigated whether four species exhibit any in situ short-term changes in substrate uptake pattern when exposed to variations in substrate and growth conditions. Microautoradiography was combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization to investigate in situ cell-specific substrate uptake profiles of four probe-defined coexisting species in a wastewater treatment plant with enhanced biological phosphorus removal. These were the filamentous Candidatus Microthrix' and Caldilinea (type 0803), the polyphosphate-accumulating organism CandidatusAccumulibacter', and the denitrifying Azoarcus. The experimental conditions mimicked the conditions potentially encountered in the respective environment (starvation, high/low substrate concentration, induction with specific substrates, and single/multiple substrates). The results showed that each probe-defined species exhibited very distinct and constant substrate uptake profile in time and space, which hardly changed under any of the conditions tested. Such niche partitioning implies that a significant change in substrate composition will be reflected in a changed community structure rather than the substrate uptake response from the different species.","2013",NA,"10.1111/1462-2920.12074","WOS:000319873300013"

Principal Component Analysis was used to compare species composition of fungal community and faunal groups in burned and unburned plots. Independently of severity, fire generally caused a decrease in fungal mass, an increase in culturable total, xerotolerant and heat-stimulated fungi abundance (CFU), and minor changes in fungal species density. In parallel, fire induced a reduction in abundance and species density of studied faunal groups, generally correlated with fungal changes, and was consistently associated with the appearance of fungal and faunal. species not present in control. Moreover, qualitative and quantitative changes in fungal community and faunal groups were recorded in association with sampling time.

Results: Here we explore the nature and extent of viral metabolic reprogramming throughout the Pacific Ocean depth continuum. We describe 35 marine viral gene families with potential to reprogram metabolic flux through central metabolic pathways recovered from Pacific Ocean waters. Four of these families have been previously reported but 31 are novel. These known and new carbon pathway auxiliary metabolic genes were recovered from a total of 22 viral metagenomes in which viral auxiliary metabolic genes were differentiated from low-level cellular DNA inputs based on small subunit ribosomal RNA gene content, taxonomy, fragment recruitment and genomic context information. Auxiliary metabolic gene distribution patterns reveal that marine viruses target overlapping, but relatively distinct pathways in sunlit and dark ocean waters to redirect host carbon flux towards energy production and viral genome replication under low nutrient, niche-differentiated conditions throughout the depth continuum. Conclusions: Given half of ocean microbes are infected by viruses at any given time, these findings of broad viral metabolic reprogramming suggest the need for renewed consideration of viruses in global ocean carbon models.","2013",NA,"10.1186/gb-2013-14-11-r123","WOS:000330616200002"

In most methane oxidizing bacteria (methanotrophs), the copper-containing membrane bound methane monooxygenase (pMMO) catalyzes the first step in methane oxidation. We focused on the response of methanotrophic activity to a copper amendment in a rice paddy soil, measuring methane oxidation rates and following changes of pmoA diversity (a gene encoding for a subunit of the pMMO) both at DNA and mRNA level with a diagnostic microarray. Using transcripts (mRNA) as a proxy for taxon-specific activity, we found a clear separation between overall (DNA) and active (mRNA) community, the latter being dominated by type Ia methanotrophs. Copper addition transiently stimulated methane uptake. This stimulation correlated to a change within Methylosarcina-related transcripts shifting from Methylosarcina quisquiliarum to a yet uncultivated Methylosarcina sp. Overall, we demonstrate copper limitation in a soil, but to an extent that still allowed pmoA expression.

Using a comprehensive approach comprising of N-15(2) isotope labeling, acetylene reduction assay and nitrogenase gene expression analyses, we investigated nitrogen fixation in the sulfide-rich, chemoautotrophy-based Frasassi cave ecosystem (Italy). Nitrogen fixation was examined in three different microbial niches within the cave waters: (1) symbiotic bacterial community of Niphargus amphipods, (2) Beggiatoa-dominated biofilms, which occur at the sulfide-oxygen interface, and (3) sulfidic sediment. We found evidence for nitrogen fixation in all the three niches, and the nitrogenase gene (homologs of nifH) expression data clearly show niche differentiation of diazotrophic Proteobacteria within the water streams. The nifH transcript originated from the symbiotic community of Niphargus amphipods might belong to the Thiothrix ectosymbionts. Two abundantly expressed nifH genes in the Beggiatoa-dominated biofilms are closely related to those from Beggiatoa- and Desulfovibrio-related bacteria. These two diazotrophs were consistently found in Beggiatoa-dominated biofilms collected at various time points, thus illustrating species-specific associations of the diazotrophs in biofilm formation, and micron-scale niche partitioning of sulfur-oxidizing and sulfate-reducing bacteria driven by steep redox gradients within the biofilm. Finally, putative heterotrophs (Geobacter, Azoarcus and Desulfovibrio related) were the active diazotrophs in the sulfidic sediment. Our study is the first to shed light on nitrogen fixation in permanently dark caves and suggests that diazotrophy may be widespread in chemosynthetic communities.","2013",NA,"10.1038/ismej.2013.126","WOS:000327451800015"

Microbial ecologists in the meantime have faced many fundamental challenges, such as the lack of an ecologically coherent species definition, lack of adequate methods for evaluating population sizes and community composition in nature, and enormous taxonomic and functional diversity. The accessibility of powerful, culture-independent molecular microbiology methods offers an opportunity to close the gap between microbial science and the main stream of ecological theory, with the promise of new insights and tools needed to meet the grand challenges humans face as planetary engineers and galactic explorers. We focus specifically on resources related to energy metabolism because of their direct links to elemental cycling in the Earth's history, engineering applications and astrobiology. To what extent does the availability of energy resources structure microbial communities in nature? Our recent work on sulfur-and iron-oxidizing autotrophs suggests that apparently subtle variations in the concentration ratios of external electron donors and acceptors select for different microbial populations. We show that quantitative knowledge of microbial energy niches (population- specific patterns of energy resource use) can be used to predict variations in the abundance of specific taxa in microbial communities. Furthermore, we propose that resource ratio theory applied to micro-organisms will provide a useful framework for identifying how environmental communities are organized in space and time.","2013",NA,"10.1098/rstb.2012.0383","WOS:000320105200013"

Community composition of microbes, including HFL, is the result of past and current environmental selection, and different taxa may be indicative of food webs that cycle carbon and energy very differently. While all oceanic water columns can be density stratified due to the temperature and salinity characteristics of different water masses, the Arctic Ocean is particularly well stratified, with nutrients often limiting in surface waters and most photosynthetic biomass confined to a subsurface chlorophyll maximum layer, where light and nutrients are both available. This physically well-characterized system provided an opportunity to explore the community diversity of HFL from different water masses within the water column. We used high-throughput DNA sequencing techniques as a rapid means of surveying the diversity of HFL communities in the southern Beaufort Sea (Canada), targeting the surface, the subsurface chlorophyll maximum layer (SCM) and just below the SCM. In addition to identifying major clades and their distribution, we explored the micro-diversity within the globally significant but uncultivated clade of marine stramenopiles (MAST-1) to examine the possibility of niche differentiation within the stratified water column. Our results strongly suggested that HFL community composition was determined by water mass rather than geographical location across the Beaufort Sea.

In monocultures and on small spatial scales, the number of variable factors that may provide niches decreases. Still, even in the restricted volume of a soil core, typically more than one ectomycorrhizal species is found. We tested the hypothesis that roots of different individual beech genotypes provide niches on a small spatial scale in a pure beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) stand in the North-eastern Lowlands of Germany. Fourteen ectomycorrhizal species, as determined by ITS sequencing and phylograms were patchily distributed along an 81 m long transect with ten transect points. All root segments in the three species richest soil cores and the surrounding beeches were genotyped by microsatellite PCR. In each of the three soil cores, roots of two host genotypes were present that corresponded to the two closest mature trees. We found that the different root genotypes did not carry different sets of ectomycorrhizal species even at the high species resolution provided through our study. Therefore, the hypothesis of tree genotypes contributing to ectomycorrhizal biodiversity at the analyzed beech stand has to be rejected. Exploration types and stochastic processes are discussed as alternative explanations for the species richness and distributions in the analyzed soil cores. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that links ectomycorrhizal biodiversity in a soil core to the individual genotype of an angiosperm host.","2013",NA,"10.1007/s00468-013-0881-1","WOS:000324321600013"

Comparison of several different strains revealed high conservation of genes for autotrophic growth and showed that the ability to use gas mixtures for growth decreases or is lost upon prolonged culturing under heterotrophic conditions. The metabolic flexibility of C. difficile (heterotrophic growth on various substrates as well as autotrophy) could allow the organism in the gut to avoid competition by niche differentiation and contribute to its survival when stressed or in unfavorable conditions that cause death to other bacteria.

Molecular phylogenies based on the plastid gene rbcL and the nuclear 28S rDNA (D1-D3 region) revealed that both taxa consist of multiple lineages, each including a distinct Antarctic lineage.

The Antarctic P. borealis lineage is estimated to have diverged 7.8 (2-15) Ma ago, after the geographical and thermal isolation of the Antarctic continent. Despite not being psychrophilic, the Antarctic lineages of P. borealis and H. amphioxys have a lower optimal growth temperature and upper lethal temperature than most lineages from more temperate regions, indicating niche differentiation.

We have designed and applied new methods for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and digital image analysis of directionally dependent (anisotropic) multispecies biofilms. A sequential-FISH approach allowed multiple populations to be detected in a biofilm sample.

Seasonal differences in the relative activities of these groups might exist, since cultivated archaeal ammonia oxidizers have higher temperature optima than their bacterial counterparts. In this study, sediment collected from eutrophic freshwater Lake Taihu (China) was incubated at different temperatures (4 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 37 degrees C) for up to 8 weeks. We examined the active bacterial and archaeal ammonia oxidizers in these sediment microcosms by using combined stable isotope probing (SIP) and molecular community analysis. The results showed that accumulation of nitrate in microcosms correlated negatively with temperature, although ammonium depletion was the same, which might have been related to enhanced activity of other nitrogen transformation processes. Incubation at different temperatures significantly changed the microbial community composition, as revealed by 454 pyrosequencing targeting bacterial 16S rRNA genes. After 8 weeks of incubation, [C-13] bicarbonate labeling of bacterial amoA genes, which encode the ammonia monooxygenase subunit A, and an observed increase in copy numbers indicated the activity of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in all microcosms. Nitrosomonas sp. strain Is79A3 and Nitrosomonas communis lineages dominated the heavy fraction of CsCl gradients at low and high temperatures, respectively, indicating a niche differentiation of active bacterial ammonia oxidizers along the temperature gradient. The C-13 labeling of ammonia-oxidizing archaea in microcosms incubated at 4 to 25 degrees C was minor. In contrast, significant C-13 labeling of Nitrososphaera-like archaea and changes in the abundance and composition of archaeal amoA genes were observed at 37 degrees C, implicating autotrophic growth of ammonia-oxidizing archaea under warmer conditions.","2013",NA,"10.1128/AEM.00061-13","WOS:000317474800026"

Mn:Fe ratios of Mn and Fe oxide-rich biofilms, coatings, and mineral crusts that were abundant in several different caves ranged from ca. 0.1 to 1.0 as measured using ICP-OES. At sites where the Mn:Fe ratio approached 1.0 this represented an order of magnitude increase above the bulk bedrock ratio, suggesting that biomineralization processes play an important role in the formation of these cave ferromanganese deposits. Estimates of total bacterial SSU rRNA genes in ferromanganese biofilms, coatings, and crusts measured approximately 7x10(7)-9x10(9) cells/g wet weight sample. A SSU-rRNA based molecular survey of biofilm material revealed that 21% of the 34 recovered dominant (non-singleton) OTUs were closely related to known metal-oxidizing bacteria or clones isolated from oxidized metal deposits. Several different isolates that promote the oxidation of Mn(II) compounds were obtained in this study, some from high dilutions (10(-8)-10(-10)) of deposit material. In contrast to studies of caves in other regions, SSU rRNA sequences of Mn-oxidizing bacterial isolates in this study most closely matched those of Pseudomonas, Leptothrix, Flavobacterium, and Janthinobacterium. Combined data from geochemical analyses, molecular surveys, and culture-based experiments suggest that a unique consortia of Mn(II)-oxidizing bacteria are abundant and promoting biomineralization processes within the caves of the upper Tennessee River Basin.","2013",NA,"10.1080/01490451.2013.769651","WOS:000322307800002"

The primary goals of this work were to determine differences in community composition of high-temperature phototrophic mats distributed across the Yellowstone geothermal ecosystem, and to identify metabolic attributes of predominant organisms present in these communities that may correlate with environmental attributes important in niche differentiation. Random shotgun metagenome sequences from six phototrophic communities (average similar to 53 Mbp/site) were subjected to multiple taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional analyses. All methods, including G + C content distribution, MEGAN analyses, and oligonucleotide frequency-based clustering, provided strong support for the dominant community members present in each site. Cyanobacteria were only observed in non-sulfidic sites; de novo assemblies were obtained for Synechococcus-like populations at Chocolate Pots (CP_7) and Fischerella-like populations at White Creek (WC_6). Chloroflexi-like sequences (esp. Rosei-flexus and/or Chloroflexus spp.) were observed in all six samples and contained genes involved in bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis and the 3-hydroxypropionate carbon fixation pathway. Other major sequence assemblies were obtained for a Chlorobiales population from CP_7 (proposed family Thermochlorobacteriaceae), and an anoxygenic, sulfur-oxidizing Thermochromatium-like (Gamma-proteobacteria) population from Bath Lake Vista Annex (BLVA_20). Additional sequence coverage is necessary to establish more complete assemblies of other novel bacteria in these sites (e.g., Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes); however, current assemblies suggested that several of these organisms play important roles in heterotrophic and fermentative metabolisms.

Peanuts responded differently to irradiation, particularly with regards to tocopherol contents, primary and secondary oxidation products and oil stability index. Induction periods and tocopherol contents were negatively correlated with irradiation doses and decreased moderately during storage. alpha-Tocopherol was the most gamma radiation sensitive and peeled samples were the most affected. A positive correlation was found among tocopherol contents and the induction period of the oils extracted from irradiated samples. Gamma radiation and storage time increased oxidation compounds production.

Two types of dough were studied (to estimate dough shelf life): simple yeasted dough (SY) and double yeasted dough (DY). Fermentative activity (yeast viability, gassing power, and dough volume), rheological and textural parameters were assessed for frozen sweet doughs. These effects were explored by different and complementary methods: Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), dynamic rheology, texture profile analysis (TPA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The data showed that the longer the frozen storage time at -40 degrees C, the higher the decreased of frozen sweet dough quality. The rheological attributes such as hardness, Delta S, springiness, tan delta and yeast activity declined significantly during frozen storage. This modification led to lower specific volume of frozen sweet dough during proofing. The observed changes of the frozen sweet doughs rheological properties after thawing may be attributed to the damage on the gluten cross-linking, mainly produced by the ice crystallization during frozen storage.

During our sampling campaign in April and July 2007, this redox transition zone was associated with sharp peaks in a variety of parameters, including soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and total particulate phosphorus (TPP). Based on sequential extraction results, TPP maxima exhibited preferential accumulation of an operationally defined class of loosely adsorbed organic phosphorus (P), which may contain a substantial fraction of polyphosphate (poly-P). This poly-P may furthermore be involved in the redox-dependent remobilization of SRP. For example, direct fluorometric analysis of poly-P content revealed that particulate inorganic poly-P was present at concentrations ranging from 1 to 9 nM P within and several meters above the TPP maximum. Below the depth of 1% oxygen saturation, however, particulate inorganic poly-P was undetectable (<0.8 nM in situ). Assuming this concentration profile reflects the remineralization of inorganic poly-P to SRP across the redox transition, inorganic poly-P degradation accounted for as much as 4 +/- 3% (average +/- standard deviation) to 9 +/- 8% of the vertical turbulent diffusive SRP flux. This finding is a conservative estimate due in part to sample storage effects associated with our analysis of poly-P content. By comparison, iron-linked P cycling accounted for at most 65 +/- 33% of the diffusive SRP flux, leaving similar to 25% unaccounted for. Thus, while redox-sensitive poly-P remineralization in Effingham Inlet appears modest based on our direct conservative estimate, it may be higher from a mass balance viewpoint. Poly-P cycling may therefore be an overlooked mechanism for the redox-sensitive cycling of P in some hypoxic/anoxic boundaries, especially iron-poor marine oxygen minimum zones.","2012",NA,"10.1029/2011GB004226","WOS:000305637400001"

Mathematical models already play a leading role in these studies and are intended to predict future emergences. Here, using high-throughput sequencing, we analyzed the within-host population dynamics of four Potato virus Y (PVY) variants differing at most by two substitutions involved in pathogenicity properties. Model selection procedures were used to compare experimental results to six hypotheses regarding competitiveness and intensity of genetic drift experienced by viruses during host plant colonization. Results indicated that the frequencies of variants were well described using Lotka-Volterra models where the competition coefficients beta ij exerted by variant j on variant i are equal to their fitness ratio, rj/ri. Statistical inference allowed the estimation of the effect of each mutation on fitness, revealing slight (s = -0.45%) and high (s = -13.2%) fitness costs and a negative epistasis between them. Results also indicated that only 1 to 4 infectious units initiated the population of one apical leaf. The between-host variances of the variant frequencies were described using Dirichlet-multinomial distributions whose scale parameters, closely related to the fixation index F-ST, were shown to vary with time. The genetic differentiation of virus populations among plants increased from 0 to 10 days post-inoculation and then decreased until 35 days. Overall, this study showed that mathematical models can accurately describe both selection and genetic drift processes shaping the evolutionary dynamics of viruses within their hosts.","2012",NA,"10.1371/journal.ppat.1002654","WOS:000303444200044"

Leaves during Long-term Storage: Effects on Chemical Composition, Colour and Microbiological Quality","PHYTOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS","Introduction - Modern phytotherapy and quality assurance requires stability data on bioactive metabolites to identify and minimise decomposing factors during processing and storage. A compound's stability in a complex matrix can be different from the stability of the purified compound. Objective - To test the stability of iridoids and acteoside and quantify changes in colour and microbiological quality in a common herbal tea, dried P. lanceolata leaves during exposure to high-humidity air. To test the contribution of fungi to metabolite decomposition. Methodology - Dried P. lanceolata leaves were exposed to atmospheres of different relative humidity (75, 45 and 0%) for 24 weeks. Changes in aucubin and catalpol concentration were determined by CE-MEKC, and those in acteoside on TLC. Colour and chlorophyll-like pigments were measured by different spectrophotometric methods. The number of fungi was monitored; 10 strains were isolated from the plant drug, and their ability to decompose the analytes of interest was tested. Results - During incubation at 75% relative humidity (RH), aucubin, catalpol and acteoside concentrations decreased by 95.7, 97.0 and 70.5%, respectively. Strong shifts were detected in CIELAB parameters a* and b* (browning) as a result of conversion of chlorophyll to pheophytin. Intensive microbial proliferation was also observed. Changes at 45 or 0% RH were typically insignificant. Seven of the 10 isolated fungal strains could decompose both iridoids, and five could decompose acteoside in vitro. Conclusion - It was shown that exposure to water results in loss of bioactive molecules of P. lanceolata dried leaves, and that colonising fungi are the key contributors to this loss.

The majority of empirical studies conducted have only considered social traits in isolation, yet numerous social traits, such as the production of spiteful bacteriocins (anticompetitor toxins) and iron-scavenging siderophores (a public good) by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are frequently expressed simultaneously. Crucially, both bacteriocin production and siderophore cheating can be favored under the same competitive conditions, and we develop theory and carry out experiments to determine how the success of a bacteriocin-producing genotype is influenced by social cheating of susceptible competitors and the resultant impact on disease severity (virulence). Consistent with our theoretical predictions, we find that the spiteful genotype is favored at higher local frequencies when competing against public good cheats. Furthermore, the relationship between spite frequency and virulence is significantly altered when the spiteful genotype is competed against cheats compared with cooperators. These results confirm the ecological and evolutionary importance of considering multiple social traits simultaneously. Moreover, our results are consistent with recent theory regarding the invasion conditions for strong reciprocity (helping cooperators and harming noncooperators).","2012",NA,"10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01706.x","WOS:000310477600013"

During the development of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis, AM fungus at first senses the signals exuded by host plants, and then secretes corresponding Myc factors to dialogize with the plants. The host plant discriminates the Myc factors by superficial receptors located on the epidermal cells, and then initiates the symbiotic cascade, triggering the release of calcium from nuclear membrane, which leads to the calcium oscillations in perinuclear region. After decodes calcium oscillations, a nuclear-localized calcium and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) phosphorylates corresponding substrates and then activates transcription factors, inducing the expression of symbiosis-related genes. Different genes induced at different symbiotic stages work together to arrive at the final goal of forming AM. Such a symbiosis has evolved hundreds of millions of years, and has reached a high overall coordination. Cooperation between different species is intrinsically unstable. Rather, the mutualism is evolutionarily stable, because the partners cooperate to stabilize this joint through a fair resource partitioning mechanisms or beyond, which let AM coevolves from past to the future. Here, we give a comprehensive view about the molecular process of AM formation and the stabilizing mechanisms of this system.","2012",NA,"10.5897/AJMR11.1383","WOS:000303773300003"

The aim of this study was to identify factors predictive of HCC occurrence in a large cohort of HIV/HCV-co-infected patients with cirrhosis. Methods: This study involved 244 HIV/HCV-co-infected patients included in the ANRS CO13 HEPAVIH cohort, who had HCV-related cirrhosis (clinically or histologically proven cirrhosis, or liver stiffness >= 12.5 kPa) and no signs of HCC at baseline. Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify factors associated with HCC occurrence. Results: During a median follow-up of 2.6 (IQR, 1.8-3.5) years, 21 patients (8.6%) developed HCC. Diagnosis of HCC was based on histology in 5 patients (24%) and non-invasive criteria in 16 patients (76%). In univariate analyses, the following factors were related to HCC occurrence: age, previous cirrhosis decompensation, a HOMA value >3.8 (patients with treated diabetes were excluded from the HOMA calculation), a lower platelet count, a lower prothrombin level, and higher alpha-fetoprotein levels. The HOMA value was >3.8 at baseline in 66.7% of patients who developed HCC and in 35.3% of the remaining patients (p = 0.016). In multivariate analysis, age over 50 years (adjusted RR 3.2, 95% CI 1.2-9.0; p = 0.02) and a HOMA value >3.8 (adjusted RR 3.4, 95% CI 1.1-10.3; p = 0.03) remained significantly associated with HCC occurrence. Conclusions: As in HCV-mono-infected patients with HCV-related cirrhosis, insulin resistance appears to play a key role in HCC occurrence in HCV/HIV-co-infected patients with cirrhosis.

"Kwan, JJ; Borden, MA","Lipid monolayer collapse and microbubble stability","ADVANCES IN COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE","Microbubbles are micrometer-size gaseous particles suspended in water, and they are often stabilized by a lipid monolayer shell. Natural microbubbles are found in freshwater and saltwater systems, and engineered microbubbles have a variety of applications in food sciences, biotechnology and medicine. Lipid-coated microbubbles are found to have remarkable stability and mechanical behavior owing to the resistance of the lipid monolayer encapsulation to collapse. The purpose of this review is to tie in recent observations of lipid-coated microbubble dissolution and gas exchange with current literature on the physics of lipid monolayer collapse in the context of lung surfactant. Based on this analysis, we conclude that microbubble shells collapse through the nucleation of microscopic folds, which then catalyze the formation and aggregation of new folds, leading to macroscopic folding events. This process results in a cyclic behavior of crumple-to-smooth transitions, which can be modulated through lipid composition. Eventually, the microbubbles stabilize at 1-2 mu m diameter, regardless of initial size or lipid composition, and various mechanisms for this stabilization are postulated. Our ultimate goal is to inspire the reader to consider lipid monolayer collapse as the main long-term stabilizing mechanism for lipid-coated microbubbles, and to stimulate the use of microbubbles as a platform for studying monolayer collapse phenomena.

In this study, the AgI nanoparticles were immobilized on the surface of Ag8W4O16 nanorods by an anion-exchange route and their photocatalytic activities were evaluated by photocatalytic decomposition of methyl orange and phenol solutions under visible-light irradiation. A photoinduced self-stabilizing mechanism of the AgI nanoparticles was proposed to account for the formation of a stable Ag-AgI photocatalyst, namely, instable AgI can transform into a stable Ag-AgI photocatalyst after in situ formation of partial Ag on the surface of AgI nanoparticles. The photocatalytic performance of the immobilized AgI photocatalyst was greatly influenced by the formation of metallic Ag. With increasing repetitions of photocatalytic experiments, the initial deactivation was accompanied by the rapid increase of metallic Ag owing to the reduction of lattice Ag+, while the subsequently stable activity corresponds to the formation of a stable Ag-AgI composite photocatalyst.

In this study, phytoplankton were collected and identified from 8 sampling sites in Chaohu Lake every month from July to October, 2010. The niche breadth and niche overlap of common species were calculated using standard equations, and the potential relative growth rates of Microcystis were calculated as a weighted-value of niche overlap.

Redundancy analysis indicated that decreases in water temperature, dissolved oxygen and total dissolved phosphorus might be major factors underlying bloom decline. Based on the theory of community succession being caused by resource competition, the growth and decline of blooms can be predicted from a community structure.

Globally many freshwater ecosystems are degraded because of intensive human activities, so water ecosystem restoration is a burning issue worldwide. Selection of key regions for phytoplankton-related restoration is crucial for an effective aquatic eco-restoration. This paper presents a practical method for identification of key regions for phytoplankton-related restoration, using random forests (RFs) method to cluster sites based on dominance, biodiversity, water chemistry and ecological niche. We sampled phytoplankton for species richness and relative abundance and water quality in the Huai River basin (HRB), China to determine the phytoplankton communities' composition and structure and characterize of their ecological niches. A wider mean niche breadth of a species usually leads to a greater overlap with the niche of other species. Using these data and water quality indices, we identified the key regions for phytoplankton-related river restoration activities. Results indicate that our method for recognition of key regions is effective and practical and its application to the HRB identified the Northern Plain area as the key region for restoration. This area is severely polluted and contributes significantly to the HRB phytoplankton communities. Phytoplankton in this region is highly adaptable to environmental change and therefore will be relatively unharmed by environmental instability induced by restoration measures. During restoration, indices of water temperature, total phosphorus and chemical oxygen demand can be altered with little negative influence on phytoplankton communities, but measures that increase ammonia-nitrogen concentration would be highly detrimental. These results will provide valuable information for policy makers and stakeholders in water ecosystem restoration and sustainable basin management in the HRB.

We assembled monthly time-series of phytoplankton and zooplankton taxonomic richness, phytoplankton functional groups (species with similar functional traits) and physico-chemical environmental descriptors (temperature, conductivity, pH, P-PO43-, N-NO3-, light absorption). We used multiple linear regression to test: 1) the effect of environmental variability over time and depth on the accrual of plankton richness; and 2) the relative effect of richness and environmental variability on the stability of plankton. Environmental change was characterised by increase in temperature, decrease in phosphorus levels, reduced temporal variability of both, and higher heterogeneity of phosphorus over depth (spatial heterogeneity). These conditions occurred concurrently with accrual in plankton taxonomic and functional richness. Increase in temperature and spatial heterogeneity were the best predictors of phytoplankton richness, while phytoplankton richness and spatial heterogeneity had the strongest effects on zooplankton richness. Temporal stability in phytoplankton biovolume was mainly affected by variability in phosphorus and temperature, while zooplankton abundance levels were more strongly linked to fluctuations in nitrogen, temperature and phytoplankton biovolumes. Our analysis highlights that climate warming and re-oligotrophication may favour an increase in spatial (depth) heterogeneity in the water column of deep lakes, enhancing the potential for phytoplankton species co-existence and an increase in plankton richness. Our analysis also suggests that the intensity of fluctuations in key environmental variables can be a better predictor of plankton community stability then average richness.","2012",NA,"10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.20055.x","WOS:000306355700014"

The factors regulating this diversity are generally poorly understood, although access to limiting nutrients and light is known to influence distributions for certain groups of phytoplankton. Here, we develop a simple box model of biomasses and a limiting nutrient to describe the composition of phytoplankton communities in the euphotic zone. In addition to analyzing the relative importance of nutrient availability in generating and maintaining diversity, we apply the model to quantify the potential role of zooplankton grazing and ocean transport for the coexistence of competing species and phytoplankton diversity. We analyze the sensitivity of phytoplankton biomass distributions to different types of grazing functional responses and show that preferential grazing on abundant species, for example as formulated by the Holling type III grazing function, is a key factor for maintaining species' coexistence. Mixing and large-scale advection are shown to potentially have a significant impact on the distribution of phytoplankton species and, in general, enhance phytoplankton diversity. Based on the model solutions, we argue that ocean transports of phytoplankton cells can have a significant influence on species composition and that even transports at horizontal spatial scales of up to at least 10(2) km and vertical scales of 10(2) m can be expected to be important for sustaining phytoplankton diversity. The model is applied in a multi-species simulation (n = 200) and model simulations suggest that global patterns of phytoplankton biodiversity are determined by a few dominating species within each group. This finding is shown to be in accordance with ecological observations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","2012",NA,"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2011.11.005","WOS:000299984800002"

Nevertheless, the effects of mixotrophic consumers on lower trophic levels have not been investigated in the framework of recent biodiversity and ecosystem functioning research, although mixotrophic interactions can lead to enhanced variability of those relationships. The effects of ciliate consumer diversity and nutritional mode on algal prey biovolume and evenness as well as consumer biovolume were investigated in 2 freshwater microcosm experiments. Different species compositions in the consumer and algal assemblages of the 2 experiments resulted in partially different interactions. Increasing consumer richness decreased prey biovolume in both experiments. However, heterotrophic consumers decreased prey biovolume and evenness more than mixotrophs in one experiment, driven by a strong grazer that was not present in the other experiment. Consumer presence and richness affected prey evenness differently, preventing competitive dominance among algae in one experiment but leading to unbalanced grazing in an initially more even prey assemblage in the other experiment. Secondary production increased with consumer richness in both experiments but was differently affected by the consumers' nutritional mode due to altered competitive interactions and niche overlap in different species combinations. The present study demonstrated that consumer-specific characteristics, such as nutritional mode and feeding preferences, may alter consumer diversity effects on prey.","2012",NA,"10.3354/ame01573","WOS:000306321900005"

In this study, we quantify the trophic impact of marine mammals and seabirds in the Rio de la Plata estuary based on a previous trophic mass balance model of this estuary. The model comprised 37 functional groups: 3 species of marine mammals (2 cetaceans: Tursiops truncatus, Pontoporia blainvillei and 1 pinniped: Otaria flavescens), 1 coastal bird group comprising 11 species, 17 fish, 12 invertebrates, 2 zooplanktons, 1 phytoplankton, detritus, and 5 fishing fleets. Model results showed that seabirds, O. flavescens and P. blainvillei, are apex predators, with high levels of niche overlap among them, suggesting competition for similar resources such as fish species. Marine mammals and seabirds produce negative effects on commercially important species, while, at the same time, indirect positive effects (increase of the biomass) were also detected in some groups related to trophic cascade effects.","2012",NA,"10.1007/s12237-012-9545-4","WOS:000309660700015"
"Brauer, VS; Stomp, M; Huisman, J","The Nutrient-Load Hypothesis: Patterns of Resource Limitation and Community Structure Driven by Competition for Nutrients and Light","AMERICAN NATURALIST","Resource competition theory predicts that the outcome of competition for two nutrients depends on the ratio at which these nutrients are supplied. Yet there is considerable debate whether nutrient ratios or absolute nutrient loads determine the species composition of phytoplankton and plant communities. Here we extend the classical resource competition model for two nutrients by including light as additional resource. Our results suggest the nutrient-load hypothesis, which predicts that nutrient ratios determine the species composition in oligotrophic environments, whereas nutrient loads are decisive in eutrophic environments. The underlying mechanism is that nutrient enrichment shifts the species interactions from competition for nutrients to competition for light, which favors the dominance of superior light competitors overshadowing all other species. Intermediate nutrient loads can generate high biodiversity through a fine-grained patchwork of two-species and three-species coexistence equilibria. Depending on the species traits, however, competition for nutrients and light may also produce multiple alternative stable states, suppressing the predictability of the species composition. The nutrient-load hypothesis offers a solution for several discrepancies between classical resource competition theory and field observations, explains why eutrophication often leads to diversity loss, and provides a simple conceptual framework for patterns of biodiversity and community structure observed in nature.","2012",NA,"10.1086/665650","WOS:000304354600007"

A Test Using Pitcher-Plant Inquiline Species","PLOS ONE","Trade-offs among species' ecological interactions is a pervasive explanation for species coexistence. The traits associated with trade-offs are typically measured to mechanistically explain species coexistence at a single spatial scale. However, species potentially interact at multiple scales and this may be reflected in the traits among coexisting species. I quantified species' ecological traits associated with the trade-offs expected at both local (competitive ability and predator tolerance) and regional (competitive ability and colonization rate) community scales. The most common species (four protozoa and a rotifer) from the middle trophic level of a pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea) inquiline community were used to link species traits to previously observed patterns of species diversity and abundance. Traits associated with trade-offs (competitive ability, predator tolerance, and colonization rate) and other ecological traits (size, growth rate, and carrying capacity) were measured for each of the focal species. Traits were correlated with one another with a negative relationship indicative of a trade-off. Protozoan and rotifer species exhibited a negative relationship between competitive ability and predator tolerance, indicative of coexistence at the local community scale. There was no relationship between competitive ability and colonization rate. Size, growth rate, and carrying capacity were correlated with each other and the trade-off traits: Size was related to both competitive ability and predator tolerance, but growth rate and carrying capacity were correlated with predator tolerance. When partial correlations were conducted controlling for size, growth rate and carrying capacity, the trade-offs largely disappeared. These results imply that body size is the trait that provides the basis for ecological interactions and trade-offs. Altogether, this study showed that the examination of species' traits in the context of coexistence at different scales can contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying community structure.","2012",NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0041809","WOS:000306687700153"
"Matthews, B; Pomati, F","Reversal in the relationship between species richness and turnover in a phytoplankton community","ECOLOGY","Negative relationships between species richness and the rate of compositional turnover are common, suggesting that diverse communities have greater stability than depauperate ones; however, the mechanistic basis for this pattern is still widely debated. Species richness and turnover can covary either because they are mechanistically linked or because they share common environmental drivers. Few empirical studies have combined long-term changes in community composition with multiple drivers of environmental change, and so little is known about how the underlying mechanisms of species coexistence interact with changes in the mean and variability of environmental conditions. Here, we use a 33 year long time series (1976-2008) of phytoplankton community composition from Lake Zurich, to examine how environmental variation influences the relationship between richness and annual turnover. We find that the relationship between richness and annual turnover reverses midway through the time series (1992-1993), leading to a hump-shaped relationship between species richness and annual turnover. Using structural equation modeling we show that annual turnover and diversity are independently associated with different drivers of environmental change. Furthermore, we find that the observed annual sequences of community assembly give rise to rates of species accumulation that are more heterogeneous through time than expected by chance, likely owing to a high proportion of species showing significant autocorrelation and to strong positive covariation in the occurrences of species.","2012",NA,"10.1890/11-2289.1","WOS:000310834900014"

Knowledge of how trophic interaction strengths are affected by differences among habitats is crucial for understanding variation in ecological systems. Here we show how substantial variation in consumption-rate data, and hence trophic interaction strengths, arises because consumers tend to encounter resources more frequently in three dimensions (3D) (for example, arboreal and pelagic zones) than two dimensions (2D) (for example, terrestrial and benthic zones). By combining new theory with extensive data (376 species, with body masses ranging from 5.24 x 10(-14) kg to 800 kg), we find that consumption rates scale sublinearly with consumer body mass (exponent of approximately 0.85) for 2D interactions, but superlinearly (exponent of approximately 1.06) for 3D interactions. These results contradict the currently widespread assumption of a single exponent (of approximately 0.75) in consumer-resource and food-web research. Further analysis of 2,929 consumer-resource interactions shows that dimensionality of consumer search space is probably a major driver of species coexistence, and the stability and abundance of populations.","2012",NA,"10.1038/nature11131","WOS:000305760600033"

We conducted a factorial experiment to investigate the effects of weeds coexisting with maize (Zea mays L.) on Pb accumulation in maize and soil microbes at two Pb levels (ambient and 300 mg/kg). Elevated Pb tended to increase the Pb concentration in maize and decreased soil microbial activity (indicated by the average well color development, AWCD), functional group diversity, as well as arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization and vesicle number of maize. Compared to the monoculture, weeds coexisting with maize reduced the Pb concentrations in the root, leaf, sheath and stem of maize at both seedling and mature stages. In maize-weed mixtures, soil microbial activity and functional group diversity tended to increase for both Pb treatments relative to the monoculture. Furthermore, principal component analysis revealed that the soil microbial community structure changed with the introduction of weeds. The highest Pb accumulation in weeds occurred for the elevated Pb treatment in a three species mixture. The results suggest that multiple plant species coexistence could reduce lead accumulation in crop plants and alleviate the negative impacts on soil microbes in polluted land, thereby highlighting the significance of plant diversity in agroecosystems.","2012",NA,"10.1016/S1001-0742(11)60721-3","WOS:000301869300006"

Their feeding ability is determined by the morphological features of the polyps. Capture of their food by these corals is also affected by the flexibility of the colony, which in turn is determined by the features of the sclerites. We studied the morphological features of two azooxanthellate octocorals, Dendronephthya hemprichi and D. sinaiensis, whose depth distribution partially overlaps at Eilat (northern Red Sea). Following Gause's Law, such coexistence is considered to be possible if each species is adapted to utilize different food items. In order to examine this Law, the features of the polyps of the two species and their sclerites were studied. Each side of their tentacles displays 11-13 pinnules, which are longer at the tentacles' distal end compared to its median section and proximal end, with the distal pinnules of D. sinaiensis being longer than those of D. hemprichi. At the proximal end of the tentacles of D. sinaiensis, the pinnules emerge perpendicularly, unlike in D. hemprichi, where they emerge from the lateral sides; the distance between the rows of pinnules is, therefore, shorter for the former. These findings imply that the filtered phytoplankton by the two species may differ in size. Their sclerites also differ in size and shape, and therefore the expansion and contraction abilities of their polyps also differ, and may thus affect their respective feeding abilities. The findings indicate that D. hemprichi and D. sinaiensis are adapted to utilize different food items, and therefore support Gause's Law and explain the coexistence of the two species.","2012",NA,"10.1007/s12526-011-0093-0","WOS:000303872600007"

This is potentially significant because fungal pathogens are thought to play a key role in promoting and structuring plant diversity in tropical forests through the Janzen-Connell mechanism. Therefore, we hypothesize that the drying of tropical forests will negatively impact species coexistence. To test one prediction of this hypothesis, we imposed experimental watering regimes on the seedlings of a tropical tree, Pleradenophora longicuspis, and measured mortality induced by fungal pathogens under shade house conditions. The frequency of watering had a strong impact on survival. Seedlings watered daily experienced significantly higher mortality than those watered every three or every six days, while increasing the volume of water applied also led to increased mortality, although this relationship was less pronounced. These results suggest that the capacity of fungal pathogens to drive density-dependent mortality may be reduced in drier climates and when rainfall is less frequent, with potential implications for the diversity enhancing Janzen-Connell mechanism.","2012",NA,"10.1002/ece3.252","WOS:000312448400007"

Different ecological niches are inferred from estimates of body mass, diet, and locomotor behavior. Body masses were estimated using a regression analysis based on living marsupials. Possible dietary preferences were explored by an analysis of the development of molar shearing crests. Inferences about locomotor behaviors of some species with well-preserved postcranial skeletal remains were derived from a published morphofunctional analysis. From the wide range of estimated body masses and diet several niches were inferred: small- to medium-sized insectivores, small- to medium-sized insectivore-frugivores, and medium- to large-sized frugivores. According to our results, Paucituberculata and Microbiotheria of the Santa Cruz Formation constitute an ecologically diverse assemblage that inhabited forested habitats, developed under warm temperatures and seasonal rainfall.

However, the impact of vertically transmitted symbionts, that can markedly modify their hosts biology, is largely unknown. Some females of the Drosophila parasitoid Leptopilina boulardi are infected with an inherited virus (LbFV). The virus forces females to lay supernumerary eggs in already parasitised hosts, thus allowing its horizontal transmission. Using two independent experimental procedures, we found that LbFV impacts inter-specific competition between L. boulardi and the related L. heterotoma. While L. boulardi rapidly outcompetes L. heterotoma in the absence of the virus, L. heterotoma was able to maintain or even to eliminate L. boulardi in the presence of LbFV. By forcing females to superparasitise, LbFV induced egg wastage in L. boulardi thus explaining its impact on the competition outcome. We conclude that this symbiont whose transmission is L. boulardi-density-dependant may affect the coexistence of Leptopilina species.","2012",NA,"10.1111/j.1461-0248.2012.01774.x","WOS:000303666200012"
"Beltrán, E; Valiente-Banuet, A; Verdú, M","Trait divergence and indirect interactions allow facilitation of congeneric species","ANNALS OF BOTANY","Background Plant facilitation occurs when the presence of a plant (i.e. a nurse plant) modifies the environment, making it more favourable for the establishment and survival of other species (i.e. facilitated plants), which can germinate and grow nearby. Facilitative associations can be maintained or turned into competition as the facilitated seedling grows. According to the competition-relatedness hypothesis that suggests that closely related species tend to compete more, facilitation turns into competition between phylogenetically close species. However, some examples of facilitation between congeneric species, which are supposed to be closely related species, have been found in nature. Scope In this work, some examples of congeneric facilitation and subsequent coexistence are reviewed and an attempt is made to explain those exceptions to the competition-relatedness hypothesis. Conclusions Two mechanisms are proposed that can switch the facilitation-competition balance: trait divergence and indirect interactions. When traits have diverged within the genus, the niche overlap is reduced and competition relaxed, thus allowing the coexistence of congeneric species. The presence of third interplayers (mycorrhizal fungi, seed dispersers, pollinators or pathogens) participating in the interaction between plants can alleviate the competition or enhance the reproduction and allow the coexistence of species that could not coexist in their absence.","2012",NA,"10.1093/aob/mcs089","WOS:000310892900003"

However, parasites - usually regarded in terms of their detrimental effects on the individuals they infect - can also have positive impacts on other species in the community. We now recognize that parasites influence species coexistence and extirpation by altering competition, predation, and herbivory, and that these effects can, in turn, influence ecosystem properties. Parasites and pathogens act as ecosystem engineers, alter energy budgets and nutrient cycling, and influence biodiversity. Equally, because ecosystem properties - such as biodiversity - affect parasite populations, there is the potential for feedback between parasitism and ecosystem states. Using examples from animal and plant systems, we examine this potential bidirectional interdependence and challenge the conventional wisdom that parasites have only negative or inconsequential impacts on ecological communities.","2012",NA,"10.1890/110016","WOS:000303425200016"

Landscape change, such as habitat destruction, is thought to greatly influence coexistence under competition-colonization dynamics, although there is no formal test of this prediction. Here we present the first illustration of competition-colonization dynamics that fully transposes theory into a controlled experimental metacommunity of two Pseudomonas bacterial strains. The competition-colonization dynamics were achieved by directly manipulating trade-off strength and colonization rates to generate the full range of coexistence conditions and responses to habitat destruction. Our study successfully generates competition-colonization dynamics matching theoretical predictions, and our results further reveal a negative relationship between diversity and productivity when scaling up to entire metacommunities.","2012",NA,"10.1038/ncomms2239","WOS:000316356700002"

Species-area relationships (SARs), measuring how the number of observed species increases upon enlarging the sampled area, constitute a convenient tool for quantifying the spatial structure of biodiversity. While general features of species-area curves are quite universal across ecosystems, some quantitative aspects can change significantly. Several attempts have been made to link these variations to ecological forces. Within the framework of spatially explicit neutral models, here we scrutinize the effect of varying the local population size (i.e. the number of individuals per site) and the level of habitat saturation (allowing for empty sites). We conclude that species-area curves become shallower when the local population size increases, while habitat saturation, unless strongly violated, plays a marginal role.

These functions facilitate the coexistence of less mobile invertebrates (in comparison with mysids, such as amphipods) that are associated with seagrass leaves, and may also enhance the coexistence of highly mobile invertebrates such as mysid. We investigated the function of seagrass in supporting the coexistence of two mysid species, Neomysis awatschensis and N. mirabilis. These taxa are dominant in seagrass ecosystems of temperate coastal areas. We compared patterns of habitat use between the two species at mesoscales (among seagrass patches) and microscales (among seagrass leaves) by performing field surveys and laboratory experiments. The field survey results showed positive correlations in the abundance of the two mysid species, indicating that both species select similar habitats at the mesoscale level. In the laboratory experiments, the pattern of microhabitat selection (fundamental habitat) was similar for both species, even at increased densities and with the presence of an immobile habitatcompetitor (the gastropod Barleeia angustata) on the leaves. However, this pattern changed significantly when a food source (epiphytic microalgae) was present on the leaves. This result indicates that (i) inter-and intraspecific interference competition does not affect microhabitat selection in these two mysids and (ii) both Neomysis species use similar habitats at the feeding stage. Although these two closely related mysids species may have similar requirements for microhabitat and food, the evidence that they did not act as competitors is attributable to unrestricted microhabitat and food (e. g., epiphytic algae) in the presence of seagrass vegetation.","2012",NA,"10.1007/s10750-011-0909-8","WOS:000298809300010"

The interaction between mutualism, facilitation or interference and exploitation competition is of major interest as it may govern species coexistence. However, the interplay of these mechanisms has received little attention. This issue dates back to Gause, who experimentally explored competition using protists as a model [Gause, G.F. (1935) Verifications experimentales de la theorie mathematique de la lutte pour la vie. Actualites Scientifiques et Industrielles, 277]. He showed the coexistence of Paramecium caudatum with a potentially allelopathic species, Paramecium bursaria. 2. Paramecium bursaria hosts the green algae Chlorella vulgaris. Therefore, P. bursaria may benefit from carbohydrates synthesised by the algae. Studying endosymbiosis with P. bursaria is possible as it can be freed of its endosymbiont. In addition, C. vulgaris is known to produce allelochemicals, and P. bursaria may benefit also from allelopathic compounds. 3. We designed an experiment to separate the effects of resource exploitation, endosymbiosis and allelopathy and to assess their relative importance for the coexistence of P. bursaria with a competitor that exploits the same resource, bacteria. The experiment was repeated with two competitors, Colpidium striatum or Tetrahymena pyriformis. 4. Results show that the presence of the endosymbiont enables the coexistence of competitors, while its loss leads to competitive exclusion. These results are in agreement with predictions based on resource equilibrium density of monocultures (R*) supporting the idea that P. bursaria's endosymbiont is a resource provider for its host. When P. bursaria and T. pyriformis coexist, the density of the latter shows large variation that match the effects of culture medium of P. bursaria. Our experiment suggests these effects are because of biochemicals produced in P. bursaria culture. 5. Our results expose the hidden diversity of mechanisms that underlie competitive interactions. They thus support Gauses's speculation (1935) that allelopathic effects might have been involved in his competition experiments. We discuss how a species engaged both in competition for a resource and in costly interference such as allelopathy may counterbalance these costs with a resource-provider endosymbiont.","2012",NA,"10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01894.x","WOS:000297849300023"

However, whether plant uptake of IN and ON responds to differences in soil microbial community composition and/or functioning has not yet been explored, despite soil microbes playing a key role in N cycling. Here, we report results from a competition experiment testing the hypothesis that soil microbial communities differing in metabolic activity as a result of long-term differences to grazing exposure could modify N uptake of Eriophorum vaginatum L. and Nardus stricta L. These graminoids co-occur on nutrient-poor, mountain grasslands where E. vaginatum decreases and N. stricta increases in response to long-term grazing. We inoculated sterilised soil with soil microbial communities from continuously grazed and ungrazed grasslands and planted soils with both E. vaginatum and N. stricta, and then tracked uptake of isotopically labelled NH4+ (IN) and glycine (ON) into plant tissues. The metabolically different microbial communities had no effect on N uptake by either of the graminoids, which might suggest functional equivalence of soil microbes in their impacts on plant N uptake. Consistent with its dominance in soils with greater concentrations of ON relative to IN in the soluble N pool, Eriophorum vaginatum took up more glycine than N. stricta. Nardus stricta reduced the glycine proportion taken up by E. vaginatum, thus increasing niche overlap in N usage between these species. Local abundances of these species in mountain grasslands are principally controlled by grazing and soil moisture, although our results suggest that changes in the relative availability of ON to IN can also play a role. Our results also suggest that coexistence of these species in mountain grasslands is likely based on non-equilibrium mechanisms such as disturbance and/or soil heterogeneity.","2012",NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0051193","WOS:000312064100079"

We modeled the community-level outcomes of competition, using experimentally derived competitive effects and responses between an exotic invasive plant, Centaurea stoebe, and species from both its native and nonnative ranges and using changes in these effects and responses elicited by experimentally establishing symbioses between C. stoebe and fungal endophytes.

Concomitantly, C. stoebe was eliminated from the models with European natives but was codominant in models with North American natives. Endophyte symbiosis predicted increased dominance of C. stoebe in North American communities but not in European communities. However, when experimental variation was included, some of the model outcomes changed slightly.

The species richness of roots and rhizomes has never been compared with aboveground richness in natural plant communities. We made direct comparisons of grassland plant richness in identical volumes (0.1 x 0.1 x 0.1 m) above and below the soil surface, using conventional species identification to measure aboveground richness and 454 sequencing of the chloroplast trnL(UAA) intron to measure belowground richness. We described above- and belowground richness at multiple spatial scales (from a neighbourhood scale of centimetres to a community scale of hundreds of metres), and related variation in richness to soil fertility. Tests using reference material indicated that 454 sequencing captured patterns of species composition and abundance with acceptable accuracy. At neighbourhood scales, belowground richness was up to two times greater than aboveground richness. The relationship between above- and belowground richness was significantly different from linear: beyond a certain level of belowground richness, aboveground richness did not increase further. Belowground richness also exceeded that of aboveground at the community scale, indicating that some species are temporarily dormant and absent aboveground. Similar to other grassland studies, aboveground richness declined with increasing soil fertility; in contrast, the number of species found only belowground increased significantly with fertility. These results indicate that conventional aboveground studies of plant richness may overlook many coexisting species, and that belowground richness becomes relatively more important in conditions where aboveground richness decreases. Measuring plant belowground richness can considerably alter perceptions of biodiversity and its responses to natural and anthropogenic factors.","2012",NA,"10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05390.x","WOS:000302616200018"
"Limberger, R; Wickham, SA","Disturbance and diversity at two spatial scales","OECOLOGIA","The spatial scale of disturbance is a factor potentially influencing the relationship between disturbance and diversity. There has been discussion on whether disturbances that affect local communities and create a mosaic of patches in different successional stages have the same effect on diversity as regional disturbances that affect the whole landscape. In a microcosm experiment with metacommunities of aquatic protists, we compared the effect of local and regional disturbances on the disturbance-diversity relationship. Local disturbances destroyed entire local communities of the metacommunity and required reimmigration from neighboring communities, while regional disturbances affected the whole metacommunity but left part of each local community intact. Both disturbance types led to a negative relationship between disturbance intensity and Shannon diversity. With strong local disturbance, this decrease in diversity was due to species loss, while strong regional disturbance had no effect on species richness but reduced the evenness of the community. Growth rate appeared to be the most important trait for survival after strong local disturbance and dominance after strong regional disturbance. The pattern of the disturbance-diversity relationship was similar for both local and regional diversity. Although local disturbances at least temporally increased beta diversity by creating a mosaic of differently disturbed patches, this high dissimilarity did not result in regional diversity being increased relative to local diversity. The disturbance-diversity relationship was negative for both scales of diversity. The flat competitive hierarchy and absence of a trade-off between competition and colonization ability are a likely explanation for this pattern.","2012",NA,"10.1007/s00442-011-2140-8","WOS:000301706800018"

Closely related species often differ greatly in the quality and breadth of resources exploited, but the actual mechanisms causing these differences are poorly understood. Because in the laboratory specialized species often survive and perform as well or better on host species that are never utilized in nature, negative ecological interactions restricting host range must exist. Here, we focused on reproductive interference, which has been theoretically predicted to drive niche separation between closely related species with overlapping mating signals. 2. We examined the interspecific sexual interactions in relation to ecological specialization and generalization in two sibling ladybird species, Harmonia yedoensis and Harmonia axyridis. Harmonia yedoensis is a specialist predator that preys only on pine aphids, which are highly elusive prey for ladybird hatchlings, whereas H.similar to axyridis is a generalist predator with a broad prey and habitat range. 3. We experimentally showed that conspecific sperm fertilized the vast majority of eggs regardless of mating order (i.e. conspecific sperm precedence) when a female of H.similar to yedoensis or H.similar to axyridis mated with both a conspecific and a heterospecific male. Moreover, we demonstrated that mating opportunities of H.similar to yedoensis females strongly decreased as heterospecific density increased relative to conspecific density. In contrast, in H.similar to axyridis, female mating success was high regardless of conspecific or heterospecific density. 4. Our results suggest that the generalist H.similar to axyridis should be dominant to the specialist H.similar to yedoensis in terms of reproductive interference. Our results support the hypothesis that asymmetric reproductive interference from the dominant species may force the non-dominant species to become a specialist predator that exclusively utilizes less preferred prey in nature.","2012",NA,"10.1111/j.1365-2656.2012.01984.x","WOS:000307343100017"
"Fukasawa, Y","Effects of wood decomposer fungi on tree seedling establishment on coarse woody debris","FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT","Although decomposer fungi have been recognized to play important roles in forest carbon and nutrient cycling as well as soil humus formation, their effects on forest dynamics, such as tree regeneration, are far less well understood than the effects of symbiotic and pathogenic fungi. In this study, I focused on tree regeneration on fallen woody debris, nurse logs. I examined the effects of wood decomposer fungi on species composition and population densities of tree seedlings (height <50 cm) established on these logs. In an abandoned tract of coppice forest in Honshu. Japan, a thick litter layer had accumulated on the forest floor and seedlings of the small-seeded pioneer tree species Clethra barbinervis (Ericales) were found to be preferentially established on rotting fallen logs of the Japanese red pine Pinus densiflora. C. barbinervis seedling establishment was considerably reduced on soil probably because there were impediments to colonization on the ground, such as the thick litter layer, which was less well developed on logs. In contrast, larger-seeded species such as Aphananthe aspera, Carpinus spp., Quercus serrata, and Rhus trichocarpa preferentially established on soil. Characteristics of wood decomposition by fungi varied among logs, and this variability significantly influenced C barbinervis seedling density. Seedling density was significantly higher on brown-rotted logs than that on logs belonging to other decay types. Wood pH was lower in brown-rotted logs than that in logs belonging to other decay types and was negatively correlated with seedling density. Thus, pine coarse woody debris and the functional diversity of wood inhabiting fungi influence the establishment of diverse tree seedlings in this abandoned Japanese coppice forest.

The JanzenConnell hypothesis provides explanations for species coexistence and predicts that recruitment of tree juveniles is reduced by host-specific enemies, particularly soil biota. Previous studies, however, have not fully addressed the aspect of host specificity. Using a legume tree (Ormosia glaberrima) in a subtropical monsoon forest as a model, we experimentally investigated the mechanisms underlying a JanzenConnell effect. 2. A negative plantsoil feedback was identified by a field census and confirmed by planting surface-sterilized seeds at different densities around focal trees. Fungicides were applied to test whether the effects were caused by fungi. In a growth-room inoculation experiment, effects of collected soil samples on seedling survival were examined and compared to soil samples treated with fungicides. Sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) sequence of the 28S ribosomal RNA gene was used for pathogen identification. The fungus causing seedling mortality was isolated and characterized by ITS rDNA sequencing and inoculation experiments. 3. A JanzenConnell effect was identified at a field site, in which O. glaberrima was a locally common species. In situ treatments with fungicides and a corresponding growth-room simulation experiment showed that seedling survival depended on the distance to focal adult trees and that a fungal pathogen attacked seeds and seedlings. No negative plantsoil feedback was observed at another field site with a single O. glaberrima tree, indicating a locally rare species advantage. 4. The disease-inducing fungus was identified as Fusarium oxysporum. Inoculation experiments showed that the isolated fungus was pathogenic on O. glaberrima seedlings, but non-pathogenic on seedlings from other tree species co-occurring with O. glaberrima. Moreover, susceptibility of O. glaberrima depended on seed provenance (likely genotype). 5. Synthesis. We demonstrate that an observed negative plantsoil feedback on a locally common legume tree is caused by a host-specific pathogen. Our data fully support the criteria of spatially unequal pathogen distribution and host specificity proposed in the JanzenConnell model. Taken the interaction between O. glaberrima and F. oxysporum as a paradigm, we suggest that host-specific pathogens, locally accumulated around parent trees, are important determinants of tree community structure.","2012",NA,"10.1111/j.1365-2745.2012.01953.x","WOS:000305335400019"

Here we use automated spectrophotometry to develop an in vitro method for indirectly distinguishing fitness (growth) differences among virus strains, based on direct measures of their infected bacterial hosts. We used computer simulations of a mathematical model for phage growth to predict which features of bacterial growth curves were best associated with differences in growth among phage strains. We then tested these predictions using the in vitro method to confirm which of the inferred viral growth traits best reflected known fitness differences among genotypes of the RNA phage phi-6, when infecting a Pseudomonas syringae host. Results showed that the inferred phage trait of time-to-extinction (time required to drive bacterial density below detectable optical density) reliably correlated with genotype rankings based on absolute fitness (phage titer per ml).

Selfing may promote reproductive isolation by facilitating local adaptation, causing reduced hybrid fitness in parental environments. Here, we propose a novel mechanism by which selfing can further impair interspecific gene flow: selfing may act to ensure that nonhybrid progeny systematically co-occur whenever hybrid genotypes are produced. Under a competition arena, the fitness differentials between nonhybrid and hybrid progeny are then magnified, preventing development of interspecific hybrids. We investigate whether this sibling competition arena can explain the coexistence in sympatry of closely related species of the plant fungal pathogens (Microbotryum) causing anther-smut disease. The probabilities of intrapromycelial mating (automixis), outcrossing, and sibling competition were manipulated in artificial inoculations to evaluate their contribution to reproductive isolation. We report that both intrapromycelial selfing and sibling competition significantly reduced rates of hybrid infection beyond that expected based solely upon selfing rates and noncompetitive fitness differentials between hybrid and nonhybrid progeny. Our results thus suggest that selfing and a sibling competition arena can combine to constitute a barrier to gene flow and diminish selection for additional barriers to gene flow in sympatry.","2012",NA,"10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01563.x","WOS:000304757200019"

However, the prevalence of AP, which genes are subject to AP, and to what extent and how AP may be resolved remain unclear. By measuring the fitness difference between the wild-type and null alleles of similar to 5,000 nonessential genes in yeast, we found that in any given environment, yeast expresses hundreds of genes that harm rather than benefit the organism, demonstrating widespread AP. Nonetheless, under sufficient selection, AP is often resolvable through regulatory evolution, primarily by trans-acting changes, although in one case we also detected a cis-acting change and localized its causal mutation. However, AP is resolved more slowly in smaller populations, predicting more unresolved AP in multicellular organisms than in yeast.

Clinical observations show that the relationship between adherence and likelihood of resistance differs dramatically among drug classes. We developed a mathematical model that explains these observations and predicts treatment outcomes. Our model incorporates drug properties, fitness differences between susceptible and resistant strains, mutations and adherence. We show that antiviral activity falls quickly for drugs with sharp dose-response curves and short half-lives, such as boosted protease inhibitors, limiting the time during which resistance can be selected for. We find that poor adherence to such drugs causes treatment failure via growth of susceptible virus, explaining puzzling clinical observations. Furthermore, our model predicts that certain single-pill combination therapies can prevent resistance regardless of patient adherence.

A fundamental question for understanding DENV evolution is the relative extent to which stochastic processes (genetic drift) and natural selection acting on fitness differences among lineages contribute to lineage diversity and turnover. Here, we used a set of recently collected and archived low-passage DENV-1 isolates from Thailand to examine the role of mosquito vector-virus interactions in DENV evolution. By comparing the ability of 23 viruses isolated on different dates between 1985 and 2009 to be transmitted by a present-day Aedes aegypti population from Thailand, we found that a major clade replacement event in the mid-1990s was associated with virus isolates exhibiting increased titers in the vector's hemocoel, which is predicted to result in a higher probability of transmission. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that selection for enhanced transmission by mosquitoes is a possible mechanism underlying major DENV clade replacement events. There was significant variation in transmission potential among isolates within each clade, indicating that in addition to vector-driven selection, other evolutionary forces act to maintain viral genetic diversity. We conclude that occasional adaptive processes involving the mosquito vector can drive major DENV lineage replacement events.","2012",NA,"10.1128/JVI.06458-11","WOS:000299308000051"

The model accounts for multiple infections of target cells, CD4-downregulation, and the delay between the infection of a cell and the production of new virus particles. The minimum threshold level of infection induced by a virus inoculum is determined via a series of dilution experiments, and is used to determine the probability of infection of a susceptible cell as a function of local virus density.

(S)-HPMPC and its 2,6-diaminopurine counterpart, (S)-HPMPDAP, have been described to select, in vitro, for drug resistance mutations in the viral DNA polymerase (E9L) gene of vaccinia virus (VACV). Here, to extend our knowledge of drug resistance development among orthopoxviruses, we selected, in vitro, camelpox viruses (CMLV) resistant to (S)-HPMPDAP and identified a single amino acid change, T831I, and a double mutation, A314V+A684V, within E9L. The production of recombinant CMLV and VACV carrying these amino acid substitutions (T831I, A314V, or A314V+A684V) demonstrated clearly their involvement in conferring reduced sensitivity to viral DNA polymerase inhibitors, including (S)-HPMPDAP. Both CMLV and VACV harboring the A314V change showed comparable drug-susceptibility profiles to various antivirals and similar impairments in viral growth. In contrast, the single change T831I and the double change A314V+A684V in VACV were responsible for increased levels of drug resistance and for cross-resistance to viral DNA polymerase antivirals that were not observed with their CMLV counterparts. Each amino acid change accounted for an attenuated phenotype of VACV in vivo. Modeling of E9L suggested that the T -> I change at position 831 might abolish hydrogen bonds between E9L and the DNA backbone and have a direct impact on the incorporation of the acyclic nucleoside phosphonates.

Difficulties in establishing representative Symbiodinium cultures from Pacific coral isolates limit the availability of diverse Symbiodinium types, especially in the C clade. While this clade exhibits high subcladal diversity (over 100 types), and represents the ecologically dominating phylotype in Indo-Pacific corals, only two ancestral types Cl and C3 are currently in permanent culture. This study attempted to cultivate Symbiodinium C15, a derived C clade type, from the Hawaiian coral Porites compressa. We tested a number of basic media in combination with defined organic supplements, as well as host factor derived additives and ion-manipulated media, in order to mimic the intracellular ion regime of a zooxanthellate host. While basic media did not support cell survival at all, the use of organic supplements such as amino acids plus taurine or host derived tissue homogenate had a positive effect on survival and stabilized in vitro densities temporarily. However, none of the conditions tested supported a proliferating motile Symbiodinium C15 culture. In two independent experiments, a potentially free-living Symbiodinium A clade strain was successfully cultured, which exhibited phylogenetic separation from endosymbiotic A clade strains. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of host mimics or host derived supplements to study otherwise 'unculturable' Symbiodinium strains. Our results imply that Symbiodinium C15 is incapable of surviving ex hospite unless a host-derived or potential host mimicking feature is present. This potential host dependency has important implications for post-bleaching recovery of the endemic coral P. compressa and suggests a coevolutionary link between vertical transmission mode, host dependency of the symbiont and bleaching resistance of this holobiont.

To determine the impact of immune escape mutations selected by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) on viral fitness in the context of the cognate transmitted/founder (T/F) genome, we developed a new competitive fitness assay using molecular clones of T/F genomes lacking exogenous genetic markers and a highly sensitive and precise parallel allele-specific sequencing (PASS) method. Results: The T/F and mutant viruses were competed in CD4(+) T-cell enriched cultures, relative proportions of viruses were assayed after repeated cell-free passage, and fitness costs were estimated by mathematical modeling. Naturally occurring HLA B57-restricted mutations involving the TW10 epitope in Gag and two epitopes in Tat/Rev and Env were assessed independently and together. Compensatory mutations which restored viral replication fitness were also assessed. A principal TW10 escape mutation, T242N, led to a 42% reduction in replication fitness but V247I and G248A mutations in the same epitope restored fitness to wild-type levels. No fitness difference was observed between the T/F and a naturally selected variant carrying the early CTL escape mutation (R355K) in Env and a reversion mutation in the Tat/Rev overlapping region. Conclusions: These findings reveal a broad spectrum of fitness costs to CTL escape mutations in T/F viral genomes, similar to recent findings reported for neutralizing antibody escape mutations, and highlight the extraordinary plasticity and adaptive potential of the HIV-1 genome.

To investigate the decay of VCV resistance mutations, a standard clonal analysis of full-length env (gp160) was performed on plasma HIV-1 samples obtained at week 28 (the time of VCV discontinuation) and at three subsequent time points (weeks 30, 42, and 48). During 132 days, VCV-resistant HIV-1 was replaced by VCV-sensitive viruses whose V3 loop sequences differed from the dominant pretreatment forms. A deep-sequencing analysis showed that the week 48 VCV-sensitive V3 loop form emerged from a preexisting viral variant. Enfuvirtide was added to the antiretroviral regimen at week 30; by week 48, enfuvirtide treatment selected for either the G36D or N43D HR-1 mutation. Growth competition experiments demonstrated that viruses incorporating the dominant week 28 VCV-resistant env were less fit than week 0 viruses in the absence of VCV but more fit than week 48 viruses. This week 48 fitness deficit persisted when G36D was corrected by either site-directed mutagenesis or week 48 gp41 domain swapping. The correction of N43D, in contrast, restored fitness relative to that of week 28, but not week 0, viruses. Virus entry kinetics correlated with observed fitness differences; the slower entry of enfuvirtide-resistant viruses corrected to wild-type rates in the presence of enfuvirtide. These findings suggest that while VCV and enfuvirtide select for resistance mutations in only one env subunit, gp120 and gp41 coevolve to maximize viral fitness under sequential drug selection pressures.","2012",NA,"10.1128/JVI.00286-12","WOS:000304894100004"

One way to explore and further understand these complexities is via a factorial manipulation of community composition and environmental conditions. Using laboratory based aquatic microcosms we manipulated environmental fluctuation by creating two environments; one with variable light and one with constant light. Within these environments, community composition was manipulated by constructing communities from all possible combinations of three species that vary in their reliance on light for growth (an autotroph: a diatom completely reliant on light, a heterotroph: a Paramecium species not reliant on light, and a mixotroph: a Paramecium species somewhat reliant on light). Community composition was predicted to affect populations and communities by introducing and altering competitive interactions between species and affecting the degree of niche differentiation between species. We found that population stability was predominantly influenced by an interaction between community composition and environmental variability, whereby the effect of environmental variability synergistically combined with effects of community composition to reduce population stability. Covariance of populations was determined by an interaction between community composition and environmental variability, though this did not result from the effect of niche differentiation between species. Species interactions drove correlations between population biomass and the environment which otherwise did not exist. Our results demonstrate the complex and interrelated effects of abiotic and biotic factors on population and community stability, and suggest the need to consider aspects of community composition when predicting the impact of environmental fluctuations.","2012",NA,"10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.19523.x","WOS:000300877100002"

Nitrogen (N) was the primary nutrient limiting phytoplankton primary productivity and biomass. Phytoplankton biomass was also enhanced by phosphorus (P) added either alone or jointly with N, suggesting different components of the phytoplankton experienced distinct nutrient limitations. Based on quantitative PCR, the diazotrophic cyanobacteria Anabaena sp. and C. raciborskii were responsible for the primary production response to P additions, while the nondiazotrophic Microcystis aeruginosa appeared to benefit from N released from the diazotrophs. Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii maintained high net growth rates under diazotrophic and nondiazotrophic conditions, while Anabaena sp. growth was significantly reduced under DIN enrichment. C. raciborskii appears to be a generalist with regard to N source, a lifestyle traditionally not considered a viable ecological strategy among diazotrophs. Using facultative diazotrophy, C. raciborskii gains a growth advantage under fluctuating DIN conditions, such as systems that are under the influence of anthropogenic N loading events. The described niche differentiation may be a key factor explaining the recent global expansion of C. raciborskii.","2012",NA,"10.1111/j.1574-6941.2011.01264.x","WOS:000299257300021"

However, the presence of unknown, but critical networks hampers understanding of complex and dynamic food webs in nature. Here, we empirically demonstrate a missing link, both critical and variable, by revealing that direct predator-prey relationships between shorebirds and biofilm are widespread and mediated by multiple ecological and evolutionary determinants. Food source mixing models and energy budget estimates indicate that the strength of the missing linkage is dependent on predator traits (body mass and foraging action rate) and the environment that determines food density. Morphological analyses, showing that smaller bodied species possess more developed feeding apparatus to consume biofilm, suggest that the linkage is also phylogenetically dependent and affords a compelling re-interpretation of niche differentiation. We contend that exploring missing links is a necessity for revealing true network structure and dynamics.","2012",NA,"10.1111/j.1461-0248.2012.01744.x","WOS:000301349600007"

Recent evidence from deep subseafloor sediments suggesting acetogenesis in the presence of sulfate reduction and methanogenesis has called this notion into question, however. Here I argue that acetogens can successfully coexist with sulfate reducers and methanogens for multiple reasons. These include (1) substantial energy yields from most acetogenesis reactions across the wide range of conditions encountered in the subseafloor, (2) wide substrate spectra that enable niche differentiation by use of different substrates and/or pooling of energy from a broad range of energy substrates, (3) reduced energetic cost of biosynthesis among acetogens due to use of the reductive acetyl CoA pathway for both energy production and biosynthesis coupled with the ability to use many organic precursors to produce the key intermediate acetyl CoA. This leads to the general conclusion that, beside Gibbs free energy yields, variables such as metabolic strategy and energetic cost of biosynthesis need to be taken into account to understand microbial survival in the energy-depleted deep biosphere.","2012",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2011.00284","WOS:000208863600053"

Abundance and transcription of bacterial DMSP degradation genes, DMSP lyase enzyme activity, and DMS and DMSP concentrations, consumption rates and production rates were quantified over time and depth. This interdisciplinary data set was used to test current hypotheses of the role of light and carbon supply in regulating upper-ocean sulfur cycling. Findings supported UV-A-dependent phytoplankton DMS production. Bacterial DMSP degraders may also contribute significantly to DMS production when temperatures are elevated and UV-A dose is moderate, but may favour DMSP demethylation under low UV-A doses. Three groups of bacterial DMSP degraders with distinct intraannual variability were identified and niche differentiation was indicated. The combination of genetic and biochemical data suggest a modified bacterial switch hypothesis where the prevalence of different bacterial DMSP degradation pathways is regulated by a complex set of factors including carbon supply, temperature and UV-A dose.","2012",NA,"10.1111/j.1462-2920.2012.02700.x","WOS:000302934000009"

The distribution along an estuarine gradient of the highly specialised genus Methanosaeta was investigated and compared to the previously determined distribution of the more metabolically flexible Desulfobulbus. Methanosaeta genotypic distribution along the Colne estuary (Essex, UK) was determined by DNA- and RNA-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses. Methanosaeta distribution was monotonic, with a consistently diverse community and no apparent niche partitioning either in DNA or RNA analyses. This distribution pattern contrasts markedly with the previously described niche partitioning and sympatric differentiation of the model generalist, Desulfobulbus. To explain this difference, it is hypothesised that Methanosaeta's strict metabolic needs limit its adaptation potential, thus populations do not partition into spatially distinct groups and so do not appear to be constrained by gross environmental factors such as salinity. Thus, at least for these two model genera, it appears that metabolic flexibility may be an important factor in spatial distribution and this may be applicable to other microbes.","2012",NA,"10.1007/s00248-011-9993-6","WOS:000306127300015"

Light spectra, steady-state (after 1 h) microprofiles of O2, gross photosynthesis (Pg), community respiration in light (RL) and net community photosynthesis (Pn) were measured in diatom- and cyanobacteria-dominated communities below increasing layers of Ulva. Photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) decreased exponentially with increasing layers of algae and the light spectrum was increasingly enriched in the green and deprived in blue and red regions. Sediment Pg, Pn and RL decreased as the number of Ulva layers increased; however, 1.6 times higher macroalgal density was necessary to fully inhibit cyanobacteria Pg compared with diatoms, indicating that cyanobacteria were better adapted to this light environment. Long-term (3 weeks) incubations of diatom-dominated sediments below increasing layers of Ulva resulted in a shift in the taxonomic composition of the MPB towards cyanobacteria. Hence, changes in the light climate below macroalgal accumulations can negatively affect the photosynthetic activity of sediments. However, spectral niche differentiation of MPB taxonomic groups and concurrent changes in the MPB community may provide sediments with increased resilience to the detrimental effects of eutrophication.","2012",NA,"10.1111/j.1758-2229.2012.00335.x","WOS:000303856500004"

Vertically transmitted Neotyphodium endophytes of grasses often hybridize in nature. Infection by these hybrid symbionts may result in different hostplant phenotypes from those caused as a result of infection by nonhybrid symbionts. Observations of wild Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica) populations show that hybrid Neotyphodium-infected (H+) grasses dominate in resource-poor environments, whereas nonhybrid endophyte-infected (NH+) grasses dominate in environments with more resources. We studied the hypothesis that hybridization of endophytes increases stress tolerance of the host. To test whether hybridization of Neotyphodium affects performance and competitive abilities of the host depending on resources, we conducted a glasshouse experiment where competition, nutrients and watering were manipulated. H+ plants had greater wet biomass than NH+ and endophyte-free plants, when grown in competition, but only in low-water and low-nutrient treatments. By contrast, NH+ plants did not perform better than H+ or endophyte-free plants regardless of the treatment combination. Our results suggest that hybridization of symbiotic Neotyphodium endophytes may increase competitive potential of the host in stressful environments and that this hybridization may be underlying niche expansion of Arizona fescue in the environments with low resources.","2012",NA,"10.1111/j.1469-8137.2012.04140.x","WOS:000304448500025"

The mats were associated with high upward fluxes of sulfide produced by anaerobic oxidation of methane, and grew at temperatures close to the freezing point of seawater. They ranged from small patches of 0.2-5 m in diameter (gray mats) to extensive fields covering up to 850 m(2) of seafloor (white mats) and were formed by diverse sulfide-oxidizing bacteria differing in color and size. Overall, both the dominant mat-forming thiotrophs as well as the associated bacterial communities inhabiting the mats differed in composition for each mat type as determined by microscopy, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis. While the smaller gray mats were associated with a highly diverse composition of sulfide oxidizers, the larger white mats were composed of only 1-2 types of gliding Beggiatoa filaments. Molecular analyses showed that most of the dominant mat-forming sulfide oxidizers were phylogenetically different from, but still closely related to, thiotrophs known from warmer ocean realms. The psychrophilic nature of the polar mat-forming thiotrophs was tested by visual observation of active mats at in situ temperature compared to their warming to > 4 A degrees C. The temperature range of mat habitats and the variation of sulfide and oxygen fluxes appear to be the main factors supporting the diversity of mat-forming thiotrophs in cold seeps at continental margins.","2012",NA,"10.5194/bg-9-2947-2012","WOS:000308290200010"

In this study, the anammox bacterial communities were detected by molecular analysis targeting the 16S rRNA genes in the sediments of Lake Taihu, a large and shallow eutrophic freshwater lake in China. The recovery of specific 16S rRNA sequences with two stable monophyletic clusters indicated that anammox bacteria were present in Lake Taihu. A phylogenetic analysis indicated that these two groups represent two novel lineages within the first subgroup of anammox bacteria, independent of the treeing methods. High intra-lake variability in anammox bacterial diversity and community composition was observed, in particular, based on a 1% cut-off of 16S rRNA sequence variation. The spatial variability was largely related to the substrate availability, which was denoted by the correlations between the relative abundance of the two Taihu anammox bacterial groups and the concentrations of ammonium and nitrite. This indicates that the niche differentiation of anammox bacteria is linked to the environmental heterogeneity. These findings suggest that the freshwater lakes may accommodate different anammox bacterial communities and, thus, expand our knowledge on the diversity and distribution of anammox bacteria.

We examined the discrete and combined effects of mineral nitrogen deposition and geothermal heating on ammonia-oxidizing communities by sampling soils from a long-term fertilization site along a temperature gradient in Icelandic grasslands. Microarray, clone library and quantitative PCR analyses of the ammonia monooxygenase subunit A (an-loA) gene accompanied by physico-chemical measurements of the soil properties were conducted. In contrast to most other terrestrial environments, the ammonia-oxidizing communities consisted almost exclusively of archaea. Their bacterial counterparts proved to be undetectable by quantitative polymerase chain reaction suggesting AOB are only of minor relevance for ammonia oxidation in these soils. Our results show that fertilization and local, geothermal warming affected detectable ammonia-oxidizing communities, but not soil chemistry: only a subset of the detected AOA phylotypes was present in higher temperature soils and AOA abundance was increased in the fertilized soils, while soil physio-chemical properties remained unchanged. Differences in distribution and structure of AOA communities were best explained by soil pH and clay content irrespective of temperature or fertilizer treatment in these grassland soils, suggesting that these factors have a greater potential for ecological niche-differentiation of AOA in soil than temperature and N fertilization.","2012",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2012.00352","WOS:000208863600355"

To compare the photoinhibition of bacterial and archaeal ammonia oxidizers, specific growth rates of two ammonia-oxidizing archaea (Nitrosopumilus maritimus and Nitrosotalea devanaterra) and bacteria (Nitrosomonas europaea and Nitrosospira multiformis) were determined at different light intensities under continuous illumination and light/dark cycles. All strains were inhibited by continuous illumination at the highest intensity (500 similar to mu E similar to m-2 similar to s-1). At lower light intensities, archaeal growth was much more photosensitive than bacterial growth, with greater inhibition at 60 similar to mu E similar to m-2 similar to s-1 than at 15 similar to mu E similar to m-2 similar to s-1, where bacteria were unaffected. Archaeal ammonia oxidizers were also more sensitive to cycles of 8-h light/16-h darkness at two light intensities (60 and 15 similar to mu E similar to m-2 similar to s-1) and, unlike bacterial strains, showed no evidence of recovery during dark phases.

Orchids produce minute seeds with few nutrient reserves, thus requiring mycorrhizal fungi for germination. Therefore, both environmental conditions and mycorrhizal fungi distribution affect their germination success, but these ecological requirements and their congruence with habitat preferences of adults remain poorly understood. We investigated the importance of these factors during germination in four forest orchid species of the genus Epipactis. Methods: We sowed seeds of three habitat specialists and one generalist in different forest types at sites harboring adults of at least one of these ecologically diverging species. We analyzed germination pattern and identified mycorrhizal fungi of both seedlings and adults. Key results: Habitat conditions had little influence on germination pattern as seedlings grew in more habitats than expected from the adults' ecology. Ectomycorrhizal fungi availability did not limit germination. Suitable mycorrhizal fungi, mostly pezizalean ascomycetes, were recruited in various forest types, though the fungal communities differed according to habitat type. Finally, orchids with divergent ecological preferences shared similar mycorrhizal fungi. Conclusions: Limited adult distribution contrasted with successful seed germination at diverse sites and indicates existence of niche differentiation between adults and seedlings.

This phyloecological study integrates data on fungiid distribution patterns along environmental gradients on the Spermonde Shelf, SW Sulawesi, with a recently published phylogeny reconstruction of the Fungiidae. A mushroom coral fauna of 34 species was used to compare their distributions by use of 50-m(2) belt quadrats in transects (1) from the mainland to the shelf edge, (2) around reefs with regard to predominant wind directions, and (3) over bathymetrical reef zones. Species association ordinations were made for each of the four shelf zones using both abundance and incidence data to examine whether closely related species co-occurred. Some closely related species or even sister species appeared to show very similar distribution patterns and to coexist in high abundances. These results indicate that there may not be community saturation and competitive exclusion among mushroom corals species, most of which are free-living. In reconstructions of fungiid habitat evolution, offshore reef slopes appear to be original (ancestral), whereas onshore habitats, shallow reef flats, and deep sandy reef bases seem to be derived.

The availability of hundreds of shotgun metagenomic datasets from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) enables us to explore the distribution and diversity of known CRISPRs in human-associated microbial communities and to discover new CRISPRs. We propose a targeted assembly strategy to reconstruct CRISPR arrays, which whole-metagenome assemblies fail to identify. For each known CRISPR type (identified from reference genomes), we use its direct repeat consensus sequence to recruit reads from each HMP dataset and then assemble the recruited reads into CRISPR loci; the unique spacer sequences can then be extracted for analysis. We also identified novel CRISPRs or new CRISPR variants in contigs from whole-metagenome assemblies and used targeted assembly to more comprehensively identify these CRISPRs across samples. We observed that the distributions of CRISPRs (including 64 known and 86 novel ones) are largely body-site specific. We provide detailed analysis of several CRISPR loci, including novel CRISPRs. For example, known streptococcal CRISPRs were identified in most oral microbiomes, totaling similar to 8,000 unique spacers: samples resampled from the same individual and oral site shared the most spacers; different oral sites from the same individual shared significantly fewer, while different individuals had almost no common spacers, indicating the impact of subtle niche differences on the evolution of CRISPR defenses.

Lactobacillus reuteri strain 100-23 and Lactobacillus johnsonii strain 100-33 cohabit in the forestomach of mice. According to the niche exclusion principle, this should not be possible because both strains can utilise the two main fermentable carbohydrates present in the stomach digesta: glucose and maltose. We show, based on gene transcription analysis, in vitro physiological assays, and in vivo experiments that the two strains can co-exist in the forestomach habitat because 100-23 grows more rapidly using maltose, whereas 100-33 preferentially utilises glucose. Mutation of the maltose phosphorylase gene (malA) of strain 100-23 prevented its growth on maltose-containing culture medium, and resulted in the numerical dominance of 100-33 in the forestomach. The fundamental niche of L. reuteri 100-23 in the mouse forestomach can be defined in terms of 'glucose and maltose trophism'. However, its realised niche when L. johnsonii 100-33 is present is 'maltose trophism'. Hence, nutritional adaptations provide niche differentiation that assists cohabitation by the two strains through resource partitioning in the mouse forestomach.

We explored the differences in fundamental niches and potential distributions of an ecological guild of slime moulds-protosteloid amoebae-in the Iberian Peninsula. A large set of samples collected in a north-east to south-west transect of approximately 1000 km along the peninsula was used to test the hypothesis that, together with the existence of suitable microhabitats, climate conditions may determine the probability of survival of species. Although protosteloid amoebae share similar morphologies and life history strategies, canonical correspondence analyses showed that they have varied ecological optima, and that climate conditions have an important effect in niche differentiation. Maxent environmental niche models provided consistent predictions of the probability of presence of the species based on climate data, and they were used to generate maps of potential distribution in an 'everything is everywhere' scenario. The most important climatic factors were, in both analyses, variables that measure changes in conditions throughout the year, confirming that the alternation of fruiting bodies, cysts and amoeboid stages in the life cycles of protosteloid amoebae constitutes an advantage for surviving in a changing environment.

Failure to adequately address the deteriorating infrastructure networks threatens our environment, public health, and safety. Analysis of whole-metagenome pyrosequencing data and 16S rRNA gene clone libraries was used to determine microbial composition and functional genes associated with biomass harvested from crown (top) and invert (bottom) sections of a corroded wastewater pipe. Results: Taxonomic and functional analysis demonstrated that approximately 90% of the total diversity was associated with the phyla Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. The top (TP) and bottom pipe (BP) communities were different in composition, with some of the differences attributed to the abundance of sulfide-oxidizing and sulfate-reducing bacteria. Additionally, human fecal bacteria were more abundant in the BP communities. Among the functional categories, proteins involved in sulfur and nitrogen metabolism showed the most significant differences between biofilms. There was also an enrichment of genes associated with heavy metal resistance, virulence (protein secretion systems) and stress response in the TP biofilm, while a higher number of genes related to motility and chemotaxis were identified in the BP biofilm. Both biofilms contain a high number of genes associated with resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds subsystems. Conclusions: The function potential of wastewater biofilms was highly diverse with level of COG diversity similar to that described for soil. On the basis of the metagenomic data, some factors that may contribute to niche differentiation were pH, aerobic conditions and availability of substrate, such as nitrogen and sulfur. The results from this study will help us better understand the genetic network and functional capability of microbial members of wastewater concrete biofilms.","2012",NA,"10.1186/1471-2180-12-122","WOS:000307236000001"

Adopting this approach we investigated whether the trophic niche of centipedes, as major invertebrate predators in forest soil food webs, changes with maturation, season or forest age. Generally, each of the four centipede species studied differed significantly in their FA composition suggesting trophic niche differentiation. FA profiles differed more strongly in the two geophilomorph (Strigamia acuminata and Geophilus ribauti) than in the two lithobiomorph species (Lithobius crassipes and Lithobius mutabilis) suggesting that in particular the former feed on markedly different prey. FA profiles changed during post-embryonic development in each of the four centipede species. Differences were most pronounced in the two lithobiomorph species shifting to predominantly fungal feeding prey. Further, FA profiles varied with season indicating that centipedes exploit more prey out of the bacterial channel in autumn. FA profiles of centipedes varied little with forest age suggesting that soil food webs are remarkably invariant across different forest ecosystems. The results indicate that FA composition of second order consumers closely reflects changes in diet of prey species and composition of basal resources. The study proved FA profiles as powerful tool to gain insight into critical characteristics of soil food web stability, i.e., compartmentalisation and the relative importance and variability of energy channels.

Yet, ferrihydrite is unstable and rapidly transforms to more crystalline Fe(III) oxides (e.g., goethite, hematite), which are poorly reduced by model dissimilatory Fe(III)-reducing microorganisms. This begs the question, what processes and microbial groups are responsible for reduction of crystalline Fe(III) oxides within sedimentary environments? Further, how do changes in Fe mineralogy shape oxide hosted microbial populations? To address these questions, we conducted a largescale cultivation effort using various Fe(III) oxides (ferrihydrite, goethite, hematite) and carbon substrates (glucose, lactate, acetate) along a dilution gradient to enrich for microbial populations capable of reducing Fe oxides spanning a wide range of crystallinities and reduction potentials. While carbon source was the most important variable shaping community composition within Fe(III)-reducing enrichments, both Fe oxide type and sediment dilution also had a substantial influence. For instance, with acetate as the carbon source, only ferrihydrite enrichments displayed a significant amount of Fe(III) reduction and the wellknown dissimilatory metal reducer Geobacter sp. was the dominant organism enriched. In contrast, when glucose and lactate were provided, all three Fe oxides were reduced and reduction coincided with the presence of fermentative (e.g., Enterobacter spp.) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (e.g., Desulfovibrio spp.). Thus, changes in Fe oxide structure and resource availability may shift Fe(III)-reducing communities between dominantly metalrespiring to fermenting and/or sulfate-reducing organisms which are capable of reducing more recalcitrant Fe phases. These findings highlight the need for further targeted investigations into the composition and activity of speciation-directed metal-reducing populations within natural environments.","2012",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2012.00404","WOS:000208863600405"

While three major types of AP and their correspondingly diverse subcellular localization have been recognized in bacteria, little is known about AP in eukaryotic phytoplankton such as dinoflagellates. Here, we isolated a full-length AP cDNA from a latest-diverging dinoflagellate genus Alexandrium, and conducted comparative analyses with homologs from a relatively basal (Amphidinium carterae) and late-diverging (Karenia brevis) lineage of dinoflagellates as well as other eukaryotic algae. New data and previous studies indicate that AP is common in dinoflagellates and most other major eukaryotic groups of phytoplankton. AP sequences are more variable than many other genes studied in dinoflagellates, and are divergent among different eukaryotic phytoplankton lineages. Sequence comparison to the other characterized APs suggests that dinoflagellates and some other eukaryotic phytoplankton possess the putative AP as phoA type, but some other eukaryotic phytoplankton seem to have other types. Phylogenetic analyses based on AP amino acid sequences indicated that the redtype eukaryotic lineages formed a monophyletic group, suggesting a common origin of their APs. As different amino acid sequences have been found to predictably determine different spatial distribution in the cells, which may facilitate access to different pools of DOP, existing computational models were adopted to predict the subcellular localizations of putative AP in the three dinoflagellates and other eukaryotic phytoplankton. Results showed different subcellular localizations of APs in different dinoflagellates and other lineages. The linkage between AP sequence divergence, subcellular localization, and ecological niche differentiation requires rigorous experimental verification, and this study now provides a framework for such a future effort.","2012",NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2012.00235","WOS:000208863600283"
"Cardinale, BJ","Biodiversity improves water quality through niche partitioning","NATURE","Excessive nutrient loading of water bodies is a leading cause of water pollution worldwide(1,2), and controlling nutrient levels in watersheds is a primary objective of most environmental policy(3). Over the past two decades, much research has shown that ecosystems with more species are more efficient at removing nutrients from soil and water than are ecosystems with fewer species(4-7). This has led some to suggest that conservation of biodiversity might be a useful tool for managing nutrient uptake and storage(7-10), but this suggestion has been controversial, in part because the specific biological mechanisms by which species diversity influences nutrient uptake have not been identified(10-12). Here I use a model system of stream biofilms to show that niche partitioning among species of algae can increase the uptake and storage of nitrate, a nutrient pollutant of global concern. I manipulated the number of species of algae growing in the biofilms of 150 stream mesocosms that had been set up to mimic the variety of flow habitats and disturbance regimes that are typical of natural streams. Nitrogen uptake rates, as measured by using N-15-labelled nitrate, increased linearly with species richness and were driven by niche differences among species. As different forms of algae came to dominate each unique habitat in a stream, the more diverse communities achieved a higher biomass and greater N-15 uptake. When these niche opportunities were experimentally removed by making all of the habitats in a stream uniform, diversity did not influence nitrogen uptake, and biofilms collapsed to a single dominant species. These results provide direct evidence that communities with more species take greater advantage of the niche opportunities in an environment, and this allows diverse systems to capture a greater proportion of biologically available resources such as nitrogen. One implication is that biodiversity may help to buffer natural ecosystems against the ecological impacts of nutrient pollution.","2011",NA,"10.1038/nature09904","WOS:000289199400042"

As for many living surfaces in the marine environment, little is known concerning the epiphytic bacterial biofilm communities that inhabit algal surfaces. This study reports on the largest published libraries of near full-length 16S rRNA genes from a marine algal surface (5293 sequences from six samples) allowing for an in-depth assessment of the diversity and phylogenetic profile of the bacterial community on a green Ulvacean alga. Large 16S rRNA gene libraries of surrounding seawater were also used to determine the uniqueness of this bacterial community. The surface of Ulva australis is dominated by sequences of Alphaproteobacteria and the Bacteroidetes, especially within the Rhodobacteriaceae, Sphingomonadaceae, Flavobacteriaceae and Sapropiraceae families. Seawater libraries were also dominated by Alphaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes sequences, but were shown to be clearly distinct from U. australis libraries through the clustering of sequences into operational taxonomic units and Bray-Curtis similarity analysis. Almost no similarity was observed between these two environments at the species level, and only minor similarity was observed at levels of sequence clustering representing clades of bacteria within family and genus taxonomic groups. Variability between libraries of U. australis was relatively high, and a consistent sub-population of bacterial species was not detected. The competitive lottery model, originally derived to explain diversity in coral reef fishes, may explain the pattern of colonization of this algal surface.

Various metrics describing niche overlap, breadth, and position have been developed during the last decades, and these have played a central role in our understanding of community organisation. However, owing to some obvious limitations in these metrics, there is a need for further development of the niche concept to provide new insights into the relationships between species richness (SR), community organisation, and underlying processes. We introduce a new metric, variability in niche positions (VNP) within local communities, describing the extent to which species positions vary in environmentally determined niche space. VNP is measured as the standard deviation of species scores along a multivariate ordination axis calculated over all species in a local community. Regardless of its simplicity, the VNP metric describes novel features in niche differentiation and species locations in environmental niche space. Therefore, it complements other measures, such as niche complementarity and overlap. Based on a few premises about species interactions and body size, we hypothesised that VNP has predictable relationships with SR. The relationships were supported by empirical data on aquatic organisms. Of the studied organism groups, lake fishes showed the strongest VNP-SR relationships, followed by lake molluscs and pond phytoplankton. Stream bryophytes and stream macroinvertebrates also showed significant, yet weak, VNP-SR relationships, but there were no significant relationships in pond zooplankton and stream diatoms. The strength of the VNP-SR relationship showed a positive correlation with the body mass of organisms. Our findings suggest that VNP increases with increasing SR in large-sized organisms. In small-sized organisms, high rates of dispersal may mask a significant relationship between VNP and SR. By contrast, in large-sized organisms, lower rates of dispersal, interspecific interactions, habitat filters, and niches are more important for community organisation. We thus find the new concept as a promising way to aid in linking species richness and niches, but we stress the VNP-SR relationships call for further testing in other communities to see its merits for community ecology.

We previously analyzed the community membership of bacterial communities associated with the green macroalga Ulva australis, and proposed a competitive lottery model for colonization of the algal surface in an attempt to explain the surprising lack of similarity in species composition across different algal samples. Here we extend the previous study by investigating the link between community structure and function in these communities, using metagenomic sequence analysis. Despite the high phylogenetic variability in microbial species composition on different U. australis (only 15% similarity between samples), similarity in functional composition was high (70%), and a core of functional genes present across all algal-associated communities was identified that were consistent with the ecology of surface-and host-associated bacteria. These functions were distributed widely across a variety of taxa or phylogenetic groups. This observation of similarity in habitat (niche) use with respect to functional genes, but not species, together with the relative ease with which bacteria share genetic material, suggests that the key level at which to address the assembly and structure of bacterial communities may not be species (by means of rRNA taxonomy), but rather the more functional level of genes.","2011",NA,"10.1073/pnas.1101591108","WOS:000294163500082"

We tracked fungal abundance, fungal community composition, and soil carbon across 4 years in long-term field manipulations of rainfall in northern California. Fungi responded directly to rainfall levels, with more abundant, diverse, and consistent communities predominating under drought conditions, and less abundant, less diverse, and more variable communities emerging during wetter periods and in rain-addition treatments. Soil carbon storage itself did not vary with rainfall amendments, but increased decomposition rates foreshadow longer-term losses of soil carbon under conditions of extended seasonal rainfall. The repeated recovery of fungal diversity and abundance during periodic drought events suggests that species with a wide range of environmental tolerances coexist in this community, consistent with a storage effect in soil fungi. Increased diversity during dry periods further suggests that drought stress moderates competition among fungal taxa. Based on the responses observed here, we suggest that there may be a relationship between the timescale at which soil microbial communities experience natural environmental fluctuations and their ability to respond to future environmental change.","2011",NA,"10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02327.x","WOS:000287853000011"

The power output from four anode/cathode pairs (modules) along the MFC's length was compared in two different modes of electrical connection (i.e. independently connected and connected in parallel to the loads). Independent connection to resistive loads for each of the four modules produced higher total maximum power generation than parallel connection (6% higher at 0.8 g l(-1)/d and 36% higher at 0.08 g l(-1)/d). The cumulative power production lengthwise along the reactor modules increased to 2.6 mW in the two higher OLRs tested (0.8 and 0.38 g l(-1)/d). However, at lower OLRs, the power tended to saturate at a lower level due to reduced organic concentrations in the later modules. Step perturbation of organic influent concentration from 960 to 22 mg sucrose l(-1) resulted in a delayed voltage decrease, probably due to storage effects in the biofilm on the anode electrode. The power recovery and organic removal could be maximized by extending the number of modules in the longitudinal tubular reactor, which could control effluent quality and power yield, thus facilitating scale-up.","2011",NA,"10.1039/c0ee00073f","WOS:000286891500020"

The effect of inoculation of free whole cell or microencapsulated cells at three points during manufacture (milk before renneting, at cheddaring or at salting) on the viable counts in cheese and whey was investigated. Microencapsulation had no effect on viable counts, chemical parameters (lactose, lactic acid, total nitrogen, nitrogen soluble in TCA, moisture) or sensory properties during manufacturing or storage of the fresh cheeses for 14 days. Inoculation of the bifidobacteria in milk before renneting resulted in higher viable counts in comparison to other points of inoculation. Bifidobacteria added at the salting step, which survived pressing, were subsequently more stable during storage than those inoculated in milk. The stability of B. longum 15708 during storage was greater in the pressed cheeses that in the free curds.

Although 50 percent sugar replacement with an acesulfame-K-dextrose blend, and/or 50 percent fat replacement with dried plum puree, produces acceptable oatmeal and chocolate chip cookies within one day of baking, flavor and texture changes with continued storage are unknown. The purpose of this paper is to profile three oatmeal and chocolate chip cookie formulations. Design/methodology/approach - Three oatmeal and chocolate chip cookie formulations (control, reduced-in-fat (50 percent) and reduced-in-fat and sugar (50 percent)) were profiled 1, 3, 5 and 7 days post-bake by a trained sensory panel (n = 8) using the Spectrumw-approach on 0-15 point linescales; three replicates were obtained. Water activity was determined on six replicates. Data were analyzed with PROC Mixed and PDIFF (p < 0.05). Findings - Water activity increased with modification; increases (aW < 0.60) do not support microbial growth. Day 1 flavor and texture reformulation effects mirror those previously reported. Storage effects across all formulations (p < 0.05) on oatmeal and chocolate chip cookie sensory attributes are within one linescale unit. Different significant (p < 0.05) formulation x storage interactions suggest staling patterns differ with cookie type. Water activity increased during storage for chocolate chip cookies only; practical significance is questionable.

Originality/value - Consumption of products with improved nutritional profiles can assist consumers in bringing their diets in-line with dietary recommendations.

Technical issues (sensory characteristics, nutritional profile and storage convenience) do not appear to limit consumer selection of these reformulated cookies.","2011",NA,"10.1108/00346651111117373","WOS:000213422000004"
"Jeger, MJ; van den Bosch, F; Madden, LV","Modelling virus- and host-limitation in vectored plant disease epidemics","VIRUS RESEARCH","Models of plant virus epidemics have received less attention than those caused by fungal pathogens. Intuitively, the fact that virus diseases are systemic means that the individual diseased plant can be considered as the population unit which simplifies modelling. However, the fact that a vector is required in the vast majority of cases for virus transmission, means that explicit consideration must be taken of the vector, or, the involvement of the vector in the transmission process must be considered implicitly. In the latter case it is also important that within-plant processes, such as virus multiplication and systemic movement, are taken into account. In this paper we propose an approach based on the linking of transmission at the population level with virus multiplication within plants. The resulting models are parameter-sparse and hence simplistic. However, the range of model outcomes is representative of field observations relating to the apparent limitation of epidemic development in populations of healthy susceptible plants. We propose that epidemic development can be constrained by virus limitation in the early stages of an epidemic when the availability of healthy susceptible hosts is not limiting. There is an inverse relationship between levels of transmission in the population and the mean virus titre/infected plant. In the case of competition between viruses, both virus and host limitation are likely to be important in determining whether one virus can displace another or whether both viruses can co-exist in a plant population. Lotka-Volterra type equations are derived to describe density-dependent competition between two viruses multiplying within plants, embedded within a population level epidemiological model. Explicit expressions determining displacement or co-existence of the viruses are obtained. Unlike the classical Lotka-Volterra competition equations, the co-existence requirement for the competition coefficients to be both less than 1 can be relaxed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We based our model on empirically measured quantities, minimal ecological assumptions and stochastic processes. In nature, we found aggregated patterns of species biovolume (i.e. clumps) along the volume axis and a peak in species richness. Both patterns were reproduced by the MLVC model. Observed clumps corresponded to niche zones (volumes) where species fitness was highest, or where fitness was equal among competing species.

R. venosa and the whitemouth croaker, Micropogonias furnieri, exhibited a high level of niche overlap (91%), while C. fluminea exhibited a high level of niche overlap with Mytilidae (94%), which suggests in both cases high levels of competition for similar resources. R. venosa had mixed trophic impacts but exhibited a predominantly top down effect on most bivalves. R. venosa could be a threat to natural resources in the area including to the fishing fleets. C. fluminea negatively influenced phytoplankton and detritus biomass and its positive effects on higher trophic level groups suggest a central bottom-up role in the food web as a bentho-pelagic coupler.

At a given cell size, competitive abilities for N and P are negatively correlated, but as cell size increases, competitive ability decreases for both nutrients. The relative importance of the two trade-off axes appears to be environment dependent, suggesting different selective pressures: freshwater phytoplankton separate more along the N vs. P competition axis, and marine phytoplankton separate more along the nutrient competition vs. cell size axis.

"Gerla, DJ; Mooij, WM; Huisman, J","Photoinhibition and the assembly of light-limited phytoplankton communities","OIKOS","Photoinhibition is characterised by a decreasing rate of photosynthesis with increasing light. It occurs in many photosynthetic organisms and is especially apparent in phytoplankton species sensitive to high light. Yet, the population and community level consequences of photoinhibition are not well understood. Here, we present a resource competition model that includes photoinhibition. The model shows that, in strong light, photoinhibition leads to an increase of the specific growth rate with increasing population density due to self-shading. This so-called Allee effect can be either weak or strong. In monoculture, a strong Allee effect results in two alternative stable states. A low population density does not provide sufficient shade to protect itself against photoinhibition, such that the population goes extinct. Conversely, above a threshold population density the population may create sufficiently turbid conditions to suppress photoinhibition, so that the population can establish itself. When several species compete for light, a species which cannot establish itself due to photoinhibition can be facilitated by other species less sensitive to photoinhibition. If such facilitators are absent, photoinhibition may cause alternative stable states in community composition. Since each alternative stable state is dominated by a single species, photoinhibition does not favour species coexistence.

Using tick infestation data on roe deer, we analysed preferred attachment sites and niche width of Ixodes ticks (larvae, nymphs, males, females) and investigated the degree of inter- and intrastadial aggregation. The different development stages showed rather consistent attachment site patterns and relative narrow feeding site niches. Larvae were mostly found on the head and on the front legs of roe deer, nymphs reached highest densities on the head and highest adult densities were found on the neck of roe deer. The tick stages feeding (larvae, nymphs, females) on roe deer showed high degrees of intrastadial spatial aggregation, whereas males did not. Male ticks showed large feeding site overlap with female ticks. Feeding site overlap between larval-female and larval-nymphal ticks did occur especially during the months May-August on the head and front legs of roe deer and might allow pathogen transmission via co-feeding. Tick density, niche width and niche overlap on roe deer are mainly affected by seasonality, reflecting seasonal activity and abundance patterns of ticks. Since different tick development stages occur spatially and temporally clustered on roe deer, transmission experiments of tick-borne pathogens are urgently needed.","2011",NA,"10.1007/s10493-010-9378-4","WOS:000284651000009"

Climate warming is assumed to increase soil nutrient availability through enhancing mineralization of soil organic matter in a variety of terrestrial ecosystems. However, few studies have yet examined how dominant plant species contribute to species coexistence when nutrient enrichment occurs in native ecosystems. We studied a single fairy ring (5 m diameter) in a Kobresia meadow in the Tibetan Plateau. This kind of rings is caused by a basidiomycete fungus Agaricus campestris, and is evidenced by dark-green vegetation boundaries. Nutrient enrichment occurs due to enhanced decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) in the fungus growth zone of these rings. We conducted a short-term N-15 labelling experiment and found that dominant plant species shifted their N uptake patterns and preferred N form (NO (3) (-) , NH (4) (+) , and amino acid N) in response to nutrient enrichment in an N-limited alpine meadow. The legume Gueldenstaedtia diversifolia had the lowest aboveground biomass among the five plant species studied at low available N level, although it mainly utilized ammonium (the most abundant N form). The two graminoids (Elymus nutans and Stipa aliena) demonstrated similar aboveground biomass at low and high available N levels, showing a similar pattern switching from NH (4) (+) /NO (3) (-) uptake outside the ring to glycine uptake in the annulus zone of the ring. The biomass of the forb Gentiana straminea differed significantly at low and high available N levels, but its N uptake pattern almost remained unchanged. Species therefore differed in their response to nutrient enrichment, most species showing chemical niche shifts instead of niche conservatism. This finding has important implications with regard to understanding the mechanisms responsible for species coexistence when natural nutrient enrichment is induced by climate warming in terrestrial ecosystems.","2011",NA,"10.1007/s11104-010-0662-1","WOS:000288455300038"

However, empirical studies testing for the presence of a competition-colonization (CC) trade-off and its importance for species coexistence have found mixed results. In a microcosm experiment, we looked for a CC trade-off in a community of six benthic ciliate species. For each species, we measured the time needed to actively disperse to and colonize an empty microcosm. By measuring dispersal rates and growth rates of the species, we were able to differentiate between these two important components of colonization ability. Competitive ability was investigated by comparing species' growth with or without a competitor in all pairwise species combinations. Species significantly differed in their colonization abilities, with good colonizers having either high growth rates or high dispersal rates or both. Although species showed a clear competitive hierarchy, competitive and colonization ability were uncorrelated. The weakest competitors were also the weakest colonizers, and the strongest competitor was an intermediate colonizer. However, some of the inferior competitors had higher colonization abilities than the strongest competitor, indicating that a CC trade-off may enable coexistence for a subset of the species. Absence of a community-wide CC trade-off may be based on the lack of strong relationships between the traits underlying competitive and colonization ability. We show that temporal effects and differential resource use are alternative mechanisms of coexistence for the species that were both slow colonizers and poor competitors.","2011",NA,"10.1007/s00442-011-2013-1","WOS:000295984800013"

Particulate organic matter isotopic signatures presented a gradient from the river towards the sea. Phytoplankton, zooplankton, polychaetes and the crab, Polybius henslowii, provided evidence of the incorporation of terrestrial organic matter into the lower levels of the food web, reflecting local isotopic signatures. Two fish species reflected the coastal isotopic gradient in delta C-13, Diplodus vulgaris and Arnoglossus imperialis and the latter also presented isotopic differerences among the sites for delta N-15. Alloteuthis subulata, Trisopterus luscus and Callionymus lyra were isotopicaly distinct among sites for delta N-15. An increase of delta N-15 with length was detected for T luscus and C. lyra, possibly showing ontogenic trophic level changes. Since A. subulata did not present differences in length and still showed isotopic distinction for delta N-15, among areas, it was concluded that local biogeochemical factors may also have an influence. Diplodus bellottii and Dicologlossa cuneata did not reflect any isotopic signature reflecting their wide migration and feeding across the coastal area. Central isotopic ranges, defined as the site mean values for delta C-13 and delta N-15 +/- 1 parts per thousand were determined for each species and site and those deviating from these were considered transient individuals. Central isotopic ranges accounted for 87% of A. imperialis, 80% of A. subulata, 77% of T luscus, 67% of C. lyra and 50% of D. vulgaris. The number of individuals within each central isotopic range was surprisingly high for an open coastal area and comparable to those of more structured environments. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A key abiotic feature of forests is regular canopy disturbances that create temporary patches, or gaps, of above-average light availability. Co-occurring in lowland primary forest of Korup National Park (Cameroon), Microberlinia bisulcata and Tetraberlinia bifoliolata are locally dominant, ectomycorrhizal trees whose seeds share predator guilds in masting years. Here, we experimentally tested the impact of small mammal predators upon seedling abundance, growth, and survivorship. In 2007, we added a fixed density of seeds of each species to exclosures at 48 gap-understory locations across 82.5 ha within a large Microberlinia grove, and at 15 locations outside it. For both species, small mammals removed more seeds in gaps than in understory, whereas this was reversed for seeds killed by invertebrates. Nonetheless, Microberlinia lost twice as many seeds to small mammals, and more to invertebrates in exclosures, than Tetraberlinia, which was more prone to a pathogenic white fungus. After six weeks, both species had greater seedling establishment in gaps than understory, and in exclosures outside compared to exclosures inside the grove. In the subsequent two-year period, seedling growth and survivorship peaked in exclosures in gaps, but Microberlinia had more seedlings' stems clipped by animals than Tetraberlinia, and more than twice the percentage of leaf area damaged. Whereas Microberlinia seedling performance in gaps was inferior to Tetraberlinia inside the grove, outside it Microberlinia had reduced leaf damage, grew taller, and had many more leaves than Tetraberlinia. No evidence was found for apparent mutualism in the understory as seedling establishment of both species increased away from (>25 m) large stems of either species, pointing to apparent competition instead. In gaps, Microberlinia seedling establishment was lower near Tetraberlinia than conspecific adults because of context-dependent small mammal satiation. Stage-matrix analysis suggested that protecting Microberlinia from small mammals could increase its population growth rate by 0.06. In the light of prior research we conclude that small mammals and canopy gaps play an important role in promoting species coexistence in this forest, and that their strong interaction contributes to Microberlinia's currently very poor regeneration.","2011",NA,"10.1890/10-2268.1","WOS:000293457300004"

Despite showing a high NOI (> 0.9), significant differences existed in the substrate utilization capabilities of the isolates suggesting that either a high degree of niche specialization or mechanisms allowing for non-competitive co-existence, were present within this ecological context.

Populations that evolved with interspecific competition had smaller cell sizes, produced fewer cysts and had higher population growth rates relative to populations grown in monoculture. The presence of interspecific competitors led to differential lineage sorting, most likely by increasing the strength of selection. These results are the first to demonstrate protozoan evolution in response to competition and may have implications for species coexistence in this system.","2011",NA,"10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.02140.x","WOS:000285418500004"

A series of batch experiments was performed from sucrose at different initial pH from 4 to 6. As expected, the highest H-2 production potentials (H-max) and rates (R-max) were obtained at the highest pH. Changes in batch performances were clearly associated with shifts in the hydA diversity and structure. In contrast, 16S rDNA-based fingerprints were less sensitive to changes in H-2 production performances. The H-max was related to lower hydA diversity, with Clostridium sporogenes as the major H-2 producer. Communities harboring larger hydA diversities were found in experiments with the higher R-max, suggesting that species coexistence may have positive effects on H-2 production.

When information is asymmetric (the quality of a potential partner is known only to himself), it may seem that partner choice is not possible without signaling. Many mutualisms, however, exist without signaling, and the mechanisms by which hosts might select the right partners are unclear. Here we propose a general mechanism of partner choice, screening, that is similar to the economic theory of mechanism design. Imposing the appropriate costs and rewards may induce the informed individuals to screen themselves according to their types and therefore allow a noninformed individual to establish associations with the correct partners in the absence of signaling. Several types of biological symbioses are good candidates for screening, including bobtail squid, ant-plants, gut microbiomes, and many animal and plant species that produce reactive oxygen species. We describe a series of diagnostic tests for screening. Screening games can apply to the cases where by-products, partner fidelity feedback, or host sanctions do not apply, therefore explaining the evolution of mutualism in systems where it is impossible for potential symbionts to signal their cooperativeness beforehand and where the host does not punish symbiont misbehavior.","2011",NA,"10.1086/657622","WOS:000285136700010"

However, most experimental studies have found that nutrient enhancements depress diversity regardless of whether nutrients are uniformly or heterogeneously applied. This mismatch between theory and empirical pattern is potentially due to an interaction between plant size and the scale of resource heterogeneity. Clonal plants that spread vegetatively via rhizomes or stolons can grow large and may integrate across resource patches, thus reducing the positive effect of small-scale resource heterogeneity on plant species richness. Many rhizomatous clonal species respond strongly to increased soil fertility, and they have been hypothesized to drive the descending arm of the hump-shaped productivity-diversity relationship in grasslands. We tested whether clonals reduce species richness in a grassland community by manipulating nutrient heterogeneity, soil fertility, and the presence of rhizomatous clonal species in a 6-year field experiment. We found strong and consistent negative effects of clonals on species richness. These effects were greatest at high fertility and when soil resources were applied at a scale at which rhizomatous clonals could integrate across resource patches.

These behaviors can have a significant impact on biodiversity. Addressing the role of migration in biodiversity microscopically is fundamental but remains a challenging problem in interdisciplinary science. We incorporate both intra-and inter-patch migrations in stochastic games of cyclic competitions and find that the interplay between the migrations at the local and global scales can lead to robust species coexistence characterized dynamically by the occurrence of remarkable target-wave patterns in the absence of any external control. The waves can emerge from either mixed populations or isolated species in different patches, regardless of the size and the location of the migration target. We also find that, even in a single-species system, target waves can arise from rare mutations, leading to an outbreak of biodiversity. A surprising phenomenon is that target waves in different patches can exhibit synchronization and time-delayed synchronization, where the latter potentially enables the prediction of future evolutionary dynamics. We provide a physical theory based on the spatiotemporal organization of the target waves to explain the synchronization phenomena. We also investigate the basins of coexistence and extinction to establish the robustness of biodiversity through migrations. Our results are relevant to issues of general and broader interest such as pattern formation, control in excitable systems, and the origin of order arising from self-organization in social and natural systems.","2011",NA,"10.1103/PhysRevE.83.011917","WOS:000286762800003"

By saving on inherent costs, individuals that do not contribute socially have a selective advantage over altruists if both types receive equal benefits. Restrained consumption of a common resource is a form of altruism. The cost of this kind of prudent behavior is that restrained individuals give up resources to less-restrained individuals. The benefit of restraint is that better resource management may prolong the persistence of the group. One way to dodge the problem of defection is for altruists to interact disproportionately with other altruists. With limited dispersal, restrained individuals persist because of interaction with like types, whereas it is the unrestrained individuals that must face the negative long-term consequences of their rapacity. Here, we study the evolution of restraint in a community of three competitors exhibiting a nontransitive (rock-paper-scissors) relationship. The nontransitivity ensures a form of negative feedback, whereby improvement in growth of one competitor has the counterintuitive consequence of lowering the density of that improved player. This negative feedback generates detrimental long-term consequences for unrestrained growth. Using both computer simulations and evolution experiments with a nontransitive community of Escherichia coli, we find that restrained growth can evolve under conditions of limited dispersal in which negative feedback is present. This research, thus, highlights a set of ecological conditions sufficient for the evolution of one form of altruism.","2011",NA,"10.1073/pnas.1100296108","WOS:000292137100007"

Theory predicts that if essential resources are heterogeneously distributed across a metacommunity, single species may dominate productivity in individual metacommunity patches, but a mixture of species will maximize productivity across the whole metacommunity. It also predicts that a balanced supply of resources within local patches should favor species coexistence, whereas resource imbalance would favor the dominance of one species. We performed an experiment with five freshwater algal species to study the effects of total supply of resources, their ratios, and species richness on biovolume production and evenness at the scale of both local patches and metacommunities. Generally, algal biovolume increased, whereas algal resource use efficiency (RUE) and evenness decreased with increasing total supply of resources in mixed communities containing all five species. In contrast to predictions for biovolume production, the species mixtures did not outperform all monocultures at the scale of metacommunities. In other words, we observed no general transgressive overyielding. However, RUE was always higher in mixtures than predicted from monocultures, and analyses indicate that resource partitioning or facilitation in mixtures resulted in higher-than-expected productivity at high resource supply. Contrasting our predictions for the local scale, balanced supply of resources did not generally favor higher local evenness, however lowest evenness was confined to patches with the most imbalanced supply. Thus, our study provides mixed support for recent theoretical advancements to understand biodiversity-productivity relationships.","2011",NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0021972","WOS:000292632000043"

However, only stumps present such a role in managed forests. The aim of this study was to assess the differences in the process of seedling colonization between logs and stumps. The study was carried out ill the Czech Republic, in two old-growth subalpine spruce forests located in the Bohemian Forest and Ash Mts., dominated by Athyrium distentifolium Opiz and Vaccinium myrtillus L. undergrowth, respectively. Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) regeneration growing on logs, stumps and non-coarse woody debris (CWD) microsites was surveyed. Regeneration (height 0-2.0 m) densities exceeded 5000 individuals per ha on both sites. The average density of P. abies regeneration per square meter of substrate was 0.3-5.7-19.6 and 0.5-3.8-11.0 on non-CWD microsites, logs and stumps, located in A. distentifolium and V myrtillus undergrowth, respectively. Stumps and non-CWD microsites dominated by V myrtillus, supported a higher proportion of taller seedlings per plot compared to the small seedlings growing on logs and non-CWD dominated by A. distentifolium ground-cover. The disproportion in regeneration densities between the stumps and the original logs decreased with increasing stages of decay. The tallest regeneration growing on stumps (root-soil plates) was significantly older than that growing on the logs (stems). Based on these two latter findings, the stumps appeared to provide suitable seedling substrates several years earlier than the logs did. Therefore, we conclude that the stumps play a more important role (relative to their covered area, 21-28 m(2)ha(-1)) in terms of suitable microsites for regeneration, than the logs do.","2011",NA,"10.14214/sf.87","WOS:000300809800018"

"Neher, RA; Shraiman, BI","Genetic Draft and Quasi-Neutrality in Large Facultatively Sexual Populations","GENETICS","Large populations may contain numerous simultaneously segregating polymorphisms subject to natural selection. Since selection acts on individuals whose fitness depends on many loci, different loci affect each other's dynamics. This leads to stochastic fluctuations of allele frequencies above and beyond genetic drift-an effect known as genetic draft. Since recombination disrupts associations between alleles, draft is strong when recombination is rare. Here, we study a facultatively outcrossing population in a regime where the frequency of outcrossing and recombination, r, is small compared to the characteristic scale of fitness differences sigma. In this regime, fit genotypes expand clonally, leading to large fluctuations in the number of recombinant offspring genotypes. The power law tail in the distribution of the latter makes it impossible to capture the dynamics of draft by an effective neutral model. Instead, we find that the fixation time of a neutral allele increases only slowly with the population size but depends sensitively on the ratio r/sigma. The efficacy of selection is reduced dramatically and alleles behave quasi-neutrally even for Ns >> 1, provided that vertical bar s vertical bar < s(c), where s(c) depends strongly on r/sigma, but only weakly on population size N. In addition, the anomalous fluctuations due to draft change the spectrum of (quasi)-neutral alleles from f(nu) similar to nu(-1), corresponding to drift, to similar to nu(-2). Finally, draft accelerates the rate of two-step adaptations through deleterious intermediates.","2011",NA,"10.1534/genetics.111.128876","WOS:000293700000019"
"Schuster, P","Physical Principles of Evolution","PRINCIPLES OF EVOLUTION: FROM THE PLANCK EPOCH TO COMPLEX MULTICELLULAR LIFE","Theoretical biology is incomplete without a comprehensive theory of evolution, since evolution is at the core of biological thought. Evolution is visualized as a migration process in genotype or sequence space that is either an adaptive walk driven by some fitness gradient or a random walk in the absence of (sufficiently large) fitness differences. The Darwinian concept of natural selection consisting in the interplay of variation and selection is based on a dichotomy: All variations occur on genotypes whereas selection operates on phenotypes, and relations between genotypes and phenotypes, as encapsulated in a mapping from genotype space into phenotype space, are central to an understanding of evolution. Fitness is conceived as a function of the phenotype, represented by a second mapping from phenotype space into nonnegative real numbers. In the biology of organisms, genotype phenotype maps are enormously complex and relevant information on them is exceedingly scarce. The situation is better in the case of viruses but so far only one example of a genotype phenotype map, the mapping of RNA sequences into RNA secondary structures, has been investigated in sufficient detail. It provides direct information on RNA selection in vitro and test-tube evolution, and it is a basis for testing in silk evolution on a realistic fitness landscape. Most of the modeling efforts in theoretical and mathematical biology today are done by means of differential equations but stochastic effects are of undeniably great importance for evolution. Population sizes are much smaller than the numbers of genotypes constituting sequence space. Every mutant, after all, has to begin with a single copy. Evolution can be modeled by a chemical master equation, which (in principle) can be approximated by a stochastic differential equation. In addition, simulation tools are available that compute trajectories for master equations. The accessible population sizes in the range of 10(7) <= N <= 10(8) molecules are commonly too small for problems in chemistry but sufficient for biology.","2011",NA,"10.1007/978-3-642-18137-5_2","WOS:000292617100002"

However, little is known about the causes of this diversity. On the one hand, the apparent coexistence of closely related species may be explained by the traditional niche differentiation hypothesis, which suggests that abiotic and/or biotic factors mediate partitioning. For endophytes, such factors are difficult to identify, and are therefore in most cases unknown. On the other hand, there is the neutral hypothesis, which suggests that stochastic factors may explain high species diversity. There is a need to investigate to what extent each of these hypotheses may apply to endophytes. Results: The niche partitioning of two closely related fungal endophytes, Microdochium bolleyi and M. phragmitis, colonizing Phragmites australis, was investigated. The occurrences of each species were assessed using specific nested-PCR assays for 251 field samples of common reed from Lake Constance, Germany. These analyses revealed niche preferences for both fungi. From three niche factors assessed, i.e. host habitat, host organ and season, host habitat significantly differentiated the two species. M. bolleyi preferred dry habitats, whereas M. phragmitis prevailed in flooded habitats. In contrast, both species exhibited a significant preference for the same host organ, i.e. roots. Likewise the third factor, season, did not significantly distinguish the two species. Differences in carbon utilization and growth temperature could not conclusively explain the niches. The inclusion of three unrelated species of Ascomycota, which also colonize P. australis at the same locations, indicated spatio-temporal niche partitioning between all fungi. None of the species exhibited the same preferences for all three factors, i.e. host habitat, host organ, and time of the season. Conclusions: The fungal species colonizing common reed investigated in this study seem to exploit niche differences leading to a separation in space and time, which may allow for their coexistence on the same host.

We tested the hypothesis that soil contamination with petroleum hydrocarbons (PHCs) alters spatial patterns of ecto- (ECM) and ericoid (ERM) mycorrhizal fungal and root-associated bacterial community structure in the shared rhizosphere of pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) and lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea) in reconstructed sub-boreal forest soils. Pine seeds and lingonberry cuttings were planted into containers with an organic (mor humus, FH or coarse woody debris, CWD) layer overlying sandy mineral horizons (Ae and Bf) of forest soils collected from field sites in central British Columbia, Canada. After 4 months, 219 mg cm(-2) crude oil was applied to the soil surface of half of the systems; systems were sampled 1 or 16 weeks later. Composition, relative abundance and vertical distribution of pine ECMs were assessed using light microscopy; community profiles were generated using LH-PCR of ribosomal DNA. Multivariate analysis revealed that plant and soil factors were more important determinants of community composition than was crude oil treatment. Fungal communities differed between pine and lingonberry roots; ECM communities were structured by soil layer whereas ERM communities varied between FH and CWD soil systems. Bacterial communities varied between plants and soil layers, indicating properties of ECM and ERM rhizospheres and the soil environment influence bacterial niche differentiation. This integration of mycorrhizal and bacterial community analysis contributes to a greater understanding of forest soil sustainability in forest ecosystems potentially contaminated with PHCs.","2011",NA,"10.1007/s11104-011-0802-2","WOS:000293967500010"

Our aims are (a) to recapitulate the history of stable isotope research in soil animals with a focus on oribatid mites, (b) to present new stable isotope data for oribatid mites and overview the current state of knowledge of oribatid mite trophic niche differentiation, (c) to compile problems and limitations of stable isotope based analyses of trophic relationships and (d) to suggest future challenges, questions and problems that may be solved using stable isotope analyses and other novel techniques for improving our understanding on the trophic ecology of soil invertebrates. We conclude that (1) in addition to N-15/N-14 ratios, C-13/C-12 ratios contribute to our understanding of the trophic ecology of oribatid mites, allowing, e.g. separation of lichen- and moss-feeding species, (2) there likely are many lichen but few moss feeding oribatid mite species, (3) oribatid mite species that are endophagous as juveniles are separated by their stable isotope signatures from all other oribatid mite species, (4) fungivorous oribatid mite species cannot be separated further, e.g. the fungal taxa they feed on cannot be delineated. A particular problem in using stable isotope data is the difficulty in determining signatures for basal food resources, since decomposing material, fungi and lichens comprise various components differing in stable isotope signatures: C-13/C-12 ratios and potentially other isotopes may help in identifying the role of these resources for decomposer animal nutrition.

Based on the suggested niche differentiation between these two groups and findings that they are susceptible to environmental change in soil ecosystems at varying scales, we suggest that the abundance of these two communities rather than community profiling of the ammonia oxidizing bacteria could serve as a relevant and cost-effective bioindicator for soil monitoring.

In this study we investigate ecological conditions that may promote the long-term maintenance of virulence polymorphisms in pathogen populations. Recent theory predicts that evolution towards increased virulence can be reversed if less-aggressive social 'cheats' exploit more aggressive 'cooperator' pathogens. However, there is no evidence that social exploitation operates within natural pathogen populations. We show that for the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae, major polymorphisms for pathogenicity are maintained at unexpectedly high frequencies in populations infecting the host Arabidopsis thaliana. Experiments reveal that less-aggressive strains substantially increase their growth potential in mixed infections and have a fitness advantage in non-host environments. These results suggest that niche differentiation can contribute to the maintenance of virulence polymorphisms, and that both within-host and between-host growth rates modulate cheating and cooperation in P. syringae populations.","2011",NA,"10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01687.x","WOS:000296263200010"

These communities are uniformly sensitive to top-down controls and exhibit rapid changes in plant composition when the intensity and frequency of these controls are altered. These changes are intensifying due to the suite of global change factors, including the continued presence and introduction of new plant species. Establishment of nonnative plant species into grasslands requires resource opportunities generated by natural and human-induced disturbances and by niche differences of the new species. Persistence and spatial expansion require that the traits of the introduced species be compatible with a new regime of competitors, predators, pathogens, and symbionts. Plant traits of the invaders may then further facilitate the invasion process by preempting resources or by restructuring the soil microbial community and trophic food web in ways that directly or indirectly benefit the invading species.","2011",NA,"10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-102710-145057","WOS:000299438300007"

The predominant sulfide oxidizers of three different mats were identified by microscopic and phylogenetic analyses as (i) Arcobacter species producing cotton-ball-like sulfur precipitates, (ii) large filamentous sulfur bacteria including Beggiatoa species, and (iii) single, spherical Thiomargarita species. High resolution in situ microprofiles revealed different geochemical settings selecting for the different mat types. Arcobacter mats occurred where oxygen and sulfide overlapped above the seafloor in the bottom water interface. Filamentous sulfide oxidizers were associated with steep gradients of oxygen and sulfide in the sediment. A dense population of Thiomargarita was favored by temporarily changing supplies of oxygen and sulfide in the bottom water. These results indicate that the decisive factors in selecting for different mat-forming bacteria within one deep-sea province are spatial or temporal variations in energy supply. Furthermore, the occurrence of Arcobacter spp.-related 16S rRNA genes in the sediments below all three types of mats, as well as on top of brine lakes of the NDSF, indicates that this group of sulfide oxidizers can switch between different life modes depending on the geobiochemical habitat setting.","2011",NA,"10.1111/j.1472-4669.2011.00281.x","WOS:000294172700004"

Here, we examined in a common garden experiment with wild tall fescue plants and the agronomic cultivar Kentucky 31, whether infection by Neotyphodium coenophialum, the genetic background (origin) of the host plant, abiotic factors, and their interactions affected the invertebrate communities living on tall fescue. We collected a total of 18650 invertebrates from the 480 tall fescue plants, identified them to 97 morphological taxa (mainly to family level) representing five feeding guilds (herbivores, detritivores, omnivores, predators and parasitoids). In contrast to past literature, endophyte infection did not affect abundances of any taxon or feeding guild, or taxonomic diversity and the composition of the invertebrate community. Instead, the invertebrate community of native tall fescue appears to be primarily driven by environmental conditions and niche differentiation among taxonomical groups of invertebrates.

"Jabbour, R; Crowder, DW; Aultman, EA; Snyder, WE","Entomopathogen biodiversity increases host mortality","BIOLOGICAL CONTROL","In biological control communities, greater predator species richness often strengthens pest suppression. The impacts and importance of species richness in insect-killing pathogen (entomopathogen) communities, however, has received less attention. Here, we manipulated species richness within a community of three soil-dwelling entomopathogenic nematodes (Heterorhabditis megidis, Steinernema carpocapsae, Steinernema feltiae) and one fungus (Beauveria bassiana), and measured resulting effects on mortality of Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) and wax moth (Galleria mellonella) hosts. When potato beetles were the focal host, increasing pathogen species richness led to a linear increase in host mortality. This diversity effect appeared to result primarily from the pairing of nematodes and fungus within diverse communities; these pairings always produced host mortality that exceeded predictions based on the impact of nematodes or fungus alone. We then conducted an experiment using wax moth as the focal host, because this allowed greater replication, and included two different soil types to see if changing the foraging environment altered niche differences (and thus complementarity) among pathogen species. We again found an increase in host mortality at higher pathogen richness levels due to the apparent nematode-fungus synergism, and this effect was detected across both soil types. Our findings suggest that the positive effects of species richness commonly observed among predator species may extend to pathogen communities as well, such that conserving pathogen biodiversity may carry additional benefits for biological control.

We, therefore, studied the spatial distribution patterns of different heterotrophic bacteria, picocyanobacteria, and the dominant primary producer, the filamentous cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens, in a large, canyon-shaped, prealpine lake (Lake Zurich, Switzerland), in six vertical profiles along a 21.7-km longitudinal transect. Highest total densities and proportions of cells with high nucleic acid content were in the warm epilimnion and the hypoxic zone of the hypolimnion. P. rubescens formed a dense layer in the metalimnion throughout the lake, whereas picocyanobacteria populated the water layers above. The epilimnion was mainly inhabited by ultramicrobacteria related to the LD12-lineage of Alphaproteobacteria and to Actinobacteria; the latter group preferred the shallow regions. Cytophaga-Flavobacteria, in particular a population related to Fluviicola sp. were more frequent in and below the layer of maximal P. rubescens abundances. Betaproteobacteria, on the other hand, were highly abundant in the epi- and hypolimnion, but not in the P. rubescens layer. Four betaproteobacterial subpopulations with contrasting longitudinal and/or vertical habitat preferences were distinguished: putatively methylotrophic bacteria of the LD28 lineage (beta IV) preferentially inhabited the hypolimnion, Polynucleobacter acidiphobus was found throughout the epilimnion, Limnohabitans (R-BT065) more in the shallow regions of the lake, and Polynucleobacter necessarius ssp. asymbioticus only in hypoxic waters.

Representatives of these ecotypes fall within two to three 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) clades for the former and one for the latter. However, clade distributions and relationships to this form of niche partitioning are unknown in nature. We developed two quantitative PCR primer-probe sets and enumerated the proposed ecotypes in the Pacific Ocean as well as the subtropical and tropical North Atlantic. Statistical differences in factors such as salinity, temperature and NO(3) indicated the ecophysiological parameters behind clade distributions are more complex than irradiance alone. Clade OII, containing the putatively low-light adapted strains, was detected at warm oligotrophic sites. In contrast, Clade OI, containing high-light adapted strains, was present in cooler mesotrophic and coastal waters. Maximal OI abundance (19 555 +/- 37 18S rDNA copies per ml) was detected in mesotrophic waters at 40m depth, approaching the nutricline. OII was often more abundant at the deep chlorophyll maximum, when nutrient concentrations were significantly higher than at the surface (stratified euphotic zone waters). However, in mixed euphotic-zone water columns, relatively high numbers (for example, 891 +/- 107 18S rDNA copies per ml, Sargasso Sea, springtime) were detected at the surface. Both Clades OI and OII were found at multiple euphotic zone depths, but co-occurrence at the same geographical location appeared rare and was detected only in continental slope waters.

Studies of functional-based ecology, however, have been limited for zooplankton and particularly for rotifers. While rotifers show a variety of trophi types and coronal shapes, suggesting the importance of niche differentiation in their feeding strategy, relatively little is known of how this relates to rotifer dynamics. We used the guild ratio (GR', a ratio of raptorial to microphagous species), an index based on a functional trait (i.e. feeding strategy), as a novel approach to rotifer dynamics. We extracted the seasonal GR' by using seasonal trend decomposition and investigated similarities between study sites (Lake Washington, USA and Lake Caldonazzo, Italy) and its relation to cladocerans by cross-correlation analysis. Our study indicated that (i) raptorial and microphagous rotifers showed alternating dominance, and that raptorial rotifers and cladocerans had a synchronous pattern, (ii) the seasonal pattern of the GR' was consistent across different sampling frequencies, and (iii) the GR' was similar in both lakes. We interpreted these patterns as the general strength of the GR': discernment of species-environment relationships and robustness across sampling regimes. The limitations of the GR' (i.e. species identity is neglected, simplification of food preferences) can also be seen as its strong point: synthesis of multi-species patterns. In addition, the independence of GR' from species-level identification and its potential to make use of datasets with infrequent sampling intervals and low taxon resolution could further support its innovative aspect.","2011",NA,"10.1007/s10750-010-0491-5","WOS:000284960500020"

Thus it is not known whether temporal and spatial differences in microbial community composition are linked to particular environmental factors or might modulate ecosystem response to environmental change. Fifty-three water and sediment samples from upper and lower Chesapeake Bay were analysed in triplicate arrays to determine temporal and spatial patterns and relationships between ammonia-oxidizing bacterial (AOB) communities and environmental variables. Thirty-three water samples (three depths) collected during April, August and October, 2001-2004, from the oligohaline upper region of the Bay were analysed to investigate temporal patterns in archetype distribution. Using a combination of a non-weighted discrimination analysis and principal components analysis of community composition data obtained from functional gene microarrays, it was found that co-varying AOB assemblages reoccurred seasonally in concert with specific environmental conditions, potentially revealing patterns of niche differentiation. Among the most notable patterns were correlations of AOB archetypes with temperature, DON and ammonium concentrations. Different AOB archetypes were more prevalent at certain times of the year, e.g. some were more abundant every autumn and others every spring.

Here we investigate the flow of C and N through the soil food web as a way to gain understanding of the feeding interactions occurring. A bacterium, Pseudomonas lurida, was introduced to soil cores from two different habitats, a grassland and a woodland with the same soil type, enriched to 99 atom% in C-13 and N-15, to trace the flow of bacterial C and N through the soil food web. Throughout the experiment the soil remained enriched in C-13 and N-15. Almost all the invertebrates tested gained C and N enrichment indicative of the labelled bacteria, implying that bacterial feeding is a common mechanism within the soil. Only three groups were significantly enriched in both C-13 and N-15 in both habitats. These were Collembola (Entomobryomorpha), Acari (Oribatida), and Nematoda, indicating that these organisms are consuming the most bacteria within both systems. When the invertebrates were grouped into hypothesised trophic levels, those considered secondary decomposers were gaining the most enrichment across all invertebrates tested. This enrichment was also high in the micro-predators within the soil, implying that their main food source was the secondary decomposers, particularly the Collembola. Using an enriched bacterium to track the trophic transfer between organisms within the soil food web is a novel way of empirically showing that interactions are occurring, which normally cannot be seen.

We establish the conditions under which a multi-strain endemic state is invaded by another strain which is both directly and environmentally transmitted. We discuss explicit forms for environmental transmission terms and apply our newly derived invasion conditions to a two-strain system. Then, we consider the case of two strains with matching basic reproduction numbers (i.e., R-0), one directly transmitted only and the other both directly and environmentally transmitted, invading each other's endemic state. We find that the strain which is only directly transmitted can invade the endemic state of the strain with mixed transmission. However, the endemic state of the first strain is neutrally stable to invasion by the second strain. Thus, our results suggest that environmental transmission makes the endemic state less resistant to invasion. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Most studies of species abundance patterns focus on conspicuous macroorganisms while microbial communities remain relatively understudied. This bias is a concern given the functional importance and high diversity of microbes. 2. We determine whether a common species abundance distribution (SAD) is observed in communities of a widespread group of soil microbes, the Glomeromycota or arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Using molecular techniques, we intensively sampled the AM fungal community of a woodland-grassland ecotone in Yorkshire, UK. Observed species abundances were compared to theoretical models describing SADs. We also reanalysed 32 previously published data sets in a similar manner. 3. Species abundance distributions in all the AM fungal communities fitted both lognormal and broken-stick models. However, these models consistently and significantly underpredicted the abundance of the most abundant AM fungal taxon. We found that AM fungal communities are typically dominated by a single taxon; representing on average 40% of total abundance within the community. Phylogenetic analysis of the most abundant taxa across data sets showed that the dominant AM fungal type in each community was different and not a widespread generalist. 4. We conclude that a common community structure is present in AM fungal communities from different habitats. The fit to log-normal and broken-stick models suggests the influence of niche differentiation structuring these communities. However, the consistently observed overdominance indicates that local adaptation and stochastic processes may also play important roles in structuring these communities, and we propose a mechanism to explain overdominance in AM fungal communities. 5. Synthesis. This paper applies ecological models derived from studies on larger organisms to microbial communities. Results from this study suggest that a common log-normal SAD is likely to be observed across both microbial and macro taxa. However, due to the distinctive features of microbial biology, some noticeable differences, such as heavy overdominance, may lead to unique structures in microbial communities. This research not only highlights that, to a first approximation, microbial communities follow similar processes and have similar patterns to those of macroorganisms, but also the need for large-scale microbial data sets, if we are to understand the patterns and processes regulating global biodiversity.","2010",NA,"10.1111/j.1365-2745.2009.01622.x","WOS:000273950400017"

Neutral community models are derived from the proposition that basic probabilities of species loss (extinction, emigration) and gain (immigration, speciation) explain biological community structure, such that species with many individuals are very likely to be widespread. Niche models on the other hand assume that interactions between species and differential resource use mediate species coexistence, thus invoking environmental factors to explain community patterns. 2. In this study, we compared neutral and niche models to test how much of the spatial variability of assemblages of heterotrophic bacteria and phytoplankton in 13 lakes they could explain. Analysis of phytoplankton was restricted to cyanobacteria, so that they could be studied with the same molecular fingerprinting method, automated ribosomal intergenic spaces analysis (ARISA), as heterotrophic bacteria. We determined local biotic and abiotic lake variables as well as lake age, glacial history and distance between sites. 3. The neutral community model had a good fit to the community composition of heterotrophic bacteria (R-2 = 0.69), whereas it could not produce a significant model for the community composition of cyanobacteria. 4. The community composition of cyanobacteria was instead correlated to environmental variables. The best model, a combination of total organic carbon, biomass of eukaryotic phytoplankton, pH and conductivity, could explain 8% of the variation. In contrast, variation in the community composition of heterotrophic bacteria was not predicted by any of the environmental variables. Historical and spatial variables were not correlated to the community composition of either group. 5. The pattern found for heterotrophic bacteria suggests that stochastic processes are important. The correlation of cyanobacteria with local environmental variables alone is consistent with the niche model. We suggest that cyanobacteria, a group of organisms containing bloom-forming species, may be less likely to fit a neutral community model, since these blooms are usually triggered by a particular combination of environmental conditions.","2010",NA,"10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02473.x","WOS:000283725300002"

However, whether plant species coexistence could offset the impacts of heavy metal combined pollution on soil microbial community structure and soil enzymes activities is not well studied. The modified ecological dose model and PCR-RAPD method were used to assess the effects of two plant species coexistence on soil microbial community and enzymes activities subjected to Cd and Pb combined stress. The results indicated that monoculture and mixed culture would increased microbe populations under Cd and Pb combined stress, and the order of sensitivity of microbial community responding to heavy metal stress was: actinomycetes > bacteria > fungi. The respirations were significantly higher in planted soil than that in unplanted soil. The plant species coexistence could enhance soil enzyme activities under Cd and Pb combined. Furthermore, planted soil would be helpful to enhance soil genetic polymorphisms, but Cd and Pb pollution would cause a decrease on soil genetic polymorphisms.

Nevertheless, multiple nonindigenous fishes potentially threaten the persistence of native fishes, and little is known of the trophic ecology of either native or nonnative fishes in this system. Gut contents and stable isotopes (13C and 15N) were used to identify trophic relationships, trophic niche overlap and evaluate potential interactions among native and nonnative fishes. Both native and nonnative fishes fed across multiple trophic levels. In general, adult native suckers had lower 15N signatures and consumed more algae and detritus than smaller native fish, including juvenile suckers. Adult nonnative smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), yellow bullhead (Ameiurus natalis) and two species of trout preyed on small-bodied fishes and predaceous aquatic invertebrates leading to significantly higher trophic positions than small and large-bodied native fishes. Thus, the presence of these nonnative fishes extended community food-chain lengths by foraging at higher trophic levels. Although predation on juvenile native fishes might threaten persistence of native fishes, the high degree of omnivory suggests that impacts of nonnative predators may be lessened and dependent on environmental variability.","2010",NA,"10.1111/j.1600-0633.2010.00415.x","WOS:000277787300015"

However, variation in trade-offs is often determined at the molecular level, outside the scope of conventional ecological inquiry. In this study, we propose that understanding the intracellular basis for trade-offs in microbial systems can aid in predicting and interpreting patterns of diversity. First, we show how laboratory experiments and mathematical models have unveiled the hidden intracellular mechanisms underlying trade-offs key to microbial diversity: (i) metabolic and regulatory trade-offs in bacteria and yeast; (ii) life-history trade-offs in bacterial viruses. Next, we examine recent studies of marine microbes that have taken steps toward reconciling the molecular and the ecological views of trade-offs, despite the challenges in doing so in natural settings. Finally, we suggest avenues for research where mathematical modelling, experiments and studies of natural microbial communities provide a unique opportunity to integrate studies of diversity across multiple scales.","2010",NA,"10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01507.x","WOS:000281134800001"

Because seed size trades off with seed number, small-seeded species clearly have the advantage in fecundity, but what is the countervailing advantage of large seeds? Higher competitive ability combined with strong competitive asymmetry can in theory allow coexistence through a competition-colonization trade-off, but empirical evidence is inconsistent with this mechanism. Instead, the key advantage of large seeds appears to be their tolerance of stresses such as shade or drought that are present in some but not all regeneration sites. Here I present a simple, analytically tractable model of species coexistence in heterogeneous habitats through a tolerance-fecundity trade-off. Under this mechanism, the more tolerant species win all of the more stressful regeneration sites and some of those that are less stressful, whereas the more fecund species win most but not all of the less stressful sites. The tolerance-fecundity trade-off enables stable coexistence of large numbers of species in models with and without seed limitation. The tolerance-fecundity mechanism provides an excellent explanation for the maintenance of diversity of seed size within plant communities and also suggests new hypotheses for coexistence in animal and microbial communities.","2010",NA,"10.1073/pnas.0911637107","WOS:000275131100054"

Species differences in susceptibility to pathogens acting at early life history stages may strongly influence the abundance and distribution of tropical trees. Here, we test the susceptibility of 10 congeners of the pioneer genus Cecropia to fungal seed and seedling pathogens and compare interspecific differences in intrinsic seed defences with survival. 2. Pathogens were experimentally removed through fungicide addition and/or autoclave sterilization of forest soil to determine the relative importance of fungal versus other microbial pathogens. Treatments were applied during a 4-month seed incubation (pre-emergence) phase or during an 8-week germination phase to distinguish between seed and seedling mortality. 3. Overall, seedling emergence after incubation in fungicide-treated, autoclaved soil was twice that in live soil, with significant positive effects of fungicide for six of 10 species. Pathogen infection occurred while seeds were quiescent in soil; fungicide addition during germination had no effect on emergence. Seedling emergence after burial ranged from 6 to 58%, indicating large interspecific variation in the capacity for Cecropia seeds to persist in the seed bank. Neither interspecific variation in survivorship, nor the relative strength of fungicide effects on survivorship was correlated with seed defence traits. 4. For four species, measurements of fungicide effects on emergence were coupled with direct measurements of the fungal and bacterial infection of seeds and seedlings. For two species, fungicide addition resulted in lower fungal infection rates and higher emergence success. However, Cecropia peltata, the species with the highest overall emergence success, also had the highest fungal infection rate. This suggests that either C. peltata was infected by a different suite of fungi than other congeners, or that fungi had low pathogenicity when colonizing this host species. 5. Synthesis. Our study shows strong interspecific variation in seed survival and susceptibility to fungal infection among congeneric tree species with similar life history. These differences are likely to influence recruitment success from the soil seed bank and may play a role in species coexistence.","2010",NA,"10.1111/j.1365-2745.2009.01589.x","WOS:000272657400016"

The value of Simpson's index (D) is 0.09, which represented high diversity. Isolated bacteria were inoculated in micro titer plates and Niche overlap index (NOI) was calculated after two days of inoculation. The results of study indicate that direct incubation of samples in micro titer plates produces patterns of metabolic response useful in the classification and characterization of microbial communities. Principal component analysis of colour responses quantified from digitized images of plates revealed distinctive patterns among microbial habitats and spatial gradients within soil and compost sites. Correlation of the original carbon source variables to the principal components gives a functional basis to distinctions among communities.

The role of carbon and nitrogen nutrition in interactions between the pathogen and the antagonists Fusarium equiseti, Fusarium nygamai, Trichoderma harzianum and the non-antagonistic straw fungus Alternaria infectoria was investigated. Sole carbon source utilization patterns on Biolog plates were similar among the three Fusarium species, suggesting a possible role for competition. However, carbon niche overlap was unlikely to be important in antagonism by T. harzianum. Straw medium supplemented with sugars generally reduced the inhibitory effect of antagonists on growth of F. pseudograminearum in dual culture, indicating that availability of simple carbon sources does not limit antagonism. Adding nitrogen as urea, nitrate or ammonium to straw medium had little effect on antagonism by F. equiseti and F. nygamai, but ammonium addition removed the inhibitory effect of T. harzianum on growth of F. pseudograminearum. Displacement of F. pseudograminearum from straw by all fungi in a Petri dish assay was greater when urea or nitrate was used as a nitrogen source than with ammonium. All forms of nitrogen significantly increased displacement of F. pseudograminearum from straw under simulated field conditions when straws were either inoculated with T. harzianum or exposed to resident soil microbes. However, in 2 out of 3 experiments urea and nitrate were more effective than ammonium. The results suggest that availability of nitrogen, but not carbon, is limiting the activities of antagonists of F. pseudograminearum in straw, and the way nitrogen is applied can influence the rate of displacement and mortality of the pathogen in host residues.

"Chan, KS; Kosoy, M","Analysis of multi-strain Bartonella pathogens in natural host population - Do they behave as species or minor genetic variants?","EPIDEMICS","Modern advances in genetic analysis have made it feasible to ascertain the variant type of a pathogen infecting a host. Classification of pathogen variants is commonly performed by clustering analysis of the observed genetic divergence among the variants. A natural question arises whether the genetically distinct variants are epidemiologically distinct. A broader question is whether the different variants constitute separate microbial species or represent minor variations of the same species. These important issues were addressed in the context of analyzing dynamics of genetically distinct variants of Bartonella bacteria in cotton rat hosts. Frequencies of acquiring a new variant were measured in relation to the genetic differences between variants successively infecting an individual rodent host. Two statistical techniques were introduced for performing such analysis, and the methodologies were illustrated with a set of data collected from a particular multi-strain Bartonella system. We carried out a frequency analysis of co-infection patterns, and a Markov chain analysis of panels of successive mixed infection time series for testing some particular gene-based grouping of the Bartonella variants with a panel of observed disease data from a rodent population. Our analysis suggests that the three genogroups A, B and C of Bartonella function as independent species but the variants within each genogroup enjoy some cross-immunity against each other. The newly developed methodologies are broadly applicable for analyzing other multi-strain pathogen data which are increasingly collected for diverse infectious diseases. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

Most of our knowledge of resprouting strategies comes from fire-prone systems, but this cannot be readily applied to other systems where disturbances are less intense. In this study we evaluated sapling responses to stem snapping for 49 moist-forest species and 36 dry-forest species from two Bolivian tropical forests. To this end we compared in a field experiment the survival and height growth of clipped and control saplings for a two-year period, and related this to the shade tolerance, carbohydrate reserves, and the morphological traits (wood density, leaf size) of the species. Nearly all saplings resprouted readily after stem damage, although dry-forest species realized, on average, a better survival and growth after stem damage compared to moist-forest species. Shade-tolerant species were better at resprouting than light-demanding species in moist forest. This resprouting ability is an important prerequisite for successful regeneration in the shaded understory, where saplings frequently suffer damage from falling debris. Survival after stem damage was, surprisingly, only modestly related to stem reserves, and much more strongly related to wood density, possibly because a high wood density enables plants to resist fungi and pathogens and to reduce stem decay. Correlations between sapling performance and functional traits were similar for the two forest types, and for phylogenetically independent contrasts and for cross-species analyses. The consistency of these results suggests that tropical forest species face similar trade-offs in different sites and converge on similar sets of solutions. A high resprouting ability, as well as investments in stem defense and storage reserves, form part of a suite of co-evolved traits that underlies the growth-survival trade-off, and contributes to light gradient partitioning and species coexistence. These links with shade tolerance are important in the moist evergreen forest, which casts a deep, more persistent shade, but tend to diminish in dry deciduous forest where light is a less limiting resource.","2010",NA,"10.1890/09-0862.1","WOS:000281698400018"

It suggests that specialized natural enemies decrease offspring survival at high densities beneath parents, giving locally rarer species an advantage. This mechanism, in its original form, assumes that density dependence is overcompensating: mortality must be disproportionately high at the highest densities, with few offspring recruiting below their parents. We tested this assumption using parallel shadehouse and field density-series experiments on seedlings of a tropical tree, Pleradenophora longicuspis. We found strong, overcompensating mortality driven by fungal pathogens, causing 90% (shadehouse) or 100% (field) mortality within 4 weeks of germination, and generating a negative relationship between initial and final seedling densities. Fungicide treatment led to much lower, density-independent, mortality. Overcompensating mortality was extremely rapid, and could be missed without detailed monitoring. Such dynamics may prevent dead trees from being replaced by conspecifics, promoting coexistence as envisioned by the Janzen-Connell hypothesis.","2010",NA,"10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01520.x","WOS:000281895000007"

The Janzen-Connell (J-C) Model proposes that host-specific enemies maintain high tree species diversity by reducing seedling performance near conspecific adults and promoting replacement by heterospecific seedlings. Support for this model often comes from decreased performance for a species at near versus far distances from conspecific adults. However, the relative success of conspecific versus heterospecific seedlings recruiting under a given tree species is a critical, but untested, component of the J-C Model. 2. In a shade-house experiment, we tested plant-soil feedbacks as a J-C mechanism in six tropical tree species. We assessed effects of conspecific versus heterospecific cultured soil extracts on seedling performance for each species, and we compared performance of conspecific versus heterospecific seedlings grown with soil extract cultured by a particular tree species. Additionally, we tested whether soil microbes were creating these plant-soil feedbacks and whether low light increased species vulnerability to pathogens. 3. Among 30 potential comparisons of survival and mass for seedlings grown in conspecific versus heterospecific soil extracts, survival decreased in seven and increased in two, whereas mass decreased in 13 and increased in 1. To integrate survival and growth, we also examined seedling performance [(mean total mass x mean survival time)/(days of experiment)], which was lower in 16 and higher in 2 of 30 comparisons between seedlings grown with soil extract cultured by conspecific versus heterospecific individuals. Based on performance within a soil extract, conspecific seedlings were disadvantaged in 15 and favoured in 7 of 30 cases relative to heterospecific seedlings. 4. Species pairwise interactions of soil modification and seedling performance occurred regardless of sterilization, suggesting chemical mediation. Microbes lacked host-specificity and reduced performance regardless of extract source and irradiance. 5. Synthesis. These results, along with parallel research in temperate forests, suggest that plant-soil feedbacks are an important component of seedling dynamics in both ecosystems. However, negative conspecific feedbacks were more prevalent in tropical than temperate species. Thus, negative plant-soil feedbacks appear to facilitate species coexistence via negative distance-dependent processes in tropical but not temperate forests, but the feedbacks were mediated through chemical effects rather than through natural enemies as expected under the J-C Model.","2010",NA,"10.1111/j.1365-2745.2009.01619.x","WOS:000273950400015"

One group of models predicts that if hosts are infected with more than one strain or species of parasite, then competition between the parasites will select for higher virulence. While this idea makes intuitive sense, empirical data to support it are rare and equivocal. We investigated the relationship between fitness and virulence during both inter- and intraspecific competition for a fungal parasite of insects, Metarhizium anisopliae. Contrary to theoretical expectations, competition favored parasite strains with either a lower or a higher virulence depending on the competitor: when in interspecific competition with an entomopathogenic nematode, Steinernema feltiae, less virulent strains of the fungus were more successful, but when competing against conspecific fungi, more virulent strains were better competitors. We suggest that the nature of competition (direct via toxin production when competing against the nematode, indirect via exploitation of the host when competing against conspecific fungal strains) determines the relationship between virulence and competitive ability.","2010",NA,"10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.00999.x","WOS:000281636400012"

Insect species richness increased and then declined with increase in the total insect biomass reared from a sporocarp, suggesting the potential importance of interspecific competition. Successional niche partitioning explained the spatial distribution of the four specialist species. The aggregation model of coexistence satisfactorily explained the stable coexistence of the species. The specialist species displayed higher population persistence than the generalists. Simulation studies suggest that restricted movements of adults could override patch-level larval aggregation. The effect of such restricted movements on stabilizing coexistence in fungus-insect communities has not been previously appreciated.

Nevertheless, it is still unclear whether competition remains as an important structuring force in habitats strongly influenced by disturbance. The conventional belief remains that the importance of competition decreases with increasing disturbance, but limited theory suggests otherwise. Using protist communities established in laboratory microcosms, we demonstrate that disturbance does not diminish the importance of competition. Interspecific competition significantly increased rates of species extinction over a broad disturbance gradient, and increasing disturbance intensities increased, rather than decreased, the tempo of competitive exclusion. This community-level pattern is linked to the species-level pattern that interspecific competition led to most frequent extinctions of each species at the highest level of disturbance that the species can tolerate. Consequently, despite a strong tradeoff between competitive ability and disturbance tolerance across the competing species, species diversity generally declined with disturbance. The consistent structuring role of competition throughout the disturbance gradient underscores the need to understand competitive interactions and their consequences even in highly disturbed habitats.","2010",NA,"10.1073/pnas.1000699107","WOS:000280144500041"

Recently it has been recorded from Ireland, the Channel Islands and north-west France. On mainland Britain, an establishment phase spanning an estimated maximum of 45 years was followed by biphasic range expansion comprising a slow start of 1.6 km year(-1) between 1910 and 1930, followed by 40 years of approximately linear spread of 13 km year(-1). Northwards expansion now appears to be limited by sub-zero winter temperatures and is no longer apparent. Comparison with historic records of native ciids shows that this range expansion is genuine, rather than an artefact of recording effort or bias. It has no doubt been facilitated by C. bilamellatus' ability to exploit a wide range of sometimes under-used fungal resources, by its favourable rate of increase, by its tolerance of both wet and dry conditions, and by a low rate of parasitoid attack. Although there is the potential for direct and indirect interaction between C. bilamellatus, native ciids and their shared parasitoids, the current ecological impact of C. bilamellatus appears to be low. It seems likely that C. bilamellatus will spread through Europe, limited primarily by resource availability and low winter temperatures.","2010",NA,"10.1007/s10530-009-9455-y","WOS:000274614800011"
"Miki, T; Ushio, M; Fukui, S; Kondoh, M","Functional diversity of microbial decomposers facilitates plant coexistence in a plant-microbe-soil feedback model","PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA","Theory and empirical evidence suggest that plant-soil feedback (PSF) determines the structure of a plant community and nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. The plant community alters the nutrient pool size in soil by affecting litter decomposition processes, which in turn shapes the plant community, forming a PSF system. However, the role of microbial decomposers in PSF function is often overlooked, and it remains unclear whether decomposers reinforce or weaken litter-mediated plant control over nutrient cycling. Here, we present a theoretical model incorporating the functional diversity of both plants and microbial decomposers. Two fundamental microbial processes are included that control nutrient mineralization from plant litter: (i) assimilation of mineralized nutrient into the microbial biomass (microbial immobilization), and (ii) release of the microbial nutrients into the inorganic nutrient pool (net mineralization). With this model, we show that microbial diversity may act as a buffer that weakens plant control over the soil nutrient pool, reversing the sign of PSF from positive to negative and facilitating plant coexistence. This is explained by the decoupling of litter decomposability and nutrient pool size arising from a flexible change in the microbial community composition and decomposition processes in response to variations in plant litter decomposability. Our results suggest that the microbial community plays a central role in PSF function and the plant community structure. Furthermore, the results strongly imply that the plant-centered view of nutrient cycling should be changed to a plant-microbe-soil feedback system, by incorporating the community ecology of microbial decomposers and their functional diversity.","2010",NA,"10.1073/pnas.0914281107","WOS:000280767700051"

Conspecific extract reduced Acer saccharum mass in low light but increased it in high light. To integrate survival and growth, we examined seedling performance [(mean total mass x mean survival time)/(days of experiment)] at low and high light. In conspecific versus heterospecific soil extract, seedling performance was lower in two, higher in four and neutral in 18 of 24 cases, suggesting no advantage to dispersing away from conspecifics.

"Fox, JW; Nelson, WA; McCauley, E","Coexistence mechanisms and the paradox of the plankton: quantifying selection from noisy data","ECOLOGY","Many species of phytoplankton typically co-occur within a single lake, as do many zooplankton species (the paradox of the plankton''). Long-term co-occurrence suggests stable coexistence. Coexistence requires that species be equally fit'' on average. Coexistence mechanisms can equalize species' long-term average fitnesses by reducing fitness differences to low levels at all times, and by causing species' relative fitness to fluctuate over time, thereby reducing differences in time-averaged fitness. We use recently developed time series analysis techniques drawn from population genetics to estimate the strength of net selection (time-averaged selection over a year) and fluctuating selection (an index of the variation in selection throughout the year) in natural plankton communities. Analysis of 99 annual time series of zooplankton species dynamics and 49 algal time series reveals that within-year net selection generally is statistically significant but ecologically weak. Rates of net selection are; 10 times faster in laboratory competition experiments than in nature, indicating that natural coexistence mechanisms are strong. Most species experience significant fluctuating selection, indicating that fluctuation-dependent mechanisms may contribute to coexistence. Within-year net selection increases with enrichment, implying that among-year coexistence mechanisms such as trade-offs between competitive ability and resting egg production are especially important at high enrichment. Fluctuating selection also increases with enrichment but is independent of the temporal variance of key abiotic factors, suggesting that fluctuating selection does not emerge solely from variation in abiotic conditions, as hypothesized by Hutchinson. Nor does fluctuating selection vary among lake-years because more variable abiotic conditions comprise stronger perturbations to which species exhibit frequency-dependent responses, since models of this mechanism fail to reproduce observed patterns of fluctuating selection. Instead, fluctuating selection may arise from internally generated fluctuations in relative fitness, as predicted by models of fluctuation-dependent coexistence mechanisms.

Empirical support for this insight comes from experiments using mutant strains, termed 'cheats', which exploit the cooperative behaviour of wild-type strains. However, little detailed work has gone into characterising the competitive dynamics of cooperative and cheating strains. We test three specific predictions about the fitness consequences of cheating to different extents by examining the production of the iron-scavenging siderophore molecule, pyoverdin, in the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We create a collection of mutants that differ in the amount of pyoverdin that they produce (from 1% to 96% of the production of paired wild types) and demonstrate that these production levels correlate with both gene activity and the ability to bind iron. Across these mutants, we found that (1) when grown in a mixed culture with a cooperative wild-type strain, the relative fitness of a mutant is negatively correlated with the amount of pyoverdin that it produces; (2) the absolute and relative fitness of the wild-type strain in the mixed culture is positively correlated with the amount of pyoverdin that the mutant produces; and (3) when grown in a monoculture, the absolute fitness of the mutant is positively correlated with the amount of pyoverdin that it produces. Overall, we demonstrate that cooperative pyoverdin production is exploitable and illustrate how variation in a social behaviour determines fitness differently, depending on the social environment.","2010",NA,"10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.01939.x","WOS:000275761400010"

These differences in adaptability suggest differences in either the rate at which beneficial mutations are produced, the effects of beneficial mutations, or both. We tested these possibilities by subjecting four populations (two controls and two mutants with lower adaptabilities) to multiple replicas of a regimen of positive selection and then determining the fitnesses of the progeny through time and the changes in the consensus, full-length sequences of 56 genomes. We observed that at a given number of passages, the overall fitness gains observed for control populations were larger than fitness gains in mutant populations. However, these changes did not correlate with differences in the numbers of mutations accumulated in the two types of genomes. This result is consistent with beneficial mutations having a lower beneficial effect on mutant strains. Despite the overall fitness differences, some replicas of one mutant strain at passage 50 showed fitness increases similar to those observed for the wild type. We hypothesized that these evolved, high-fitness mutants may have a lower robustness than evolved, high-fitness controls. Robustness is the ability of a virus to avoid phenotypic changes in the face of mutation. We confirmed our hypothesis in mutation-accumulation experiments that showed a normalized fitness loss that was significantly larger in mutant bottlenecked populations than in control populations.","2010",NA,"10.1128/JVI.00710-09","WOS:000277318600009"

Plant diversity has profound effects on primary production. Plant diversity has been shown to correlate with increased primary production in nutrient-limited grassland ecosystems. This overyielding has been attributed to vertical niche differentiation among species below-ground, allowing for complementarity in resource capture. However, a rigorous test of this longstanding hypothesis is lacking because roots of different species could not be distinguished in diverse communities. 2. Here, we present the first application of a DNA-based technique that quantifies species abundances in multispecies root samples. We were thus able to compare root distributions in monocultures of two grasses and two forbs with root distributions in four-species mixtures. In order to investigate if vertical niche differentiation is driven by soil nutrient depletion, the topsoil layer of the communities were either nutrient-rich or -poor. 3. Immediately in the first year, 40% more root biomass was produced in mixtures than expected from the monocultures, together with significant below-ground complementarity effects, probably preceding above-ground overyielding. This below-ground overyielding appeared not to be the result of vertical niche differentiation, as rooting depth of the community tended to decrease, rather than increase in mixtures compared to monocultures. Roots thus tended to clump in the very dense topsoil layer rather than segregate over the whole profile in mixtures. The below-ground overyielding was mainly driven by enhanced root investments of one species, Anthoxanthum odoratum, in the densely rooted topsoil layer without retarding the growth of the other species. 4. Synthesis. Conventional ecological mechanisms, such as competition for nutrients, do not seem to be able to explain the increased root investments of A. odoratum in mixtures compared to monocultures, with apparently little effect on the root growth of the other species. Instead, the observed root responses are consistent with species-specific root recognition responses. From a community perspective, the observed early below-ground overyielding may initiate the recently reported increased soil organic matter, mineralization and N availability and thus may ultimately be responsible for the higher productivity at high plant species diversity.","2010",NA,"10.1111/j.1365-2745.2010.01702.x","WOS:000280667200014"

The evolutionary history and ecological role of fungal toxins, however, remain largely unexplored pending the organization of structured investigations. The fruitbodies of fungi are structures for sexual reproduction that form unique epigeal stages facilitating interactions with mobile terrestrial organisms living above the ground. In terms of fungal fitness such interactions can be neutral, negative or positive. Many invertebrates and vertebrates are known to feed on mushrooms and toadstools. So far, most available natural history studies of fungivorous invertebrates are on those that inhabit in fungi for their developing stage and as such can be specifically recognized. On the other hand, fewer cases of vertebrates have been reported since they do not live in the fruitbodies and it is hard to discriminate predators. The influence of predation on fungal fitness can be variable given the combination of fungal and animal characteristics and timing. The most critical predation in terms of fungal fitness is the one occurring on the initial immature and mature stages of fungi. It is well known that many of the secondary metabolites present in mushrooms are harmful or toxic to animals in general, though little specific information is available. We planed investigate further the different aspects of animal interactions with mushrooms using the genus Amanita to clarify the relevance of mushroom poisons. However, we recognized that the paucity of information of mobile fungal consumers on fungi those can be the most important consumers affecting on fungal host fitness. Different procedure are needed to trace spore feeding insects and mature fruitbodies eating animals since they are not breeding in fruitbodies but they can be the most important predators in terms of fungal host fitness. But this kind of information is scarce in worldwide. To clarify the ecological significance of fungal secondary metabolites we suggest focusing on fungal consumption by mobile animals in the functional stages of macrosporocarps.","2010",NA,NA,"WOS:000278709400010"

With advances in molecular identification and other research techniques, however, there has been growing interest among mycologists and ecologists in understanding how different ecological factors affect EMF community structure and diversity. While factors such as soil chemistry and host specificity have long been considered important, an increasing number of laboratory and field studies have documented that interspecific competition also has a major impact on EMF species interactions and may significantly influence EMF community structure. In this review, I examine the progress that has been made in understanding the nature of EMF competition. Currently, there are four conclusions that can be drawn: negative competitive effects are rarely reciprocal; competitive outcomes are environmentally context-dependent; field distributions often reflect competitive interactions; and timing of colonization influences competitive success. In addition, I highlight recent studies documenting links between competitive coexistence and EMF community structure, including checkerboard distributions, lottery models, storage effects, and colonization-competition tradeoffs. Finally, I discuss several aspects of EMF competition needing further investigation and some newer methods with which to address them.","2010",NA,"10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03399.x","WOS:000280998600007"

Two main theories explaining these processes have emerged; niche theory, which highlights the importance of deterministic processes, and neutral theory, which focuses on stochastic processes. We examined whether neutral or niche-based mechanisms best explain the composition and structure of communities of a functionally important soil microbe, the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Using molecular techniques, we surveyed AM fungi from 425 individual plants of 28 plant species along a soil pH gradient. There was evidence that both niche and neutral processes structured this community. Species abundances fitted the zero-sum multinomial distribution and there was evidence of dispersal limitation, both indicators of neutral processes. However, we found stronger support that niche differentiation based on abiotic soil factors, primarily pH, was structuring the AM fungal community. Host plant species affected AM fungal community composition negligibly compared to soil pH. We conclude that although niche partitioning was the primary mechanism regulating the composition and diversity of natural AM fungal communities, these communities are also influenced by stochastic-neutral processes. This study represents one of the most comprehensive investigations of community-level processes acting on soil microbes; revealing a community that although influenced by stochastic processes, still responded in a predictable manner to a major abiotic niche axis, soil pH. The strong response to environmental factors of this community highlights the susceptibility of soil microbes to environmental change.

Different food and feeding situations were created by using only pond water or pond water plus pond bottom sediment or pond water plus pond bottom sediment and artificial feeding. All tanks were fertilized twice, prior to stocking and 2 weeks later after starting the experiment to stimulate natural food production. Common carp preferred artificial feed over benthic macroinvertebrates, followed by zooplankton. Common carp did not prefer any group of phytoplankton in any treatment. Common carp was mainly benthic in habitat choice, feeding on benthic macroinvertebrates when only plankton and benthic macroinvertebrates were available in the system. In the absence of benthic macroinvertebrates, their feeding niche shifted from near the bottom of the tanks to the water column where they spent 85% of the total time and fed principally on zooplankton. Common carp readily switched to artificial feed when available, which led to better growth. Common carp preferred to graze individually. Behavioral observations of common carp in tanks yielded new information that assists our understanding of their ecological niche.

Evidence of evolutionary divergence of populations was provided by three complementary analyses. First, analysis of molecular variance rejected the null hypothesis that genetic diversity within each sampling site was not significantly different than that of all sites pooled together (P<0.0001). Second, UniFrac and Parsimony tests showed phylogenetic clustering of sampling sites was highly significant (P<0.001). Third, pairwise F(ST) statistics showed significant evolutionary divergence of populations based on the location in the estuary. To test the hypothesis that environmental niche-driven evolutionary divergence can create and maintain microbial biogeography, we used both statistical inference and an experimental manipulation to assess the independent effects of environment and geography. Significant effects of each on genotype distributions and population divergence supported the hypothesis. Our data are consistent with both sympatric and parapatric models of speciation, and suggest niche partitioning can contribute to evolutionary divergence and observable biogeographic patterns in microbial communities even among closely related taxa at limited spatial scales without significant barriers to dispersal.

Testate amoeba diversity was correlated to that of mosses but not of vascular plants. Diversity peaked in rich fen for testate amoebae and in extremely rich fen for mosses, while for testate amoebae and mosses it was lowest in bog but for vascular plants in extremely rich fen.

Abiotic variables explained a higher percentage of the species data for testate amoebae (30.3% or 19.5% for binary data) than for mosses (13.4%) and vascular plants (10%). These results show that (1) vascular plant, moss and testate amoeba communities respond differently to ecological gradients in peatlands and (2) testate amoebae are more strongly related than vascular plants to the abiotic factors at the mire surface.

To determine the most appropriate conditions for red-listed gasteromycete fungi in such grasslands, we investigated their pH preferences in this habitat in southern Sweden. During two winters soil samples were collected from the vicinity of mycelia of these species. Chemical analysis revealed that none of the fungi occurred in sandy habitats with a pH lower than 5, although pH values between 4 and 5 are very common in sandy grasslands in the area. We found niche differentiation within the genus Tulostoma in that two out of four species occurred mainly in soils with high lime content, while one had a broad niche and one occurred mainly in soils low in lime and with a pH below 7.5. Also in the genus Geastrum, some species occurred at high lime content, while most Geastrum as well as two Disciseda species preferred soils with only low amounts of lime. We conclude that many species prefer areas with neutral to slightly acid soil. The results were compared with data for key plant species collected in a previous study of calcareous sandy grasslands and this showed that these in general had a wider pH range than the studied fungi. The results highlight the importance of varying pH levels in protected areas and that the transition zone between lime-containing topsoil and complete decalcification is a preferred environment for many red-listed fungi as well as plants.

The primary tenets of the RPDH are that (i) in plant communities, the intensity of inter-specific competition can depend upon the degree to which niche differentiation and resource partitioning occur among species, (ii) agricultural systems are unique in that management practices, such as crop rotation, source of fertility and weed management, result in inputs to the soil and (iii) these inputs directly or indirectly become soil resource pools from which crops and weeds may partition resources. The RPDH leads to the novel prediction that along a gradient of increasing cropping system diversity, yield loss due to weed-crop competition (i.e. the impact on yield per unit weed density) for soil resources should decrease. Similarly, the degree to which crops and weeds overlap in soil resource niche breadth (which is determined by species-specific functional traits for resource acquisition), will determine the extent to which weed-crop competition weakens as resource pool diversity increases. While there have been no direct tests of the RPDH, we highlight evidence from the agricultural literature that provides strong support for components of the hypothesis. Validation of the RPDH would have important implications across a broad range of cropping systems for the development of management strategies that aim to reduce yield loss impact per unit weed plant density and the fundamental principles of integrated weed management, such as the concepts of weed thresholds and critical periods.","2010",NA,"10.1111/j.1365-3180.2009.00745.x","WOS:000273478700004"

Effects of changes in soil organic matter and nutrient content on the AOB and AOA are poorly understood. Our aim was to compare effects of long-term soil organic matter depletion and amendments with labile (straw) and more recalcitrant (peat) organic matter, with and without easily plant-available nitrogen, on the activities, abundances and community structures of AOB and AOA. Soil was sampled from a long-term field site in Sweden that was established in 1956. The potential ammonia oxidation rates, the AOB and AOA amoA gene abundances and the community structures of both groups based on T-RFLP of amoA genes were determined. Straw amendment during 50 years had not altered any of the measured soil parameters, while the addition of peat resulted in a significant increase of soil organic carbon as well as a decrease in pH. Nitrogen fertilization alone resulted in a small decrease in soil pH, organic carbon and total nitrogen, but an increase in primary production. Type and amount of organic matter had an impact on the AOB and AOA community structures and the AOA abundance. Our findings confirmed that AOA are abundant in soil, but showed that under certain conditions the AOB dominate, suggesting niche differentiation between the two groups at the field site. The large differences in potential rates between treatments correlated to the AOA community size, indicating that they were functionally more important in the nitrification process than the AOB. The AOA abundance was positively related to addition of labile organic carbon, which supports the idea that AOA could have alternative growth strategies using organic carbon. The AOB community size varied little in contrast to that of the AOA. This indicates that the bacterial ammonia oxidizers as a group have a greater ecophysiological diversity and potentially cover a broader range of habitats. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

O. nova responds with population decreases, T. velatus and N. silvestris with small changes and C. sphagnetorum with population increases.

The population responses of these soil animals to inoculation of five species of EM fungi growing in symbiosis with their host tree (Pinus sylvestris L) and one saprotrophic fungus.

C. sphagnetorum did not increase in abundance in any of the treatments with EM fungi but increased its abundance four times in both FS and PV.

However, classical models assume resource specialization in the form of distinct niches, which does not obviously apply to the broadly overlapping resource use in plant communities. Here we utilize an experimental framework based on competition theory to test whether plants partition resources via classical niche differentiation or via plasticity in resource use. We explore two alternatives: niche preemption, in which individuals respond to a superior competitor by switching to an alternative, less-used resource, and dominant plasticity, in which superior competitors exhibit high resource use plasticity and shift resource use depending on the competitive environment. We determined competitive ability by measuring growth responses with and without neighbors over a growing season and then used N-15 tracer techniques to measure uptake of different nitrogen (N) forms in a field setting. We show that four alpine plant species of differing competitive abilities have statistically indistinguishable uptake patterns (nitrate > ammonium > glycine) in their fundamental niche (without competitors) but differ in whether they shift these uptake patterns in their realized niche (with competitors). Competitively superior species increased their uptake of the most available N form, ammonium, when in competition with the rarer, competitively inferior species. In contrast, the competitively inferior species did not alter its N uptake pattern in competition. The existence of plasticity in resource use among the dominant species provides a mechanism that helps to explain the manner by which plant species with broadly overlapping resource use might coexist.","2010",NA,"10.1890/09-1849.1","WOS:000284158600014"

A new way to study the almost unknown feeding habits of soil mesofauna e.g. oribatid mites is to use PCR-based techniques. When applying PCR on these small organisms, the low amount of ingested DNA can cause problems. Even more important is to certify that the amplified DNA does not originate from body-surface contamination. The aim of this study was to analyse if washing of the body surface combined with PCR can be a successful approach when identifying the food ingested by fungivorous mites. The method was developed in a laboratory system where we used the oribatid mite Archegozetes longisetosus as a model organism due to its relatively short life cycle and ease of laboratory culturing. The results demonstrated that surface contamination is a serious problem. Both washing and dissection was needed to remove surface contamination on such small organisms. To get a reliable result the samples also had to contain at least five pooled guts, but preferably ten. This is the first step towards a successful use of PCR-based methods to study natural feeding habits of species most likely contaminated on the body surface. When modified for field conditions, the results obtained by this method have a high potential to answer many questions about the animals feeding habits, and their functional role in the soil.

This research aims at assessing the effects of medium-term soil storage (6-9 months) at room temperature on air-dried soil samples from two Mediterranean forest locations for the measurement of various microbiological and biochemical properties (microbial biomass carbon, basal respiration, metabolic quotient, acid phosphatase activity, urease activiy, -glucosidase activity, and soluble carbon). Storage of air-dried soil samples for 6 months had no significant effects on the studied properties in any location. With regard to samples stored for 9 months, we only found differences at the location with higher mean rainfall in the values of basal respiration, the metabolic quotient and -glucosidase, and urease activities. Our results show that biochemical properties from Mediterranean semi-arid soils, are medium-term stable in stored air-dried soil samples. Thus, these findings would encourage the selection of biochemical properties on a practical basis, as there is no strict requirement to determine these properties immediately after sampling, as they remain valid for several months.","2009",NA,"10.1080/15324980903038727","WOS:000267835600003"

The mortality rate was significantly lower for irradiated clams compared with the control. In the same way, ammonia content was lower for irradiated clams (especially 1 kGy irradiated group). Considerable levels of total mesophiles, coliforms, staphylococcus, faecal streptococcus and Escherichia coli were detected in the control and irradiation had immediately reduced these charges; all bacteria studied experienced a 1- to 3-log reduction following 1 kGy irradiation. At the last day of storage, irradiated groups showed a noticeable reduction in the bacterial counts, whereas the mesophiles, staphylococcus and coliform germs were abundant in the control group (6.3, 2 and 1.7 log CFU g(-1), respectively). Irradiation doses up to 1 kGy had not an immediate effect on fatty acids composition (P > 0.05) and lipid profile was better in irradiated samples, where polyunsaturated fatty acid fraction was maintained throughout storage using irradiation. Also, sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed minor changes in proteins bands between different samples. These results demonstrated that 1 kGy irradiation appeared to be the optimum dose for treating alive clams (R. decussatus), through improving the microbial quality and alleviating biochemical changes during refrigerated storage.","2009",NA,"10.1111/j.1365-2621.2009.01952.x","WOS:000265708800020"
"Pogacean, MO; Gavrilescu, M","PLANT PROTECTION PRODUCTS AND THEIR SUSTAINABLE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY USE","ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL","Protection of plants from diseases, pests and weeds plays a decisive role in agricultural development, as an essential part in planning and policy of numerous countries. Since the plant protection products are mainly chemicals and may be not only poisonous for humans and fauna, but they may also pollute water bodies, ground water and soil with hazardous pollutants, their use have to be environmentally friendly and sustainable. The paper discuss some aspects of benefits and risks concerning the use of pesticides as an important tool for plant protection agents, reductions and limitations of uses devoted to the improvement of the residue in plants and food and the environmental quality. It is showed that, although a long-lasting residue may be desirable in some situations because the pesticide is effective for a longer period of time, long-lasting residues are not always desirable. Pesticides are presented as grouped mainly according to their mode of action or the way a pesticide destroys or controls the target pest (herbicides, fungicides, insecticides), and their characteristics, targets, structure and categories are presented, along with their formulation into many usable products for satisfactory storage, effective application, safety of the user and the environment. Existing policies and legislation on pesticides are briefly outlined. In addition, considering the environmental side effects of traditional pesticides, some aspects on the impacts and risks to the environment, human health, non-target organisms in relation with the use of these compounds are highlighted. Several indicators of sustainable use of pesticides are analyzed in terms of the beneficial effect of the product, and also considering monitoring and pollution prevention.","2009",NA,NA,"WOS:000267917400035"

The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate filter/real-time qPCR to quickly and accurately determine and quantify the airborne influenza and avian influenza virus. In this study, the sampling stress of filtration to influenza virus and the storage effects for both the virus and extracted RNA were evaluated in the laboratory. Then, the collection efficiencies of open-face and closed-face filter cassettes were compared in a wet poultry market. From July 8 to August 19, 2006, a total of 36 air samples were quantified by filter/real-time qPCR. The recovery rate of the virus on a filter stored at 4C reached 0.94 after 3-day storage, whereas the RNA stored at -80C was 100% after 3-month storage. In terms of collection efficiency, the closed-face filter cassette was superior to the open-face filter cassette in the field study. In the wet poultry market, it was revealed that both the positive rate and concentration of influenza A virus in the chicken pen were higher than that in the duck pen, possibly due to differences in ventilation type, climate factors, and avian characteristics. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the quantification of airborne influenza virus in field samples.

Recent evidence suggests that both partner choice and sanctioning may play roles in preventing the invasion of less-beneficial rhizobia in legume-rhizobium mutualisms. The importance of these mechanisms in natural communities, however, remains unclear. We grew 12 Medicago truncatula maternal families with a mixture of three rhizobium strains from their native range for three plant generations and estimated the symbiotic benefits (nodule number and size) conferred to each rhizobium strain. In this experiment, the majority of M. truncatula genotypes formed more nodules with more beneficial rhizobium strains, providing evidence for adaptive partner choice. We also found that three generations of symbiosis resulted in an increase in the relative frequency of rhizobium strains that were most beneficial to plants-suggesting that partner choice affects rhizobium fitness. By contrast, we found no evidence that plants differentially rewarded rhizobia postnodulation via sanctioning leading to differences in nodule size. Taken together, our data suggest that plants have evolved to recognize beneficial rhizobial signals during the early stages of symbiosis, and that signaling between plants and rhizobia may be subject to coevolutionary pressures.","2009",NA,"10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00582.x","WOS:000263679800007"
"Zagal, E; Muñoz, C; Quiroz, M; Córdova, C","Sensitivity of early indicators for evaluating quality changes in soil organic matter","GEODERMA","Labile soil carbon fractions and enzymatic activity are typically more sensitive to changes in soil management practices or environmental conditions than total soil organic matter, and consequently they are well-established as early indicators of change due to crop residue incorporation, soil use or pollution. However, less information has been reported for volcanic soils under different cropping systems where there are unique C stabilization mechanisms that promote faster accumulation of soil organic matter. The aim of our study was to compare the influence of three types of crop rotations (annual, arable crop and crop-pastures rotation) on total soil C and N as well as on several early indicators (mineralizable C and N, soil microbial biomass (C(mic)), particulate organic matter (POM) and dehydrogenase activity), using a long-established experiment in volcanic soil (medial, amorphic, thermic Humic Haploxerands) of the central valley of Chile. The results found that the sensitivity to management changes varied between treatments for microbial biomass C and N, mineralized C and N, and dehydrogenase activity, and that in general these responses were proportionately greater than those found for total C. However, differences in POM-C content were less consistent Our results confirm the value of these labile fractions and this enzyme as sensitive indicators for detecting changes in SOM in the short term both for annual arable crop and crop-pasture rotations. In conclusion, microbial biomass and dehydrogenase activity were the indicators most sensitive to changes in soil-crop management increasing in 1-2 times their sensitivity in comparison with other indicators. However, increases in microbial biomass C in all treatments were proportionally lower than increases in organic C that resulted in low values for the microbial quotient (C(mic) to C(org)) (although there were different between treatments) suggesting that the stabilizing mechanisms acting in volcanic soils can result in proportionally larger amounts of stabilized organic matter that are contained in the total organic C of the soil. POM was not an appropriate indicator of changes in soil organic matter (SOM) for this volcanic soil under distinct crop rotations. The inclusion of pastures (5 years of alfalfa or white clover) in the annual crop rotation promotes the increase of both total and labile fractions of soil organic matter in comparison with annual arable crop rotations, while the inclusion of short rotation pastures (2 years of red clover) had a minimum effect on biological parameters.

However, there is little experimental evidence for such partitioning, in particular, as assessed across a gradient of species richness. In experimental communities of one, three, and six temperate grassland species in the field, we tested whether increasing species richness (1) decreases niche breadths of individual species, (2) decreases niche overlap among species, and (3) increases niche breadth of whole communities. Six N sources consisting of three different chemical forms of N-15-labeled N ((NO3-)-N-15, (NH4+)-N-15, C-13(2)-N-15-glycine) injected at two soil depths (3 and 12 cm) were applied to each community. The chemical form and the soil depth of N characterize the niches for which niche breadth (Levins' B) and overlap (proportional similarity) were measured. After 48 hours, aboveground plant material was harvested to measure N-15 enrichment. As expected, niche breadth of single species and niche overlap among species decreased with increased species richness, but community niche breadth did not increase. The decrease in niche breadth and niche overlap mostly occurred among subordinate species or pairs of subordinate and dominant species, rather than among dominant species. Species in the six-species mixtures mostly preferred NO3- from shallow soil. This may be partly explained by the presence of legumes in all six-species mixtures which allowed N sparing (i.e., increased availability of soil N since legumes rely more on atmospheric N-2 than on soil N). Niche separation with respect to N uptake from different chemical forms and soil depths did not contribute much to facilitating the coexistence of dominant species, nor do our results suggest it as a major driver of positive diversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. However, partitioning of N may be important for the persistence of subordinate species.","2009",NA,"10.1890/08-0802.1","WOS:000269855400007"

Above this baseline, fixed spatial heterogeneity produced small but predictable increases in metacommunity diversity through species sorting, while heterogeneity and dispersal together altered local community structure (composition and relative abundance) through mass effects. 4.

Coexistence among epiphytic bacterial populations mediated through nutritional resource partitioning. Applied and Environmental Microbiology 60, 4468-4477.]. The ability to grow in these key CS in minimal media was studied for 120h in 12 h steps. The NO1 was calculated for inter-species (F verticillioides-A. flavus) and for intra-species (A. flavus-A. favus) using CS utilization patterns over the range of interacting environmental conditions. 30 C, over the whole aw range examined, was found to be optimal for utilization of the maximum number of CS by A. favus. In contrast, for F. verticillioides this was more so at 20 C; 25 C allowed a suboptimal usage of CS for both species. NOls confirmed the nutritional dominance of A. favus at 30 C, especially at lower a. levels and that of F. verticillioides at 20 degrees C, mainly at 0.95 a(w). In other conditions of a(w) based on CS utilization patterns, the data indicated that A. favus and F. verticillioides occupied different ecological niches. The variability in nutritional sources utilization between A. favus strains was not related to their ability to produce aflatoxins (AFs). This type of data helps to explain the nutritional dominance of fungal species and strains under different environmental conditions.

Structure of flows and their distribution within and between trophic levels were analysed by aggregating single flows into combined flows for discrete trophic levels. The trophic flows primarily occurred in the first four trophic level (TL) and the food web structure in this reservoir ecosystem was characterized by the dominance of low TL organisms, with the highest TL of only 3.57 for the top predator. Highest system omnivory index (SOI) was observed for indigenous catfishes (0.422), followed by the exotic fish Mozambique Tilapia (0.402). Nile Tilapia and Pearl spots show the highest niche overlap which suggests high competition for similar resources. The mixed trophic impact routine reveals that an increase in the abundance of the African catfish would negatively impact almost all fish groups such as Indian major carps, Pearl spots, indigenous catfishes and Tilapines. The other invasive fish Mozambique Tilapia adversely affects the indigenous catfishes. The most interesting observation in this study is that the most dominant invasive fish in this reservoir, the Nile Tilapia does not negatively impact any of the fish groups. In fact it positively impacts the Indian major carps. The direct and indirect effects of predation between system components (i.e. fish, invertebrates, phytoplankton and detritus) are quantitatively described and the possible influence and role in the ecosystem's functioning of the invasive fish species are discussed.

The diversity and ecophysiology of Rhodocyclales in activated sludge from a full-scale wastewater treatment plant were analyzed following a holistic strategy based on the isotope array approach, which allows for a parallel functional probing of different phylogenetic groups. Initial diagnostic microarray, comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence, and quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization surveys indicated the presence of a diverse community, consisting of an estimated number of 27 operational taxonomic units that grouped in at least seven main Rhodocyclales lineages. Substrate utilization profiles of probe-defined populations were determined by radioactive isotope array analysis and microautoradiography-fluorescence in situ hybridization of activated sludge samples that were briefly exposed to different substrates under oxic and anoxic, nitrate-reducing conditions. Most detected Rhodocyclales groups were actively involved in nitrogen transformation, but varied in their consumption of propionate, butyrate, or toluene, and thus in their ability to use different carbon sources in activated sludge. This indicates that the functional redundancy of nitrate reduction and the functional versatility of substrate usage are important factors governing niche overlap and differentiation of diverse Rhodocyclales members in this activated sludge.

More recently it has been suggested that plant population dynamics may be linked with the development of the below-ground community. The biologically active soil zone where root-root and root-microbe communications occur is named Rhizosphere where root exudates play active roles in regulating rhizosphere interactions. Root exudation can regulate the soil microbial community, withstand herbivory, facilitate beneficial symbioses, modify the chemical and physical soil properties and inhibit the growth of competing plant species. In this review, we explore the current knowledge assessing the importance of root exudates in plant interactions, in communications between parasitic plants and their hosts and how some soil microbial components could regulate plant species coexistence and change relationships between plants. This review will be focussed on several well documented biological processes regulating plant-plant communications such as exotic plant species invasions, negative root-root communication (allelopathy) and parasitic plant / host plant interactions and how some soil microbial components can interfere with signal traffic between roots.

First, we developed a conceptual model that predicts the influence of AMF on diversity along a soil nutrient gradient for plant communities dominated by mycotrophic and non-mycotrophic species. To test these predictions, we manipulated phosphorus to create a soil nutrient gradient for mesocosm communities composed of native prairie grasses and then compared community properties for mesocosms with and without AMF. We found that, where P was limiting, AMF increased plant diversity and productivity, and also altered community structure; however, at high P, AMF had little influence on aboveground communities. Compositional differences among treatments were due largely to a trade-off in the relative abundance of C-3 vs. C-4 species.

The /cortinarius, /russula-lactarius, and /laccaria were the most species-rich and abundant lineages in forest floor soil in Australian sites at Yarra, Victoria and Warra, Tasmania. On root tips of seedlings in dead wood, a subset of the forest floor taxa were prevalent among them species of /laccaria, /tomentella-thelephora, and /descolea, but other forest floor dominants were rare. Statistical analyses suggested that the fungal community differs between forest floor soil and dead wood at the level of both species and phylogenetic lineage. The fungal species colonizing isolated seedlings on decayed wood in austral forests were taxonomically dissimilar to the species dominating in similar habitats in Europe. We conclude that formation of a resupinate fruit body type on the underside of decayed wood is not necessarily related to preferential root colonization in decayed wood. Rather, biogeographic factors as well as differential dispersal and competitive abilities of fungal taxa are likely to play a key role in structuring the ectomycorrhizal fungal community on isolated seedlings in decaying wood.","2009",NA,"10.1007/s00572-009-0244-3","WOS:000268432700005"

Many of the most abundant functional groups in ecosystems, such as fungi and bacteria, do not fit this paradigm. In this review, we seek to understand how the elegant logic of Darwinian natural selection can be applied to distributed clonal organisms. The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are one such group. Globally, they are ubiquitous in terrestrial ecosystems, are locally distributed among many host plant species, and are significant drivers of nutrient cycling in ecosystems. The AM fungi are intractable to study, as the few taxa that can be cultured cannot be grown in the absence of plant roots. Research has focused on the plant-fungus interface, and thus on the symbiotic phenotype. A model is discussed for the interchange of materials at the interface that throws the emphasis of research onto the behaviour of the individual organisms and removes the need to test for phenomena such as selectivity, co-evolution, and cheating. The AM fungi are distributed organisms with an extensive external mycelium that is likely to be under strong environmental selection. AM fungi show sufficient phenotypic variation and fitness differentials for selection to occur, and developments in genetic analyses suggest that a better understanding of heritability in these organisms is not far away. It is argued that direct selection on fungal traits related to their survival and performance in the soil independent of the host is likely to be the major driver of differentiation in the AM fungi, and the evidence for direct fungal responses to soil conditions such as pH, hypoxia, and temperature is reviewed.","2009",NA,"10.1093/jxb/erp144","WOS:000266957900004"

Here, we investigated the distribution of genetic and phenotypic variation for a population of the cyanobacterium Mastigocladus laminosus distributed along the temperature gradient of White Creek, Yellowstone NP. A total of 153 laboratory strains were directly isolated from five sites with mean annual temperatures ranging between 39 and 54 C. Genetic characterization at four nitrogen metabolism genes identified 15 closely related lineages in the population sample. These lineages were distributed nonrandomly along White Creek, but the observed geographic structure could not be explained by limited dispersal capabilities. Temperature performance experiments with six M. laminosus lineages that maximized their respective relative abundances at different positions along the gradient provided evidence for niche differentiation within the population. Niche differentiation included a tradeoff in performance at high and low temperatures, respectively. The physiological variation of these lineages in laboratory culture was generally well matched to the prevailing temperature conditions experienced by these organisms in situ. These results suggest that sympatric diversification along an ecological selection gradient can be a potent source of evolutionary innovation in microbial populations.","2009",NA,"10.1128/AEM.01901-08","WOS:000262690100023"

However, functional differences amongst ectomycorrhizal fungi, which are pre-requisites for resource partitioning, are known primarily from lab studies; now realistic field experiments are needed in order to establish that these differences exist under field conditions. In this study, Picea engel-mannii seedlings planted in a subalpine clearcut became naturally colonized over the course of 1 y. Then a defined volume of soil around each seedling was injected with N-15-labelled nitrate, ammonium or aspartate. Seedling biomass and N content increased, but N concentration decreased, with percent colonization of root systems. Accumulation of N-15 per unit dry weight was not affected by the proportion of roots colonized but, rather, was influenced by the primary ectomycorrhizal fungus colonizing the seedling. Seedlings colonized by a Wilcoxina sp. accumulated more N-15 per g than seedlings colonized by a Cenococcum sp. The presence of dark septate hyphae in the mantle was associated with lower accumulation of N-15 by seedlings colonized by Amphinema byssoides. Our results demonstrate that the physiological differences required to support the concept of niche differentiation amongst ectomycorrhizal fungi exist in the field.

"Salles, JF; Poly, F; Schmid, B; Le Roux, X","Community niche predicts the functioning of denitrifying bacterial assemblages","ECOLOGY","Predicting biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning requires adequate evaluation of the mechanisms explaining why more diverse systems could perform better than less diverse ones. In this context, tackling functional diversity has become an important issue. Even though the aggregation of species into functional groups supposes niche differences among groups, the concept of niche has not been fully exploited in the context of the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research. Here we report the results of microcosm experiments where we used bacteria as a model to explore whether niche differences among species provide a good estimation of community functioning. For that we used experimental communities of denitrifying bacterial species and investigated the effects of bacterial diversity on two community processes, denitrification and anaerobic CO2-production. We first measured the activities of 16 bacterial species grown individually on six different carbon sources. We then used the same set of species to assemble communities varying in both species richness and composition in microcosms containing a mixture of all six carbon sources. The performances of individual species on individual carbon sources were used to calculate, for each process measured, an a priori index called community niche'' that accounted for the performances of the species present in a given community across the entire range of the six resources. We found that species richness had a positive but small effect on both community processes whereas community niche explained a much larger proportion of the variation. According to the results of a path analysis, community niche was the main driver for the corresponding community process, but species richness affected community niche and thus had an indirect effect on denitrification and CO2 production. In addition to community niche, the presence of particular bacterial species also influenced community functioning, indicating that other effects than the capacity to use carbon sources played a, albeit minor, role in our experiment. Our study provides evidence for the importance of resource niches in shaping biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships of bacterial communities.","2009",NA,"10.1890/09-0188.1","WOS:000272700800005"

"Zhang, QG; Buckling, A; Godfray, HCJ","Quantifying the relative importance of niches and neutrality for coexistence in a model microbial system","FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY","P>1. Ecologists have identified two types of processes promoting species coexistence: stabilizing mechanisms (niche differentiation and related processes) that increase negative intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interactions, and equalizing mechanisms (neutrality) that minimize the differences in species' demographic parameters. It has been theoretically and empirically shown that the two types of mechanisms can operate simultaneously; however, their relative importance remains unstudied although this is a key question in the synthesis of niche and neutral theories. 2. We experimentally quantified the relative importance of niche and neutral mechanisms in promoting phenotypic diversity in a model microbial system involving different phenotypes of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens. Initially isogenic populations of the bacterium can diversify into a series of major and minor classes of phenotypes that can be treated as analogues of species. We estimated the relative population growth rate when rare of 32 phenotypes from six replicate microcosms. Each phenotype was assessed in a re-assembled microcosm in which the relative densities of all phenotypes remained the same except for the focal one which was reduced in frequency. A growth rate advantage when rare was considered evidence of non-neutral processes. 3. Approximately one-third of the phenotypes had a growth rate advantage when rare while the remaining two-thirds showed neutral or near-neutral dynamics. Furthermore, there was overall little evidence that productivity increased with phenotypic diversity. 4. Our results suggest that niche and neutral processes may simultaneously contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity, with the latter playing a more important role in our system, and that the operation of niche mechanisms does not necessarily lead to a positive biodiversity effect on ecosystem properties.","2009",NA,"10.1111/j.1365-2435.2009.01579.x","WOS:000271632200014"

We hypothesize that the spatial scale at which food is distributed in the sediment is an important factor determining the outcome of this competition. Macrobenthic deposit feeders are better adapted for fast consumption of food in concentrated patches, whereas diluted food can only be exploited by bacteria. This hypothesis was tested in an experiment in which a fixed quantity of isotopically labeled algal detritus was offered to a natural bacterial community and the polychaete worm Nereis (=Hediste) diversicolor, either as a concentrated patch or mixed through the sediment matrix. Worms dominated food uptake in the concentrated treatment, while bacterial uptake was much greater in the diluted treatment. The experiment demonstrated scale-based niche differentiation between these taxonomically distant groups. It also showed that worms spatially redistributed food and made it available to bacteria in that way. Together, these mechanisms may stimulate stable co-existence through a scale-based partitioning of resources.","2009",NA,"10.4319/lo.2009.54.5.1413","WOS:000268325300001"

To date, however, few studies have addressed the ecological mechanisms underlying sympatry in cryptic and pseudocryptic species. As a result, we have only a limited understanding of the factors that govern their distribution along environmental gradients. Here, we used the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS), 18S rRNA gene, and the RUBISCO LSU (rbcL) chloroplast gene sequence data together with cell wall morphology to show that estuarine populations of the widespread and common benthic diatom Navicula phyllepta Kutz. consist of pseudocryptic species. Growth rate measurements in function of salinity showed that N. phyllepta strains assigned to the different species differed in their tolerance to low salinities (< 5 practical salinity units, psu), which was reflected by their different (but widely overlapping) distribution in the Westerschelde estuary (the Netherlands). Multiple regression analyses of the factors determining the abundance of the different species in field samples revealed that, in addition to salinity, sediment type and ammonium concentrations were probably equally important.

DNA was subsequently extracted from individual root tips for polymerase chain reaction, restriction fragment length polymorphism, and rDNA sequencing of the ITS1/5.8S/ITS2 region to determine identities of fungal morphotypes. Twelve distinct molecular types were identified. Analysis of similarity showed that ECM fungal assemblages shifted significantly in composition across the soil moisture gradient. Taxa within the genus Tuber and the family Thelephoraceae were largely responsible for the changes in fungal assemblages. There were also significant differences in ECM community assemblages between the two oak host species.

The interaction webs of specialist sacoglossans were investigated on the Pacific shore of Honshu, Japan. The host use of the small stenophagous sacoglossan opisthobranch Placida sp. (sensu Baba, 1986) was investigated in association with the green macroalgae Codium spp. Based on field associations, Placida sp. attacked six congeneric algal host species out of eight investigated (75%) in and around Sagami Bay and ten of 20 species (50%) in Japan. In pairwise-choice feeding experiments, Placida sp. preferred the algal host from which it was collected (source alga) to alternate host and non-host algae. Preference rankings, however, could be altered based on the condition or identity of the choices (e.g. old versus young fronds of C. fragile). Connectance values were lower in these high-diversity assemblages than in their low-diversity counterparts on other temperate shores (but these values may increase with additional study). The sacoglossan occasionally coexisted with two other common sacoglossan species (Elysia trisinuata and E. setoensis) and several other less common ones. However, interspecific feeding interactions appeared minor, with no discernible evidence of interference or exploitation competition.

In this study, animals, roots, soil and litter material from a temperate deciduous forest were analysed. The combined measurement of delta N-15 and delta C-13 provided insights into the compartmentalization of the soil animal food web. Leaf litter feeders were separated from animals relying mainly on recent belowground carbon resources and from animals feeding on older carbon. The trophic pathway of leaf litter-feeding species appears to be a dead end, presumably because leaf litter feeders (mainly diplopods and oribatid mites) are unavailable to predators due to large size and/or strong sclerotization. Endogeic earthworms that rely on older carbon also appear to exist in predator-free space. The data suggest that the largest trophic compartment constitutes of ectomycorrhizal feeders and their predators. Additionally, there is a smaller trophic compartment consisting of predators likely feeding on enchytraeids and potentially nematodes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

These two plants differed in both wastewater characteristics and operating parameters, such as influent COD, TKN, ammonium, hydraulic retention time, and solids retention time, even though both plants achieve > 85% nitrification efficiency. By employing molecular techniques, including terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, cloning-sequencing and phylogenetic analyses targeting the 16S ribosomal RNA and group specific ammonia-monooxygenase functional gene (amoA), microbial community structures of nitrifying sludge and their significance to nitrification performance were evaluated. The results reveal that for the municipal WWTP Nitrosomonas marina-like AOB (ammonia-oxidizing bacteria) and Nitrospira-like NOB (nitrite-oxidizing bacteria) were the ubiquitously dominant nitrifiers, while Nitrosomonas europaea-, Nitrosomonas oligotropha-, and Nitrosospira-like AOB and Nitrobacter- and Nitrospira-like NOB were the major nitrifying populations found in the swine WWTP. The observed dissimilar nitrifying populations prevailing in these two plants may be related to niche differentiation concerning ammonium concentrations, system operation, and salinity. Moreover, our results suggest that the swine nitrifying sludge, involving relatively diverse AOB and NOB populations that perform the same task but with distinct growth and survival characters, may allow communities to maintain nitrifying capabilities when conditions change such as sudden increases in ammonium concentrations as examined with nitrification kinetic batch tests.

Two basins with contrasting influx of allochthonous organic carbon were sampled during late summer stratification (oxic and anoxic layers) and after autumn mixing. High total and cell-specific incorporation rates were observed for glucose and HBA in stratified and mixed waters respectively, but only a small fraction of bacteria visibly incorporated HBA. The oxic layer of the more humic-rich basin featured a significantly lower fraction of glucose incorporating cells and substantially higher proportions of acetate assimilating bacteria. Niche differentiation was observed in two betaproteobacterial populations: cells affiliated with the Polynucleobacter C subcluster efficiently incorporated acetate but little glucose, whereas the opposite was found for members of the R-BT065 clade. By contrast, leucine incorporation was variable in both taxa. Considering the high concentrations and rapid photochemical generation of organic acids in humic waters our results may help to explain the success of the Polynucleobacter C lineage in such habitats. Specific substrate or habitat preferences were also present in three subgroups of the actinobacterial acI lineage: The numerically dominant clade in oxic waters (acI-840-1) was absent in the anoxic zone and did not incorporate acetate. A second group (acI-840-2) was found both in the epi- and hypolimnion, whereas the third one (acI-840-3) only occurred in anoxic waters.

Within each stage, plants from plots with different legume cover were compared. Soil inorganic N content, total plant biomass and delta N-15 values of bulk plant material were significantly lower in the pioneer stage than in the ruderal grass community. The observed delta N-15 differences were rather species- than site-specific. Within both stages, there were also species-specific differences in isotopic composition between above- and belowground plant dry matter. Species-specific delta N-15 signatures may theoretically be explained by (i) isotopic fractionation during microbial-mediated soil N transformations; (ii) isotopic fractionation during plant N uptake or fractionation during plant-mycorrhiza transfer processes; (iii) differences in metabolic pathways and isotopic fractionation within the plant; or (iv) partitioning of available N resources (or pools) among plant groups or differential use of the same resources by different species, which seems to be the most probable route in the present case. A significant influence of N-2-fixing legumes on the N balance of the surrounding plant community was not detectable.

We examined the preference of seven oribatid mite species (Adoristes ovatus, Eniochthonius minutissimus, Eueremaeus silvestris, Nothrus silvestris, Oppiella subpectinata, Porobelba spinosa and Spatiodamaeus verticillipes) for nine autochthonous saprotrophic fungi from Scots pine litter (Pinus sylvestris). Among the fungal species offered were specific coniferous litter colonizers (Allantophomopsis lycopodina, Ceuthospora pinastri, Hormonema dematioides, Scleroconidioma sphagnicola, Verticicladium trifidum, Marasmius androsaceus and Sympodiella acicola) and two ubiquitous species (Cladosporium herbarum and Oidiodendron griseum). The fungi were inoculated on fragments of pine needles and offered simultaneously and separately to the mites. Our main hypothesis, that oribatid mites (usually occurring in more than one type of ecosystems) would prefer the ubiquitous fungal species rather than those specific to pine litter, was supported only partly. The ubiquitous C herbarum was highly preferred by all studied mites, but most of them preferred one or more of the specialized fungi with similar intensity. The basidiomycete M. androsaceus along with sterile needles were consistently avoided by all mites in all experiments. Our results do not support the hypothesis, that the true fungivorous oribatid mites in traditional sense are more selective fungal feeders than are the unspecialized panphytophagous ones. We observed no gradation in preference of fungi for oribatid mites as a group, but rather a discontinuous and dynamic mosaic with particular mites preferring particular fungal species. This heterogeneous mosaic shapes the feeding niches occupied by particular oribatid mite species and probably reduces competition for food source among numerous species coexisting in a given habitat and time.

Intact cores containing Eriophorum vaginatum, Eriophorum angustifolium, Calluna vulgaris and bare soil were removed and a mesh bag with litter from only one of each of these species or fragments of the moss Sphagnum auriculatum was added to each core in a factorial design. The presence or absence of live plants, regardless of the species, had no effect on mass loss, C, nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P) concentrations of the litter following 12 months of incubation. However, there was a very strong effect of litter type on mass loss and concentrations of C, N and P between most combinations of litter. Similarly. plant species did not affect fungal community structure but litter type had a strong effect, with significant differences between most pairs of litter types. The data suggest that labile C inputs via rhizodeposition from a range of plant functional types that have colonised cutover bogs for 10-15 years have little direct effect on nutrient turnover from plant litter and in shaping litter fungal community structure. In contrast, the chemistry of the litter they produce has much stronger and varied effects on decomposition and fungal community composition. Thus it appears that there is distinct niche differentiation between the fungal communities involved in turnover of litter versus rhizodeposits in the early phases of plant succession on regenerating cutover peatlands.

Heating protocols range from the lightly heated not from concentrate, NFC, to the twice heated, reconstituted from concentrate, RFC, juices. Thermal processing profoundly effects aroma composition. Aroma volatiles are further altered by subsequent time-temperature storage conditions.

"Klausmeier, CA","Floquet theory: a useful tool for understanding nonequilibrium dynamics","THEORETICAL ECOLOGY","Many ecological systems experience periodic variability. Theoretical investigation of population and community dynamics in periodic environments has been hampered by the lack of mathematical tools relative to equilibrium systems. Here, I describe one such mathematical tool that has been rarely used in the ecological literature but has widespread use: Floquet theory. Floquet theory is the study of the stability of linear periodic systems in continuous time. Floquet exponents/multipliers are analogous to the eigenvalues of Jacobian matrices of equilibrium points. In this paper, I describe the general theory, then give examples to illustrate some of its uses: it defines fitness of structured populations, it can be used for invasion criteria in models of competition, and it can test the stability of limit cycle solutions. I also provide computer code to calculate Floquet exponents and multipliers.","2008",NA,"10.1007/s12080-008-0016-2","WOS:000270331600003"

The model identified a criterion for invasion into carbon-limited environments with two characteristics driving fungal growth, namely the carbon decomposition rate and a measure of carbon use efficiency. The dynamics of fungal spread through a population of sites with either low (0.0074 mg) or high (0.016 mg) carbon content were well described by the simplified model with faster colonization for the carbon-rich environment. Rhizoctonia solani responded to a lower carbon availability by increasing the carbon use efficiency and the carbon decomposition rate following colonization. The results are discussed in relation to fungal invasion thresholds in terms of carbon nutrition.","2008",NA,"10.1111/j.1469-8137.2008.02394.x","WOS:000255061500017"
"Sarnelle, O; Wilson, AE","Type III functional response in Daphnia","ECOLOGY","The functional response of Daphnia, a common pelagic herbivore in lakes, was assessed with a combination of secondary and meta-analyses of published data and new data from an experiment conducted using very low food levels. Secondary analyses of literature data (28 studies, n = 239-393) revealed a significant positive influence of food concentration on Daphnia clearance rate at low food levels, i.e., evidence of an overall Type III functional response. This result was not an artifact of including data from Daphnia that were exhausted from prolonged food deprivation (more than three hours at very low food). Meta-analysis of Daphnia clearance rate vs. food concentration across a range of low food concentrations (eight studies) showed a significantly positive slope across studies, which also supports the presence of a Type III response. Congruent with these analyses of published data, the feeding experiment showed clear evidence of a Type III functional response for D. pulicaria feeding on Ankistrodesmus falcatus. Food levels at which Daphnia clearance rate declined with decreasing food were near the minimum resource requirement for Daphnia population maintenance at steady state (R*). We suggest that Type III responses are more common than previously believed, perhaps because of the relative paucity of observations at low food levels, and that reduced prey mortality at low phytoplankton densities could be a stabilizing mechanism for Daphnia-phytoplankton systems under resource scarcity.","2008",NA,"10.1890/07-0935.1","WOS:000256540300025"

"Fenton, A; Brockhurst, MA","The role of specialist parasites in structuring host communities","ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH","Natural enemies can be a powerful force when structuring natural communities, and in facilitating or preventing species coexistence depending on the nature of the trophic interaction. In particular, keystone predators can promote species coexistence, provided they preferentially attack the competitively dominant species. However, it is not clear whether parasites can play a similar structuring role; parasites typically form chronic associations with their victims, reducing their fitness (i.e., fecundity) rather than survival, and allowing infected hosts to remain viable competitors within the community. Therefore the density-dependent suppression of the host is likely to be more subtle than that due to predation. Using a series of simple population-dynamic models we show that specialist parasites can facilitate species coexistence, although possibly less so than predators. These results contrast with those typically found with models of generalist parasites, which can reduce the likelihood of species coexistence through apparent competition. In addition, we show that the likelihood of parasite-facilitated species coexistence depends greatly on the specific type of parasite. In particular, macroparasites (e.g., parasitic helminths) may be less likely to facilitate species coexistence than microparasites (e.g., viruses or bacteria) due to their typically highly aggregated distribution amongst their hosts. Furthermore, species coexistence is more likely if the parasite is relatively benign to its host. Parasitism by apparently harmless specialist parasites may provide an important but overlooked factor in the maintenance of species diversity, facilitating species invasions into new communities and the emergence of novel infectious diseases.","2008",NA,"10.1007/s11284-007-0440-6","WOS:000258758000001"

These studies were to understand the relative potential co-existence, nutritional partitioning and niche exclusion in bread-based matrices, The niche size decreased significantly with decrease in water availability, temperature and pH. There were also significant interactive effects between pH and the preservative. The data were used to determine the niche overlap indices (NOI) of competing fungi relative to the two ochratoxigenic species, These showed that P. verrucosum and A. ochraceus were nutritionally dominant over the other species. The NOIs showed that potential co-existence and/or niche exclusion was influenced by environmental factors. Overall, the addition of the preservative increased the interspecific competition for nutrients. The level of co-existence and nutritional partitioning was significantly modified by abiotic factors, and this can help explain the dominance of specific fungal species in food matrices. This approach could also be useful for understanding competitiveness and dominance of fungal species in other ecosystems, especially in relation to impacts of abiotic and biotic factors.

Since the microbial community regulates N-form transformations, plant partitioning of N may be related to plant-soil feedbacks. We conducted a N-15 tracer addition experiment to study the ability of two alpine plant species, Acomastylis rossii and Deschampsia caespitosa, to partition organic and inorganic forms of N. The species are codominant and associated with strong plant-soil feedbacks that affect N cycling. We manipulated interspecific interactions by removing Acomastylis or Deschampsia from areas where the species were codominant to test if N uptake patterns varied in the presence of the other species. We found that Deschampsia acquired organic and inorganic N more rapidly than Acomastylis, regardless of neighbor treatment. Plant N uptake-specifically ammonium uptake-increased with plant density and the presence of an interspecific neighbor. Interestingly, this change in N uptake was not in the expected direction to reduce niche overlap and instead suggested facilitation of ammonium use. To test if N acquisition patterns were consistent with plant-soil feedbacks, we also compared microbial rhizosphere extracellular enzyme activity in patches dominated by one or the other species and in areas where they grew together. The presence of both species was generally associated with increased rhizosphere extracellular enzyme activity (five of ten enzymes) and a trend towards increased foliar N concentrations. Taken together, these results suggest that feedbacks through the microbial community, either in response to increased plant density or specific plant neighbors, could facilitate coexistence. However, coexistence is promoted via enhanced resource uptake rather than reduced niche overlap. The importance of resource partitioning to reduce the intensity of competitive interactions might vary across systems, particularly as a function of plant-soil feedbacks.","2008",NA,"10.1007/s00442-008-1006-1","WOS:000255680000014"

"Laird, RA; Schamp, BS","Does local competition increase the coexistence of species in intransitive networks?","ECOLOGY","Competitive intransitivity, a situation in which species' competitive ranks cannot be listed in a strict hierarchy, promotes species coexistence through enemy's enemy indirect facilitation. Theory suggests that intransitivity-mediated coexistence is enhanced when competitive interactions occur at local spatial scales, although this hypothesis has not been thoroughly tested. Here, we use a lattice model to investigate the effect of local vs. global competition on intransitivity-mediated coexistence across I range of species richness values and levels of intransitivity. Our simulations show that local competition can enhance intransitivity-mediated coexistence in the short term, yet hinder it in the long term, when compared to global competition. This occurs because local competition slows species disaggregation, allowing weaker competitors to persist longer in the shifting spatial refuges of intransitive networks, enhancing short-term coexistence. Conversely, our simulations show that, in the long term, local competition traps disaggregated species in unfavorable areas of the competitive arena, where they are excluded by superior competitors. As a result, in the long term, global intransitive competition allows a greater number of species to coexist than local intransitive competition.","2008",NA,"10.1890/07-0117.1","WOS:000253717200026"

The bacterial influence on fungal growth in a soil system was studied by applying three different bacterial inhibitors - bronopol, tylosin and oxytetracycline - in a series of increasing concentrations, and comparing the resulting bacterial and fungal growth rates measured using leucine and acetate-in-ergosterol incorporation, respectively. Direct measurements of growth showed that fungi increased after adding inhibitors; the level of increase in fungal growth corresponded to that of the decrease in bacterial growth, irrespective of the bacterial inhibitor used. Similar antagonistic effects of the bacteria on fungal growth were also found after adding the bacterial inhibitors together with additional substrate (alfalfa or straw plant material). The resulting responses in bacterial and fungal growth indirectly indicated that the negative interaction between fungi and bacteria was mostly attributable to exploitation competition.

However, recent studies showed that Gammarus sp. may have high diet diversity (as animals, moss, algae). In this context, we quantity the diet of Gammarus fossa rum to highlight and statistically consider what many authors affirmed rather by observation. To this end, we used a recently described multivariate analysis, called %PCA, which allows investigating data dealing with diet composition. Body size and microhabitat type were revealed highly significant variables governing several parameters of the diet. In particular, our results show that food item size and predatory behaviour increased with body size, whilst the type and abundance of food consumed was related to microhabitat type. Furthermore, body-size had a significant effect on specialisation whatever the microhabitat type. Niche overlap also decreased as pairwise differences in body-size increased, allowing the aggregation of individuals from different instars. We conclude that G. fossarum exhibit an opportunistic behaviour, which makes necessary to reconsider the importance of gammarid shredding activity to accurately assess stream functioning and flux/redistribution of energy and matter (leaf litter breakdown).

However, direct experimental demonstrations of character displacement due to competition are rare. Results: We demonstrate a causal role for competition in ecological character displacement. Using populations of the bacterium Escherichia coli that have adaptively diversified into ecotypes exploiting different carbon resources, we show that when interspecific competition is relaxed, phenotypic distributions converge. When we reinstate competition, phenotypic distributions diverge.

However, in the simplest case with three competing types, the long-term outcome may not be so clear if two of the three represent the ends of a continuous heritable trait distribution within one species, as has been recently demonstrated empirically in a short-term experiment with plants. Using simulation models of this scenario, results with asexual reproduction confirm previous studies which showed that local interactions promote coexistence. However, with sexual reproduction, genetic variance is reduced because selection fluctuates between favouring the two extremes during population cycles, while sex continually produces intermediates. Sex thus slows the response to selection when it is the strongest and therefore slows the recovery from extreme abundances, creating larger abundance fluctuations. Local interactions do not stabilize dynamics with sex because the resultant spatial patches of one species are genetically heterogeneous, such that particular phenotypes do not benefit from spatial refuges. In sharp contrast to previous models suggesting that sex or local interactions stabilize population dynamics, here sex and local interactions destabilize dynamics and increase extinction risk.","2008",NA,"10.1098/rspb.2008.0402","WOS:000257246900005"

Beringian paleontological records store a wealth of information that can be used to investigate how predator-prey and competitive interactions among consumers shifted in response to past episodes of environmental change. Two such recent periods of rapid climate change are the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the end of glacial conditions at the beginning of the Holocene. Here we assemble carbon and nitrogen stable isotope, and AMS C-14 data collected from bone collagen of late Pleistocene carnivores and megafaunal prey species from the interior of eastern Beringia (Alaska), and reconstruct the diets of ancient Alaskan carnivores and herbivores. We are able to account for the relative influences of diet versus changing environmental conditions on variances in consumer isotope values, to identify species hiatuses in the fossil record, and to draw conclusions about paleoenvironmental conditions from faunal chronologies. Our isotopic results suggest that there was dietary niche overlap among some Beringian herbivore species, and partitioning among other species. We rely upon delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of modem Alaskan C-3 plant types to infer Beringian herbivore dietary niches. Horse, bison, yak, and mammoth primarily consumed grasses, sedges, and herbaceous plant species. Caribou and woodland muskox focused upon tundra plants, including lichen, fungi, and mosses. The network of Beringian carnivore interaction was complex and dynamic, some species (wolves) persisted for long periods of time, while others were only present during specific timeframes (large felids and ursids). Beringian carnivore diets included all measured herbivore species, although mammoth and muskox only appeared in carnivore diets during specific times in the late Pleistocene. We identified the potential presence of unmeasured diet sources that may have included forest-dwelling cervids and/or plant materials. None of the large-bodied carnivore species we analyzed (except short-faced bear) were specialized predators of a single prey species during the late Pleistocene. Differences in carnivore diet and dietary breadth between time periods either reflect changes in the relative abundances of prey on the Beringian landscape, or changes in competitive interactions among Beringian carnivore species.

Wood-decaying fungi are ubiquitous and functionally important organisms within forest ecosystems world-wide, but remarkably little is known of their population dynamics in relation to the dynamics of their host substrates. Living in transient environments, where local extinctions are caused by gradual substrate (patch) destruction or deterioration due to wood decomposition, the long-term persistence of these species requires successful colonization of new patches. 2. During a 6-year period, we examined the colonization-extinction dynamics of wood-decaying fungi (Aphyllophorales: Polyporaceae and Corticiaceae) in relation to the spatiotemporal distribution of host logs within a boreal old-growth Norway spruce (Picea abies) forest. 3. The dynamics of the species studied were strongly influenced by both local log characteristics (within patch) and connectivity (between patch). Several species (e.g. Asterodon ferruginosus, Phellinus ferrugineofuscus, P. viticola, Phlebia centrifuga) showed a positive effect of connectivity, mainly colonizing logs in the vicinity of previously occupied logs. This implies that some wood-decaying fungi may be dispersal limited in terms of successful colonizations. The relative importance of patch conditions and connectivity was however, highly species specific. 4. Our results further illustrate the importance of life-strategies adopted by species that are present during different stages of wood decomposition. Early colonizers were primarily affected by the stage of decomposition; secondary colonizers were affected by a variety of within patch and/or between patch variables, maintaining high species coexistence within intermediate stages of decay. Phellinus nigrolimitatus was the dominant polyporous decayer at the final stages of decomposition, clearly gaining a competitive advantage from specializing on highly decomposed wood and having very low mean annual mortality rates. 5. Local extinction rates were higher on small diameter logs than large diameter logs, and generally increased as decay proceeded, illustrating the importance of deterministic patch destruction due to wood decomposition. 6. Synthesis. The fungi-log study system was highly dynamic, illustrating that both characteristics and spatiotemporal availability of logs are important in explaining the distribution patterns and population dynamics of wood-decaying fungal communities. The result implies that the dynamics of some wood-decaying fungi can be characterized as patch-tracking metapopulations, with connectivity-dependent colonizations and local extinctions caused by the turnover of the patches.","2008",NA,"10.1111/j.1365-2745.2008.01411.x","WOS:000258379800024"

Subsequently, ENF was readministered for 4 weeks as pulse intensification. Methods: The proportion of plasma virus carrying the V38A mutation in gp41 was quantified by allele-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction in serial samples collected from 3 subjects at 1- to 4-week intervals. Fitness differences were calculated using a method that corrected for time dependence of the viral replication rate. Results: The V38A mutant made up >= 85% of the quasispecies at baseline and decayed to < 5% over 12-24 weeks-, plasma HIV-1 RNA levels remained stable during this time. Fitness differences for mutant versus wild type ranged from -25% to -65%, providing in vivo evidence for the reduced fitness of ENF-resistant HIV-1. The V38A mutant virus reemerged rapidly during the ENF pulse. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the HIV-1 quasispecies undergoes dynamic changes in response to withdrawal and reinitiation of fusion inhibitor therapy.

In ecology, such negative plant-soil feedbacks may be viewed as a type of Janzen-Connell effect, which promotes species coexistence and diversity by preventing the same species from repeatedly occupying a particular site. In a controlled greenhouse experiment with 24 plant species and using soils from established. field monocultures, we reveal community-wide soil-based Janzen-Connell effects between the three major functional groups of plants in temperate European grasslands. The effects are much stronger and more prevalent if plants are grown in interspecific competition. Using several soil treatments (gamma irradiation, activated carbon, fungicide, fertilizer) we show that the mechanism of the negative feedback is the buildup of soil pathogens which reduce the competitive ability of nearly all species when grown on soils they have formerly occupied. We further show that the magnitude of the change in competitive outcome is sufficient to stabilize observed. fitness differences between functional groups in reasonably large communities. The generality and strength of this negative feedback suggests that Janzen-Connell effects have been underestimated as drivers of plant diversity in temperate ecosystems.","2008",NA,"10.1890/07-2056.1","WOS:000259259300005"

These physiological differences suggest niche differentiation among these bacteria depending on the environmental conditions. Species of AOB might be adapted to different zones in the flooding gradient of a tidal marsh. This issue has been studied by sampling sediments from different sites and depths within a tidal freshwater marsh along the river Scheldt near the village of Appels in Belgium. Samples were taken in February, April, July and October 1998. Communities of AOB in the sediment were analysed on the basis of the 16S rRNA gene by application of polymerase chain reaction in combination with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). In addition, moisture content and concentrations of ammonium and nitrate were determined as well as the potential ammonia-oxidizing activities. Six different DGGE bands belonging to the beta-subclass of the Proteobacteria were observed across the marsh. The community composition of AOB was determined by the elevation in the flooding gradient as well as by the sampling depth. The presence of plants was less important for the community composition of AOB. DGGE bands affiliated with the Nitrosospira lineage were mostly found in the upper part of the marsh and in the deeper layers of the sediment. Two of the three DGGE bands related to the Nitrosomonas oligotropha lineage were more broadly distributed over the marsh, but were predominantly found in the upper layers of the sediment. Members of the environmental Nitrosomonas lineage 5 were predominantly detected in the deeper layers in the lower parts of the marsh.

Oxygen and sulfide concentrations in the cave waters range over more than two orders of magnitude as a result of seasonally and spatially variable dilution of the sulfidic groundwater. A full-cycle rRNA approach was used to quantify dominant populations in biofilms collected in both diluted and undiluted zones. Sulfide concentration profiles within biofilms were obtained in situ using microelectrode voltammetry. Populations in rock-attached streamers depended on the sulfide/oxygen supply ratio of bulk water (r = 0.97; P<0.0001). Filamentous epsilonproteobacteria dominated at high sulfide to oxygen ratios (>150), whereas Thiothrix dominated at low ratios (<75). In contrast, Beggiatoa was the dominant group in biofilms at the sediment - water interface regardless of sulfide and oxygen concentrations or supply ratio.

"Weis, JJ; Madrigal, DS; Cardinale, BJ","Effects of Algal Diversity on the Production of Biomass in Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Nutrient Environments: A Microcosm Experiment","PLOS ONE","Background: One of the most common questions addressed by ecologists over the past decade has been-how does species richness impact the production of community biomass? Recent summaries of experiments have shown that species richness tends to enhance the production of biomass across a wide range of trophic groups and ecosystems; however, the biomass of diverse polycultures only rarely exceeds that of the single most productive species in a community ( a phenomenon called 'transgressive overyielding'). Some have hypothesized that the lack of transgressive overyielding is because experiments have generally been performed in overly-simplified, homogeneous environments where species have little opportunity to express the niche differences that lead to 'complementary' use of resources that can enhance biomass production. We tested this hypothesis in a laboratory experiment where we manipulated the richness of freshwater algae in homogeneous and heterogeneous nutrient environments. Methodology/Principal Findings: Experimental units were comprised of patches containing either homogeneous nutrient ratios (16:1 nitrogen to phosphorus (N:P) in all patches) or heterogeneous nutrient ratios ( ranging from 4:1 to 64:1 N:P across patches). After allowing 6-10 generations of algal growth, we found that algal species richness had similar impacts on biomass production in both homo- and heterogeneous environments. Although four of the five algal species showed a strong response to nutrient heterogeneity, a single species dominated algal communities in both types of environments. As a result, a 'selection effect'-where diversity maximizes the chance that a competitively superior species will be included in, and dominate the biomass of a community-was the primary mechanism by which richness influenced biomass in both homo- and heterogeneous environments. Conclusions/Significance: Our study suggests that spatial heterogeneity, by itself, is not sufficient to generate strong effects of biodiversity on productivity. Rather, heterogeneity must be coupled with variation in the relative fitness of species across patches in order for spatial niche differentiation to generate complementary resource use.","2008",NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0002825","WOS:000264304300044"

Here, we investigate the role of dispersal in determining both diversity and productivity over evolutionary timescales, using experimental metacommunities of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens assembled by divergent natural selection. We show that both regional diversity and productivity peak at an intermediate dispersal rate. Moreover, we demonstrate that these two patterns are linked: selection at intermediate rates of dispersal leads to high niche differentiation between genotypes, allowing greater coverage of the heterogeneous environment and a higher regional productivity.

Undisturbed forest floor, windthrow mounds and pits harboured more species than brown- and white-rotted wood.

Generally, the most frequent species in dead wood were also common in forest floor soil. Ordination analyses suggested that decay type determined the composition of EcM fungal community in dead wood. Root connections with in-growing mature tree roots from below affected the occurrence of certain fungal species on seedling roots systems in dead wood. This study demonstrates that ectomycorrhizal fungi differentially establish in certain forest microsites that is attributable to their dispersal and competitive abilities. Elevated microsites, especially decayed wood, act as seed beds for both ectomycorrhizal forest trees and fungi, thus affecting the succession of boreal forest ecosystems.","2008",NA,"10.1111/j.1462-2920.2007.01535.x","WOS:000254666700009"

The consumption of the oxygen during the night establishes a diurnal fluctuation of the redox conditions (- 320 mV to +300 mv) that explains the coexistence of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in the rhizosphere. The redox fluctuation and its effect on the activity of rhizosphere microorganisms were investigated by RNA-based fingerprinting techniques in a laboratory scale reactor planted with Juncus effusus. The denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) patterns of 16S rRNA obtained with universal primers were very similar regardless of the time of sampling, indicating that the overall ribosome level of the predominantly active members did not change significantly. The amoA transcript DGGE patterns showed moderate diurnal dynamics with specific bands observed either in day or night samples. However, the majority of amoA genes were continuously expressed, indicating that the activity of functional genes may only partly be a measure sensitive enough for tracing the physiological activity on a short time scale. The results indicate that loose regulation of functional genes can be the main strategy for accommodation to fluctuating environmental conditions. The spatial separation of microbial activities as a result of diurnal fluctuating oxygen availability probably contributes to niche differentiation in the rhizosphere but this is difficult to track it at transcriptome level.

The assemblages were diverse and characterized by high inter-annual variability, rather than a clear seasonal pattern. In order to identify the main environmental drivers of community changes, several regional (river runoff, rainfall, upwelling, radiation, daylength) and in situ (sea surface temperature, salinity, bottom and Surface chlorophyll a concentration) environmental parameters were tested. Multivariate statistical analysis allowed the identification of water stability as the main environmental gradient influencing, the community composition, with river runoff in the preceding rain season and upwelling being the two drivers of stratification and turbulence, respectively. Both these processes can be described as nutrient enrichment processes, but the cyst signal indicates that the two mechanisms select for different functional groups. The main upwelling cyst signal is characterised by the dominance of heterotrophic species (Protoperidinioid species) and presence of the autotrophic chain-forming Gymnodinium catenatum, while the river runoff Cyst signal is characterised by dominance of autotrophs forming calcareous cysts, mainly Scrippsiella spp. Lingulodinium polyedrum is suggested to be indicative of upwelling conditions in the region but reflecting an ecological niche different from the more classical heterotrophic assemblage and G. catenatum.

This observation implied that EcM fungi can dissolve mineral grains. The observation raised several questions on the ecology of these rock-eating fungi. This review addresses the roles of these rock-eating EcM associations in plant nutrition, biogeochemical cycles and pedogenesis. Research approaches ranged from molecular to ecosystem level scales. Nutrient deficiencies change EcM seedling exudation patterns of organic anions and thus their potential to mobilise base cations from minerals. This response was fungal species-specific. Some EcM fungi accelerated mineral weathering. While mineral weathering could also increase the concentrations of phytotoxic aluminium in the soil solution, some EcM fungi increase Al tolerance through an enhanced exudation of oxalate. Through their contribution to Al transport, EcM hyphae could be agents in pedogenesis, especially podzolisation. A modelling study indicated that mineral tunnelling is less important than surface weathering by EcM fungi. With both processes taken together, the contribution of EcM fungi to weathering may be significant. In the field vertical niche differentiation of EcM fungi was shown for EcM root tips and extraradical mycelium. In the field EcM fungi and tunnel densities were correlated. Our results support a role of rock-eating EcM fungi in plant nutrition and biogeochemical cycles.

In a shade-house experiment (1% full sun), we tested seedling life span, growth, and mass allocation responses to microbial extract filtered from conspecific-cultured soil in 21 tree species that varied in abundance and shade tolerance in a wet tropical forest (La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica). Forty-three percent of the species had significant reductions, and 10% of the species had significant increases in life span, growth, root length, or root surface area when inoculated with microbial extract; 10% of the species experienced opposing reductions and increases in these characteristics. Contrary to expectation, species' local abundance was not related to species-specific responses to microbial extracts from cultured soils. Across species, seedling shade tolerance (survival at 1% full sun) was negatively correlated with susceptibility to the microbial treatment for both survival and total mass accumulation, thereby exaggerating shade tolerance differences among species. Thus, soil pathogens may contribute to species coexistence through heightening niche differentiation rather than through negative density dependence in common species.","2008",NA,"10.1890/07-0211.1","WOS:000258007500011"

The two litter types differed strongly in nitrogen concentration, suggesting that G. emarginata (1.21% N) decomposes faster than P. nutans (0.73% N). To study the effect of soil micro-arthropods on the decomposition process, litterbags with mesh-size of 48 Am, excluding soil micro-arthropods, and I mm, allowing colonization by soil micro-arthropods, were used. Litter mass loss was measured after 2, 6 and 12 mo exposure in the field; further, microbial biomass and micro-arthropod colonization of the litter were investigated after 2 and 12mo.

This urgency spurred the publication of many short-term studies, which often report weak effects of diversity (species richness) driven by the presence of key species (the sampling effect). Longer-term field experiments are slowly accumulating, and they more often report strong diversity effects driven by species complementarity, calling into question the generality of earlier findings. However, differences among study systems in which short-and long-term studies are conducted currently limit our ability to assess whether these differences are simply due to biological or environmental differences among systems. In this paper, we compared the effect of intertidal seaweed species richness on biomass accumulation in mesocosms and field experiments using the same pool of species. We found that seaweed species richness increased biomass accumulation in field experiments in both short (2-month) and long (3-year) experiments, although effects were stronger in the long-term experiment. In contrast, richness had no effect in mesocosm experiments, where biomass accumulation was completely a function of species identity. We argue that the short-term experiments, like many published experiments on the topic, detect only a subset of possible mechanisms that operate in the field over the longer term because they lack sufficient environmental heterogeneity to allow expression of niche differences, and they are of insufficient length to capture population-level responses, such as recruitment. Many published experiments, therefore, likely underestimate the strength of diversity on ecosystem processes in natural ecosystems.","2008",NA,"10.1073/pnas.0806425105","WOS:000261489100043"

In model Douglas-fir ecosystems maintained for five growing seasons, elevated temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2) increased photosynthesis and increased C storage belowground but not aboveground. We hypothesized that interactions between N cycling and C fluxes through two main groups of microbes, mycorrhizal fungi (symbiotic with plants) and saprotrophic fungi (free-living), mediated ecosystem C storage. To quantify proportions of mycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi, we measured stable isotopes in fungivorous microarthropods that efficiently censused the fungal community. Fungivorous microarthropods consumed on average 35% mycorrhizal fungi and 65% saprotrophic fungi. Elevated temperature decreased C flux through mycorrhizal fungi by 7%, whereas elevated CO2 increased it by 4%. The dietary proportion of mycorrhizal fungi correlated across treatments with total plant biomass (n = 4, r(2) = 0.96, P = 0.021), but not with root biomass. This suggests that belowground allocation increased with increasing plant biomass, but that mycorrhizal fungi were stronger sinks for recent photosynthate than roots. Low N content of needles (0.8-1.1 %) and A horizon soil (0.11 %) coupled with high C: N ratios of A horizon soil (25-26) and litter (36-48) indicated severe N limitation. Elevated temperature treatments increased the saprotrophic decomposition of litter and lowered litter C: N ratios. Because of low N availability of this litter, its decomposition presumably increased N immobilization belowground, thereby restricting soil N availability for both mycorrhizal fungi and plant growth. Although increased photosynthesis with elevated CO2 increased allocation of C to ectomycorrhizal fungi, it did not benefit plant N status. Most N for plants and soil storage was derived from litter decomposition. N sequestration by mycorrhizal fungi and limited N release during litter decomposition by saprotrophic fungi restricted N supply to plants, thereby constraining plant growth response to the different treatments.","2007",NA,"10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01379.x","WOS:000248945800008"

Both aerobic and anaerobic treatment methods followed by storage effectively reduced the levels of total solids (59 to 68%), biological oxygen demand (85 to 90%), and sulfate (56 to 65%), as well as aerobic (83 to 95%), anaerobic (80 to 90%), and coliform (> 99%) bacteria. However, only aerobic treatment reduced the levels of ammonia, and anaerobic treatment was more effective at reducing total sulfur and sulfate. The bacterial population structure of waste before and after treatment was monitored using 16S rRNA gene sequence libraries. Both treatments had unique effects on the bacterial population structure of waste. Aerobic treatment resulted in the greatest change in the type of bacteria present, with the levels of eight out of nine phyla being significantly altered. The most notable differences were the > 16-fold increase in the phylum Proteobacteria and the approximately 8-fold decrease in the phylum Firmicutes. Anaerobic treatment resulted in fewer alterations, but significant decreases in the phyla Actinobacteria and Baeteroidetes, and increases in the phyla Planctomycetes, Spirochetes, and TM7 were observed.","2007",NA,"10.1128/AEM.01422-06","WOS:000243394400021"

Temperature fluctuation is a general phenomenon affecting many, if not all, species in nature. While a few studies have shown that temperature fluctuation can promote species coexistence, little is known about the effects of different regimes of temperature fluctuation on coexistence. 2. We experimentally investigated how temperature fluctuation and different regimes of temperature fluctuation ('red' environments in which temperature series exhibited positive temporal autocorrelation vs. 'white' environments in which temperature series showed little autocorrelation) affected the coexistence of two ciliated protists, Colpidium striatum Stein and Paramecium tetraurelia Sonneborn, which competed for bacterial resources. 3. We have previously shown that the two species differed in their growth responses to changes in temperature and in their resource utilization patterns. The two species were not always able to coexist at constant temperatures (22, 24, 26, 28 and 30 degrees C), with Paramecium being competitively excluded at 26 and 28 degrees C. This indicated that resource partitioning was insufficient to maintain coexistence at these temperatures. 4. Here we show that in both red and white environments in which temperature varied between 22 and 32 degrees C, Paramecium coexisted with Colpidium. Consistent with the differential effects of temperature on their intrinsic growth rates, Paramecium population dynamics were largely unaffected by temperature regimes, and Colpidium showed more variable population dynamics in the red environments. 5. Temperature-dependent competitive effects of Colpidium on Paramecium, together with resource partitioning, appeared to be responsible for the coexistence in the white environments; resource partitioning and the storage effect appeared to account for the coexistence in the red environments. 6. These results suggest that temperature fluctuation may play important roles in regulating species coexistence and diversity in ecological communities.","2007",NA,"10.1111/j.1365-2656.2007.01252.x","WOS:000247398800004"

Using an experimental system of bacteriophage-mediated competition in bacterial populations and a deterministic model, we have shown in Joo et al. [Proc. R. Soc. B 273,1843-1848 (2006)] that the competitive advantage conferred by the phage depends only on the relative phage pathology and is independent of the initial phage concentration and other phage and host parameters such as the infection-causing contact rate, the spontaneous and infection-induced lysis rates, and the phage burst size. Here we investigate the effects of stochastic fluctuations on bacterial invasion facilitated by bacteriophage, and examine the validity of the deterministic approach. We use both numerical and analytical methods of stochastic processes to identify the source of noise and assess its magnitude. We show that the conclusions obtained from the deterministic model are robust against stochastic fluctuations, yet deviations become prominently large when the phage are more pathological to the invading bacterial strain.","2007",NA,"10.1007/s10955-006-9182-z","WOS:000247428200013"
"Nelson, WA; McCauley, E; Nisbet, RM","Stage-structured cycles generate strong fitness-equalizing mechanisms","EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY","For many organisms, rates of reproduction, growth and mortality depend on the amount of resources that an individual consumes. When resource abundances fluctuate through space and time, the realized life-history of an individual can change dramatically depending on the dynamics experienced. Previous studies have investigated the influence of resource-dependent rates on population dynamics, but none have considered how the feedback between non-equilibrium resource dynamics and resource-dependent life-histories influence natural selection and the maintenance of genetic diversity within populations. Here we demonstrate that different patterns of resource dynamics have a strong impact on natural selection in organisms with resource-dependent life-histories. Small-amplitude consumer-resource cycles, lead to lower rates of natural selection than do large-amplitude consumer-resource cycles. Parameterizing the model for a Daphnia-algal system, we demonstrate that resource-dependent life-history can explain the recently published observation that selection among Daphnia genotypes changed depending on the pattern of algal resource fluctuations. The characteristically asexual reproduction of Daphnia allows us to draw a much-needed link to the large body of competition theory that has emerged from community ecology. Our results reveal that the common ecological features of resource-dependent life-history and ontogenetic size-structure generate strong fitness equalizing mechanisms that likely contribute to the maintenance of diversity in natural systems.","2007",NA,"10.1007/s10682-006-9131-y","WOS:000247638700005"
"Jorgensen, P; Ibarra-Obando, SE; Carriquiry, JD","Top-down and bottom-up stabilizing mechanisms in eelgrass meadows differentially affected by coastal upwelling","MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES","Trophic cascades usually regulate structure and dynamics of valuable benthic vegetation communities (e.g. kelp forests, salt marshes), resulting in alternating high and low abundances from predators at the highest level, down through herbivores, to basal producers at the lowest trophic level. While herbivores may have direct strong negative effects on kelp and salt marsh vegetation, grazing invertebrates (mesograzers) within seagrass meadows consume and thus control the biomass of opportunistic epiphyte algae that can outcompete seagrasses for light. Small fish predators, however, may control mesograzer abundances, thus releasing epiphytes from grazing pressure, with resultant widespread losses of seagrasses under eutrophic conditions. In order to assess whether trophic cascades operate in seagrass systems, we compared patterns of abundance and composition of the benthic vegetation community, the associated epifaunal invertebrates, and their predators in eelgrass meadows distributed across a natural gradient of algal productivity. Within this gradient we selected and sampled in summer and winter 3 eelgrass meadows differentially affected by strong coastal upwelling. High mesograzer abundance repeatedly coincided with low epiphyte biomass, emphasizing top-down control of epiphytes, despite high nutrient availability, Consumption of live eelgrass tissue by mesograzers was potentially important at the lower end of the productivity gradient. Alternating patterns of abundances between successive trophic levels under intermediate and high productivity conditions suggest that small predator abundances may ultimately govern the success of eelgrass in eutrophic meadows. When pipefish were abundant and eelgrass complexity was low, patterns were consistent with a destabilizing trophic cascade. Evidence supporting a trophic cascade dynamic from small fish through to epiphytes may indicate susceptibility of eelgrass systems to higher order interactions.","2007",NA,"10.3354/meps333081","WOS:000245557100008"

Microbial biomass carbon (MBC), BIOLOG profiles of soil microbes and soil enzyme activities were measured. Under monoculture, elevated Pb did not reduce soil MBC, had no effects on activities of urease, acid phosphatase and dehydrogenase, but stimulated the activity of alkaline phosphatase. Compared to monoculture, plant species coexistence did not significantly affect soil microbial biomass C but increased microbial functional group diversity index and urease activity under different Pb concentrations. In addition, microbial community structure diverged among plant coexistence treatments under each Pb concentration.

It forms one explanation of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) for local communities specifically that diversity should be maximized at intermediate disturbance frequencies, yet only a fraction of empirical studies support IDH predictions. Similarly, this trade-off is also a powerful explanation of coexistence at larger spatial scales. I show, with a microbial experimental system, that the diversity - disturbance relationship is dependent on the relative distribution of species along this trade-off. Here I show that, when species are skewed toward late-successional habits, local diversity declines with disturbance. Yet, despite this trait skew, diversity at scales larger than the patch appears insensitive to the trade-off distribution. Intermediate disturbance frequencies produce the greatest diversity in patch successional stage, thus benefiting the maximum number of species at larger scales.","2007",NA,"10.1890/06-1117","WOS:000246104600003"

The indirect mutualism between the B biotype whitefly and these viruses via their host plants, and the apparent lack of such mutualism for the indigenous whitefly, may contribute to the ability of the B whitefly biotype to invade, the displacement of indigenous whiteflies, and the disease pandemics of the viruses associated with this vector.","2007",NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0000182","WOS:000207444200006"

We report the results of a microcosm experiment where similarity in habitat use among aquatic snail species was evaluated as a predictor of changes in community and ecosystem properties due to increasing species richness. Replicate microcosms with all possible one- and two-species combinations of a guild of six snail species were stocked with identical initial snail biomass. Microcosms with two species of snails had greater final snail biomass, lower attached algae biomass, and less total organic matter than monocultures. Snail species differed in their use of five distinct habitat types in the microcosms. Similarity in habitat use between a species pair was negatively related to the magnitude of change (e.g., AEF [change in ecosystem function]) in dissolved oxygen, periphyton biomass, and accrual of organic matter with a change in diversity. However, using the most stringent criterion for complementarity effects (e.g., D-max [proportional deviation of the total polyculture yield from the highest yielding monoculture]), a relationship between species' niche similarity and changes in function with increasing species richness was only observed for dissolved oxygen. The identity of snail species present in the microcosms had strong effects on total organic matter, snail biomass, dissolved oxygen, periphyton biomass, and sedimentation rate. In this study, herbivore identity, sampling effects, and niche complementarity all appear to contribute to species richness effects on pond ecosystem properties and community structure. The analytical approach employed here may profitably be used in other systems to quantify the role of niche complementarity in species richness-ecosystem function relationships.","2007",NA,"10.1890/06-0651.1","WOS:000248620500025"
"Bevins, SN","Timing of resource input and larval competition between invasive and native container-inhabiting mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae)","JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY","Container-inhabiting mosquito species are subject to both intraspecific and interspecific competition during larval development in resource -limited habitats. The arrival of an invasive species, Aedes albopictus, in the US. has altered competitive interactions among container-inhabiting mosquito species and, in some cases, has led to displacement of these species. Resource enrichment of container habitats has been shown to alleviate competitive interactions and to promote species co-existence; however, the importance of the timing of enrichment has yet to be explored. Larval competition between Ae. albopictus and a native species, Ochlerotatus triseriatus, was explored when resources were added either gradually or in a single pulse. Replacement series experiments revealed that Ae. albopictus was able to outcompete and displace Oc. triseriatus via resource monopolization when all resources were made available simultaneously; however, when the same resource amount was added over time, survival was high for both species, leading to co-existence. Timing of resource input also had an effect in monospecific treatments, indicating that intraspecific competition impacts survival as well. Duration of larval development was influenced by both species presence and by timing of resource input for Oc. triseriatus. These results indicate competitive outcome is condition-specific and that timing of resource input can determine whether a dominant invasive competitor displaces a native species, or if the two species are able to co-exist. Both intraspecific and interspecific competition occur at different temporal scales due to species-specific differences in larval developmental time. Timing of resource availability in container habitats can impact mosquito survival via competitive interactions, which can ultimately influence vector population size and behavior, possibly influencing vector-borne disease transmission.","2007",NA,"10.3376/1081-1710(2007)32[252:TORIAL]2.0.CO;2","WOS:000252478300014"

Plant-soil feedbacks occur when plants change soil community composition such that interactions with that soil community in turn may positively or negatively affect the performance of conspecifics. Theories predict and studies show that invasions may be promoted by stronger negative soil feedbacks for native compared with exotic species. We present a counter-example of a successful invader with strong negative soil feedbacks apparently caused by host-specific, pathogenic soil fungi. Using a feedback experiment in pots, we investigated whether the relative strength of plant-soil feedbacks experienced by a non-native woody invader, Sapium sebiferum, differed from several native tree species by examining their performance in soils collected near conspecifics ('home soils') or heterospecifics ('away soils') in the introduced range. Sapium seedlings, but no native seedlings, had lower survival and biomass in its home soils compared with soils of other species ('negative feedback'). To investigate biotic agents potentially responsible for the observed negative feedbacks, we conducted two additional experiments designed to eliminate different soil taxa ('rescue experiments'). We found that soil sterilization (pot experiment) or soil fungicide applications (pot and field experiments) restored Sapium performance in home soil thereby eliminating the negative feedbacks we observed in the original experiment. Such negative feedbacks apparently mediated by soil fungi could have important effects on persistence of this invader by limiting Sapium seedling success in Sapium dominated forests ( home soils) though their weak effects in heterospecific (away) soils suggest a weak role in limiting initial establishment.","2007",NA,"10.1098/rspb.2007.0804","WOS:000249421700015"

The systems analysis of complex metabolic networks allows us to ask how such information translates into fitness. A metabolic network transforms nutrients into biomass. The better it uses information on available nutrient availability, the faster it will allow a cell to divide. Results: I here use metabolic flux balance analysis to show that the accuracy I (in bits) with which a yeast cell can sense a limiting nutrient's availability relates logarithmically to fitness as indicated by biomass yield and cell division rate. For microbes like yeast, natural selection can resolve fitness differences of genetic variants smaller than 10-6, meaning that cells would need to estimate nutrient concentrations to very high accuracy (greater than 22 bits) to ensure optimal growth. I argue that such accuracies are not achievable in practice. Natural selection may thus face fundamental limitations in maximizing the information processing capacity of cells.

Utilization of the light spectrum can be interpreted in terms of classical niche theory, as the light spectrum offers opportunities for niche differentiation and allows coexistence of species absorbing different colors of light. However, which spectral niches are available for phototrophic microorganisms? Here, we show that the answer is hidden in the vibrations of the water molecule. Water molecules absorb light at specific wavebands that match the energy required for their stretching and bending vibrations. Although light absorption at these specific wavelengths appears only as subtle shoulders in the absorption spectrum of pure water, these subtle shoulders create large gaps in the underwater light spectrum due to the exponential nature of light attenuation. Model calculations show that the wavebands between these gaps define a series of distinct niches in the underwater light spectrum. Strikingly, these distinct spectral niches match the light absorption spectra of the major photosynthetic pigments on our planet. This suggests that vibrations of the water molecule have played a major role in the ecology and evolution of phototrophic microorganisms.","2007",NA,"10.1038/ismej.2007.59","WOS:000249216300002"

Isolates co-occurred in a larch plantation (Larix sp.) or were from adjacent habitats. Of the 21 isolates (nine spp.) tested on potential prime carbon sources, none could utilise common plant structural polymers. Conidiobolus adiaeretus, C. iuxtagenitus, and B. ranarum from litter and some soil isolates of C. heterosporus, C. pumilus, and C. firmipilleus could use starches and glycogen. In marked contrast, all could utilise animal chitin, gelatine, casein, N-acetyl glucosamine, and trehalose. The lipids tributyrin and sunflower oil also supported growth. Conidia on cadavers usually led to high levels of colonisation as was the case for 30 isolates (ten species). Collembola were more frequently and rapidly colonised than mites. Cadavers of many other arthropods were also internally colonised. The ability to utilise cadavers of diverse arthropods indicates that trophic competition between co-occurring test species may be minimal. Niche differentiation may depend more on non-trophic features of their life history. Negative correlation of performance with the presence of naturally occurring, non-test fungi suggests competition with (or antibiosis from) at least some of the other fungi. In washed or unwashed plant fragments of larch litter (F-layer) only occasional local growth and resting spore formation occurred. Extra nutrients did not facilitate colonisation.

In baker's yeast, the ferroxidase-permease complex transports Fe(ll) produced by reductases. We investigated transcript abundances of these genes as a function of Fe quota (Q(Fe)). Ferric reductase transcripts are abundant in both species (15%-60% of actin) under low Q(Fe) and are down-regulated by 5- to 35-fold at high Q(Fe), suggesting Fe(III) reduction is a common, inducible strategy for Fe acquisition in marine diatoms. Permease transcript abundance was regulated by Fe status in T. pseudonana, but we did not detect significant differences in expression of the copper (Cu)-containing ferroxidase.

The up-regulation of genes in T. pseudonana that appear to be missing altogether from P. tricornutum as well as the finding that P. tricornutum seems to have an efficient system to acquire Fe', suggest that diverse (and uncharacterized) Fe-uptake systems may be at play within diatom assemblages. Different uptake systems among diatoms may provide a mechanistic basis for niche differentiation with respect to Fe availability in the ocean.","2007",NA,"10.1111/j.1529-8817.2007.00359.x","WOS:000248544800010"
"Warren, CR; Adams, PR","Uptake of nitrate, ammonium and glycine by plants of Tasmanian wet eucalypt forests","TREE PHYSIOLOGY","A central assumption of ecosystem N cycling has been that organic N must be converted to inorganic N to be available for plant uptake, but this has been questioned by recent studies. We examined uptake of nitrate, ammonium and the amino acid glycine in three species from Eucalyptus obliqua L'Her. wet forest in Tasmania, south-eastern Australia, to test the hypothesis that all three species can take up glycine, and to compare rates of glycine uptake with rates of uptake of nitrate and ammonium uptake. The alternative hypothesis that species vary in their preference for nitrate, ammonium and glycine (niche differentiation) was also examined. Measurements were made on the canopy dominant Eucalyptus obliqua, and two rain forest tree species found in the understory or as sub-dominants of the canopy, Nothofagus cunninghainii (Hook.) Oerst. and Phyllocladus aspleniifolius (Labill.) Hook.f. Nitrogen uptake was examined in situ with attached roots placed in uptake solutions containing equimolar concentrations (100 mu mol L-1) of N-15-nitrate, N-15-ammonium and 2-C-13(2) N-15-glycine. Species did not differ in their preference for different forms of N (species x N form interaction, P > 0.05), and thus there was no evidence of niche differentiation. In all species, rates of uptake were highest for ammonium (11 +/- 5 mu mol g(DM)(-1) h(-1); mean +/- SD, n = 108), uptake of glycine occurred at less than half this rate (4.4 +/- 2.6 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)), DM whereas uptake of nitrate occurred at one-tenth of this rate (0.9 1.2 pmol g(DM)(-1) h(-1)). The strong positive relationship between N-15 and C-13 Uptake indicated that at least 72% of glycine-N was taken up intact. These findings indicate the potential for considerable uptake of organic N in the field.","2007",NA,"10.1093/treephys/27.3.413","WOS:000245066500010"

Many biogeochemical processes are accompanied by changes in the ratio between stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen (C-12/C-13 and N-14/N-15), which allows different ecosystem components and different ecosystems to be distinguished by their isotopic composition. Analysis of isotopic composition makes it possible to trace matter and energy flows through biological systems and to evaluate the rate of many ecological processes. The main concepts and methods of stable isotope ecology and patterns of stable isotope fractionation during organic matter decomposition are considered with special emphasis on the fractionation of isotopes in food chains and the use of stable isotope studies of trophic relationships between soil animals in the field.","2007",NA,"10.1134/S1062359007040127","WOS:000248326000012"

Recent laboratory experiments showed that partitioning of white light allows stable coexistence of red and green picocyanobacteria. Here, we investigate to what extent these laboratory findings can be extrapolated to natural waters. We predict from a parameterized competition model that the underwater light colour of lakes and seas provides ample opportunities for coexistence of red and green phytoplankton species. To test this prediction, we sampled picocyanobacteria of 70 aquatic ecosystems, ranging from clear blue oceans to turbid brown peat lakes. As predicted, red picocyanobacteria dominated in clear waters, whereas green picocyanobacteria dominated in turbid waters. We found widespread coexistence of red and green picocyanobacteria in waters of intermediate turbidity. These field data support the hypothesis that niche differentiation along the light spectrum promotes phytoplankton biodiversity, thus providing a colourful solution to the paradox of the plankton.","2007",NA,"10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01026.x","WOS:000244883700005"

At a site dominated by invasive Dreissena mussels, only E. ischnus was present; however, at sites with rich filamentous or macrocolonial green algal communities, either both amphipods co-existed or only G. fasciatus was present. A strong correlation existed between G. fasciatus relative abundance and filamentous and macrocolonial green algal relative abundance. G. fasciatus appears to be better equipped to inhabit filamentous algae, whereas E. ischnus seems better adapted for areas dominated by Dreissena spp..

The relationship between species richness and body size is one of the most thoroughly studied subjects in animal ecology; however, this relationship and its underlying mechanisms are largely unknown in photosynthetic organisms, especially protists. 2. In this continental study, I first examined the number of diatom species across the cell size spectrum in benthic and planktonic stream habitats. The relationship was right-skewed unimodal and was significantly different between the benthos and the plankton; larger sizes were more speciose in the benthos, and smaller sizes in the plankton. The species richness peaks were explained with allometric trade-offs between maximum nutrient uptake rate and dispersal in the benthos but maximum nutrient uptake rate and sinking resistance in the phytoplankton. 3. I also explored the cell size similarity among species and across environments. Small diatoms were significantly more similar in size than large diatoms, and benthic diatoms were significantly more similar than planktonic diatoms. 4. This is the first continental study on the richness-body size relationship in algae, which suggests that the environmental differences between benthic and planktonic habitats generated allometric trade-offs that have driven the cell size optimization towards larger species in the benthos but smaller in the plankton. The patterns of cell size similarity revealed a higher niche overlap in the benthos than in the phytoplankton and among small species than among large species. These findings indicate that interspecific competition in stream diatoms, which is a function of niche differentiation, is habitat-specific and inversely related to cell size.","2007",NA,"10.1111/j.1365-2745.2007.01248.x","WOS:000247320100017"

We characterized and compared the three-dimensional architecture of the ecologically important cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus in a near-native state using cryo-electron tomography and found that closely related strains have diverged substantially in cellular organization and structure. By visualizing native, hydrated structures within cells, we discovered that the MED4 strain, which possesses one of the smallest genomes (1.66 Mbp) of any known photosynthetic organism, has evolved a comparatively streamlined cellular architecture. This strain possesses a smaller cell volume, an attenuated cell wall, and less extensive intracytoplasmic (photosynthetic) membrane system compared to the more deeply branched MIT9313 strain. Comparative genomic analyses indicate that differences have evolved in key structural genes, including those encoding enzymes involved in cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Although both strains possess carboxysomes that are polygonal and cluster in the central cytoplasm, the carboxysomes of MED4 are smaller. A streamlined cellular structure could be advantageous to microorganisms thriving in the low-nutrient conditions characteristic of large regions of the open ocean and thus have consequences for ecological niche differentiation. Through cryo-electron tomography we visualized, for the first time, the three-dimensional structure of the extensive network of photosynthetic lamellae within Prochlorococcus and the potential pathways for intracellular and intermembrane movement of molecules. Comparative information on the near-native structure of microorganisms is an important and necessary component of exploring microbial diversity and understanding its consequences for function and ecology.","2007",NA,"10.1128/JB.01948-06","WOS:000247231700018"

We measured the natural variation in stable isotope ratios (N-15/N-14, C-13/C-12) in oribatid mites from the bark of oak (Quercus robur), beech (Fagus sylvatica), spruce (Picea abies) and pine (Pinus sylvestris) trees and their potential food sources, i.e., the covering vegetation of the bark (bryophytes, lichens, algae, fungi). As a baseline for calibration the stable isotope signatures of the bark of the four tree species were measured and set to zero. Oribatid mite stable isotope ratios spanned over a range of about 13 delta units for N-15 and about 7 delta units for C-13 suggesting that they span over about three trophic levels. DiVerent stable isotope signatures indicate that bark living oribatid mites feed on different food sources, i.e., occupy distinct trophic niches. After calibration stable isotope signatures of respective oribatid mite species of the four tree species were similar indicating close association of oribatid mites with the corticolous cover as food source. Overall, the results support the hypothesis that trophic niche diVerentiation of bark living oribatid mites contributes to the high diversity of the group.","2007",NA,"10.1007/s10493-007-9060-7","WOS:000244951500001"

Methods and Results: Samples have been taken the year around from sections of the wetland filled with different substrata. When present, the root zones of the helophyte Phragmites australis were also sampled. The diversity of the ammonia- oxidizing community was established by a coupled PCR DGGE method based on the 16s rRNA gene. Averaged over the seasons, no large differences in community composition were observed between the different substrata, although the section with zeolite always showed the highest frequencies of bands belonging to ammonia- oxidizing bacteria of the beta- subclass of the Proteobacteria. Only sequences related to the Nitrosospira lineage were detected. Averaged again over the seasons, the section with zeolite was also most constant with respect to the potential ammonia- oxidizing activity. Conclusions: Although the ammonia- oxidizing communities did not differ significantly between the different sections of the constructed wetland, the characteristics of zeolite were most appropriate to accommodate a stable and active community of ammonia- oxidizing bacteria. The presence of the helophyte had no effect on the diversity and stability of the ammonia- oxidizing community. Significance and Impact of the Study: It has been shown that substrata used in constructed wetlands made no distinction between ammonia- oxidizing strains in relation to attachment. However, zeolite had the best performance with respect to activity over the seasons.","2007",NA,"10.1111/j.1365-2672.2007.03357.x","WOS:000250263400010"

From the population genetics perspective, we clarify the confusion and correct the inconsistency in the definition of relative fitness in the literature of HIV-1 viral fitness. The LFR and LRF are easier to estimate from the experimental data than the PRR, which was misleadingly defined as the relative fitness in recent HIV-1 research literature.

The main risk factors for its development are hepatitis B and C virus infection, alcoholism and aflatoxin intake. If acquistion of risk factors is not prevented and cirrhosis is established, the sole option to improve survival is to detect the tumor at an early stage when effective therapy may be indicated. Early detection plans should be based on hepatic ultrasonography every 6 months, whereas determination of tumor markers is not efficient. Upon detection of a hepatic nodule, there is a need to establish unequivocal diagnosis, either through biopsy or through the application of non-invasive criteria based on the specific radiology appearance of the tumor: fast arterial uptake of contrast followed by venous washout. Effective treatment for liver cancer includes surgical resection, liver transplantation and percutaneous ablation. These options provide a high rate of complete responses and are assumed to improve survival that should exceed 50% at 5 years. If the tumor is diagnosed at an advanced stage, the sole option that improves survival is transarterial chemoembolization.

The reduction of external nutrient loads often does not result in a change back to the macrophyte-dominated state because stabilising mechanisms that cause resilience may delay a response. Additional internal lake restoration measures may therefore be needed to decrease the concentration of total phosphorus and increase water clarity. The re-establishment of submerged macrophytes required for a long-term stability of clear water conditions, however, may still fail, or mass developments of tall-growing species may cause nuisance for recreational use. Both cases are often not taken into account when restoration measures are planned in Germany, and existing schemes to reduce eutrophication consider the topic inadequately. Here we develop a step-by-step guideline to assess the chances of submerged macrophyte re-establishment in shallow lakes. We reviewed and rated the existing literature and case studies with special regard on (1) the impact of different internal lake restoration methods on the development of submerged macrophytes, (2) methods for the assessment of natural re-establishment, (3) requirements and methods for artificial support of submerged macrophyte development and (4) management options of macrophyte species diversity and abundance in Germany.

Seasonal differences in biomass consumption were compared between both species in those items considered as key resources according to biomass consumption. Strawberry tree fruits can be considered as key resource exclusively for genets whereas fungi, blackberries and rabbits are keys for stone martens only. For other key resources consumed by both species (wood mouse and figs) we suggest that a possible mechanism to reduce diet overlap could be the sequential use of these resources: no intensive exploitation by both species of the same key resource during the same season was detected. Figs and wood mouse were used alternatively. Although strawberry tree fruits and blackberry are exclusive key resources of one of the species, their consumptions showed the same pattern.

We assembled all possible food webs including one or more of the ciliate species and cross-classified them with four levels of enrichment of the bacterial medium. The qualitative outcome of food web interactions was independent of enrichment and always the same: Tetrahjrmena strongly depressed or excluded Colpidium, and Blepharisma strongly depressed or excluded both bacterivores. Consequently, in all sub-webs only the dominant ciliate species responded positively to enrichment. The total density of bacteria increased with enrichment irrespective of food web composition. In contrast, the response of singlecelled bacteria to enrichment depended on food web composition and was only weakly positive in most food webs with the omnivore. Enrichment had a positive effect on the relative success of (presumably more defended) bacterial aggregates. The outcome of interspecific interactions among ciliates could not be predicted from monoculture experiments and deviated from earlier experiments in which each bacterivore coexisted separately with the omnivore. As a potential explanation we suggest that changes in experimental protocol reduced spatial heterogeneity and increased attack rates. A simple, dynamical model shows that increased attack rates can indeed greatly decrease the upper limit and range of enrichment over which intermediate consumers can coexist with omnivores.","2006",NA,"10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.14516.x","WOS:000239563300003"

Across all pairs of tree genera, we found a strong negative correlation between the pairwise similarity of assemblages and genetic distances of hosts. This close correlation is due to deep differences in the composition of assemblages on coniferous and deciduous tree genera. Range, niche and habitat overlap were always of much less importance than genetic distance to explain the variation of pairwise similarity of assemblages of exploiters, although some correlations were significant. Therefore in general host switches of exploiters between related hosts are more important that host switches between hosts co-occurring in the same habitat. We found a robust relationship of the pairwise similarity of assemblages of insects and the pairwise similarity of assemblages of fungi which points to the possibility that insects are vectors for parasitic fungi which promotes correlated switches of insects and fungi.","2006",NA,"10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.14418.x","WOS:000237655400011"

A multivariate approach (RLQ analysis coupled with a revised version of 4(th)-corner analysis) identified distinct diet patterns among co-occurring grazers. These patterns were mainly explained by differential ingestion of diatoms that differed in their spatial positions within the multilayered periphyton mat. When the size range of available diatoms was large, diet differences were partly explained by diatom size. Comparison of diatoms in grazer guts with diatoms available in the environment indicated selective feeding in different levels of the periphyton mat by grazers. Some grazers (scrapers) fed preferentially on tightly attached diatoms, whereas others (surfers) favored overstory diatoms. Spatial segregation of feeding within the periphyton mat by members of the grazer guild was more evident in a period of potential resource limitation (July) than when food was abundant (May). Our results suggest that all layers/growth forms in the diatom mat are used, resulting in spatial partitioning of the resource when considering the entire grazer community.

UK losses of Euro56M per season are estimated using national disease survey data and a yield loss formula. Phoma stem canker pathogen populations comprise two main species, Leptosphaeria maculans, associated with damaging stem base cankers, and Leptosphaeria biglobosa, often associated with less damaging upper stem lesions. Both major gene and quantitative trait loci mediated resistance to L. maculans have been identified in B. napus, but little is known about resistance to L. biglobosa. Leptosphaeria maculans, which has spread into areas in North America and eastern Europe where only L. biglobosa was previously identified, now poses a threat to large areas of oilseed rape production in Asia. Epidemics are initiated by air-borne ascospores; major gene resistance to initial infection by L. maculans operates in the leaf lamina of B. napus.

"Reinhart, KO; Callaway, RM","Soil biota and invasive plants","NEW PHYTOLOGIST","Interactions between plants and soil biota resist invasion by some nonnative plants and facilitate others. In this review, we organize research and ideas about the role of soil biota as drivers of invasion by nonnative plants and how soil biota may fit into hypotheses proposed for invasive success. For example, some invasive species benefit from being introduced into regions of the world where they encounter fewer soil-borne enemies than in their native ranges. Other invasives encounter novel but strong soil mutualists which enhance their invasive success. Leaving below-ground natural enemies behind or encountering strong mutualists can enhance invasions, but indigenous enemies in soils or the absence of key soil mutualists can help native communities resist invasions. Furthermore, inhibitory and beneficial effects of soil biota on plants can accelerate or decelerate over time depending on the net effect of accumulating pathogenic and mutualistic soil organisms. These 'feedback' relationships may alter plant-soil biota interactions in ways that may facilitate invasion and inhibit re-establishment by native species. Although soil biota affect nonnative plant invasions in many different ways, research on the topic is broadening our understanding of why invasive plants can be so astoundingly successful and expanding our perspectives on the drivers of natural community organization.","2006",NA,"10.1111/j.1469-8137.2006.01715.x","WOS:000236738600005"

We investigated whether AMF improved the ability of old field perennials to grow on a range of phosphorus sources and whether AMF facilitated differential performance of plant species on different phosphorus sources (phosphorus niche partitioning). We manipulated form of phosphorus (control versus different inorganic and organic sources) and AM fungal species (control versus four individual AMF species or an AMF community) for five old field perennials grown in a greenhouse in individual culture. Based on biomass after four months of growth, we found no evidence for phosphorus niche partitioning. Rather, we found that effects of AMF varied from parasitic to mutualistic depending on plant species, AMF species, and phosphorus source (significant Plant x Fungus x Phosphorus interaction). Our results suggest that the degree of AMF benefit to a plant host depends not only on AMF species, plant species, and soil phosphorus availability (as has also been found in other work), but can also depend on the form of soil phosphorus. Thus, the position of any AMF species along the mutualism to parasitism continuum may be a complex function of local conditions, and this has implications for understanding plant competitive balance in the field.","2006",NA,"10.1007/s00442-005-0270-6","WOS:000235271600017"

The mycophagous drosophilids, their fungal food resources and parasitoids were studied by carrying out an intensive census throughout the activity seasons of 4 years (2000-2003) in Hokkaido, northern Japan. Five hymenopterous parasitoid species, four braconids and one eucoilid, were found. Parasitoids of mycophagous drosophilids are reported for the first time from Asia. Most parasitism (99.2%) was by braconids, in contrast to the dominance of eucoilids in Europe. Parasitism was restricted to the summer, and the rate was high from early July to early August every year. There was considerable yearly variation in the composition of abundant fungus, drosophilid and parasitoid species, especially between 2000 and 2001. The alternation of dominant host species was coupled with the alternation of dominant parasitoid species that differed in host use. Despite the yearly variation in the system, the most dominant host species suffered disproportionately heavy parasitism by the correspondingly dominant parasitoid species every year. The parasitism rate was positively correlated with the relative host abundance. This thus indicates that the disproportionate parasitism mechanism may operate, via which species coexistence is promoted by a higher rate of parasitism of the dominant species.","2006",NA,"10.1111/j.1479-8298.2006.00149.x","WOS:000236535700003"

They also have different efficiencies in gathering phosphate from the soil. These differences in phosphate uptake and ERM length or architecture may contribute to differential growth responses of plants and this may be an important contributor to plant species coexistence. The effects of the development of the ERM of AMF on the coexistence of two co-occurring plant species were investigated in root-free hyphal chambers in a rhizobox experimental unit. The dominant shrub (Salix atrocinerea Brot.) and herbaceous (Conyza bilbaoana J. Remy) plant species found in a highly alkaline anthropogenic sediment were studied in symbiosis with four native AMF species ( Glomus intraradices BEG163, Glomus mosseae BEG198, Glomus geosporum BEG199 and Glomus claroideum BEG210) that were the most abundant members of the AMF community found in the sediment. Different AMF species did not influence total plant productivity (sum of the biomass of C. bilbaoana and S. atrocinerea), but had a great impact on the individual biomass of each plant species. The AMF species with greater extracted ERM lengths (G. mosseae BEG198, G. claroideum BEG210 and the four mixed AMF) preferentially benefited the plant species with a high mycorrhizal dependency (C. bilbaoana), while the AMF species with the smallest ERM length (G. geosporum BEG199) benefited the plant species with a low mycorrhizal dependency (S. atrocinerea). Seed production of C. bilbaoana was only observed in plants inoculated with G. mosseae BEG198, G. claroideum BEG210 or the mixture of the four AMF. Our results show that AMF play an important role in the reproduction of C. bilbaoana coexisting with S. atrocinerea in the alkaline sediment and have the potential to stimulate or completely inhibit seed production. The community composition of native AMF and the length of the mycelium they produce spreading from roots into the surrounding soil can be determinant of the coexistence of naturally co-occurring plant species.","2006",NA,"10.1007/s11104-006-9067-6","WOS:000241892500020"

Fitness for replication could be a determinant of the likelihood of dissemination of resistant viruses. We assessed the fitness of two PZ-resistant viruses (F212 and MP4). F212 grew less well in cell culture than the parent A2 virus and was predicted to be less fit than A2. Equal amounts of F212 and A2 were mixed and passaged in cell culture. F212 disappeared from the viral population, indicating it was less fit than the A2 virus. The MP4 virus grew as well as A2 in culture and in cotton rats. A2/MP4 virus input ratios of 1:1, 10:1, 100:1, and 1,000:1 were compared in competitive replication. For all input ratios except 1,000:1, the MP4 virus became dominant, supplanting the A2 virus. The MP4 virus also dominated the A2 virus during growth in cotton rats. Thus, the mutant MP4 virus was more fit than A2 virus in both in vitro and in vivo competitive replication. Whether this fitness difference was due to the identified nucleotide substitutions in the F gene or to mutations elsewhere in the genome is unknown.

The niche differences result from small differences in their biology/epidemiology, leading to separation in space, time, or resource use. Changes in both natural (e.g., fluctuating temperature) and manmade (e.g., agronomic practices, pollution) factors influence the coexistence. Such factors may result in coexistence between the related species in some parts of the world, whereas in other parts only one species occurs.

We determined ECM anatomotypes, recorded the abundance of corresponding ECM root tips and classified them into groups of ECM exploration types, which refer to the organisation and the extent of their extramatrical mycelia. The abundance of ECM was highest in the organic soil layers, compared to the mineral soil horizon. The ordination of the ECM communities and of the exploration types revealed segregation related to soil horizon properties. While Cenococcum geophilum preferred the organic soil layers, Lactarius spp., Tomentella spp. and Craterellus tubaeformis were generally most abundant in the mineral soil horizons. Cenococcum geophilum was the predominant species, possibly based on enhanced competitiveness under the prevailing site conditions. The short-distance exploration types (e.g. C. geophilum) preferentially colonised the organic soil layer, whereas the contact types (e.g. most of the Tomentella spp., C. tubaeformis) together with medium-distance types (e.g. Amphinema byssoides) were primarily associated with the underlying A-horizons. Therefore, the soil horizons had an important effect on the distribution of ECM and on their community structure.

A positive relationship has been found between species richness and primary production in many experiments, and there is now an increasing interest whether similar relationships also apply to microorganisms and decomposition. Basidiomycete fungi are the primary decomposers of wood with the functional groups brown and white rot fungi, which differ with respect to decay strategy. In this study, 16 species of boreal wood decay fungi, 8 brown rot fungi and 8 white rot fungi, were assembled in artificial communities. The aims were to study species persistence, wood decomposition and metabolic efficiency in fungal communities of increasing levels of species richness under constant and fluctuating temperature regimes. Species persistence was generally low, but temperature fluctuations facilitated co-existence of species. Decomposition was highest at intermediate diversity levels under the fluctuating temperature regime. Metabolic efficiency, estimated as the amount of fungal mycelium formed per amount of degraded wood, decreased with increasing community complexity under the fluctuating temperature regime. Brown and white rot fungi differed in decomposition rates and metabolic efficiency, but no synergistic effects were found where the two functional groups were mixed. This study demonstrates how niche differentiation in a variable environment may act to maintain diversity and function. In our experiment, differences in functional responses to the varying temperature rather than resource partitioning between brown and white rot fungi had significant effects. Niche differentiation is likely to be particularly important in maintaining species diversity in communities of wood decaying fungi, which are known from previous studies to be characterised by intense competition, and where otherwise metabolically costly interactions lead to species exclusion and dominance by highly competitive species.","2006",NA,"10.1007/s00442-006-0406-3","WOS:000238533400009"

Here we show, for a wide range of prokaryotic communities, that the relative abundance and frequency with which different taxa are observed in samples can be explained by a neutral community model (NCM). The NCM, which is a stochastic, birth death immigration process, does not explicitly represent the deterministic factors and therefore cannot be a complete or literal description of community assembly.

Metabolic profiles obtained from potential denitrification rates with 10 electron donors showed that the denitrifying communities altered their preferences for certain compounds after supplementation with methanol or ethanol and that methanol had the greater impact. Clone libraries of nirK and nirS genes, encoding the two different nitrite reductases in denitrifiers, revealed that methanol also increased the diversity of denitrifiers of the nirS type, which indicates that denitrifiers favored by methanol were on the rise in the community. This suggests that there might be a niche differentiation between nirS and nirK genotypes during activated sludge processes. The composition of nirS genotypes also varied greatly among all samples, whereas the nirK communities were more stable. The latter was confirmed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of nirK communities on all sampling occasions.

"Fox, JW; Barreto, C","Surprising competitive coexistence in a classic model system","COMMUNITY ECOLOGY","Competing species often coexist, but the mechanisms allowing long-term coexistence are rarely tested via direct experimental manipulation. We experimentally tested the mechanisms of coexistence in a classic model system, laboratory microcosms in which two species of ciliate protists competed for bacteria. Previous work shows that the species used here compete for bacteria, but can coexist despite large differences in grazing ability. We tested three hypotheses that might explain this surprising coexistence: resource partitioning, chemically-mediated interference competition, and differential use of space. To test for resource partitioning, we conducted an experiment testing the effects of bacterial species richness and composition on the long-term outcome of competition. Manipulating bacterial diversity and composition alters the scope for resource partitioning. Despite strong evidence for differential resource use (e.g., the two ciliates shifted bacterial species composition in different ways), initial bacterial richness and composition did not affect the long-term outcome of competition. Remarkably, the competitive outcome was unchanged even when ciliates competed for a single bacterial species, indicating that the observed resource partitioning is irrelevant to the competitive outcome. In further experiments, we ruled out differential space use and chemically-mediated interference competition as explanations for this surprising coexistence. Coexistence of ciliates on a single bacterial species might reflect partitioning of intraspecific bacterial diversity, and/or osmotrophy or consumption of particulate detritus by the weaker competitor. The results show that this classic model system is not as well-understood as had been previously thought.

One problem with short-term, experimental studies is that complex interactions between species in natural systems may alter the importance of underlying mechanisms over time thus making the effects observed in the experiments representative of a transient phase. Although some evidence indicates that initial effects of species richness observed in short-term experiments may be persistent, other results suggest that effects may change over time. Using detritivorous insect larvae in freshwater mesocosms, where both facilitation and niche differentiation mechanisms were operating and where resources were gradually decreasing, I examined the effects of species richness over time. I found that the initial effect of species richness on ecosystem function was enhanced over time when systems of high and low diversity were compared. There was an overall effect of species composition on larval growth, and when analysing the growth of each species separately it was found that one species was significantly affected by species richness, one showed a marginally insignificant effect of species richness, and the third species was significantly, differently affected by species richness over time. Thus, the results show that species loss initially leading to small, negative, or even undetectable, effects on ecosystem function may increase in importance over the long-term.

Navicula phyllepta Kutzing is a brackish-marine morpho-species with a cosmopolitan distribution. Axenic clones of this species were isolated from natural assemblages of benthic diatoms at different intertidal stations in the Westerschelde estuary (The Netherlands). At least two distinct semicryptic species of N. phyllepta were present, as shown by differences in the quantity of DNA per cell, the ITS1 sequences and the copy number of ITS per cell. DNA and chl a concentrations extracted from sediment surface samples were closely correlated, showing that the DNA used for subsequent analysis mostly belonged to the microalgal community. The results of real-time qPCR from sites throughout the estuary and over several seasons agreed well with microscopic counts. Additionally, the seasonal pattern of the two forms of N. phyllepta showed an overlapping, but unique distribution along the estuary.","2006",NA,"10.1111/j.1529-8817.2006.00268.x","WOS:000240662400018"

However, this technique has not been harmonized among different laboratories. In this experiment, the changes of the CLPPs after storage of three Mediterranean forest soils were characterised for two sampling depths. The methods to store the samples were cooling, freezing and room temperature storage. Data presented in this study provide evidence that substantial changes can occur to the soil microbial community functions, regardless of the kind of storage. Changes in functional diversity and substrate evenness depended on the profile and sampling depth. The rate of consumption of the groups of substrates, however, shifted towards an enhanced utilisation of carboxylic acids, phenols and/or amines after 1 month storage at 4 C, regardless of the profile or sampling depth. This was attributed to the physical disruption of soil aggregates and exposure of relatively recalcitrant occluded organic matter. These effects levelled out during 1-year storage. The great sensitivity of CLPPs to storage treatment suggests to take care for immediate analysis after sampling. In case fresh samples are not available, freezing is recommended as a convenient alternative; in that case, however, the kinetic approach is required for data analysis. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The abundance of mycorrhiza was uniformly high near trees, declined rapidly around 15 m from the base of trees and was uniformly low at 20 m. All seedlings between 0 and 8 m distance from forest edges were ectomycorrhizal, but many seedlings at 16-20 m were uninfected in one of the two years of the study. Species richness of fungi also declined with distance from trees. 4 Different species of fungi were found at different distances from the edge. 'Rare' species (found only once or twice) dominated the community at 0 m, Russula spp. were dominants from 4 to 12 m, and Astraeus sp. and a Pezizalean fungus were abundant at 12 m to 20 m. Cenococcum geophilum, the most dominant species found, was abundant both near trees and distant from trees, with lowest relative abundance at intermediate distances. 5 Our data suggest that seedlings germinating at some distance from established ectomycorrhizal vegetation (15.5 m in the present study) have low levels of infection, at least in the first year of growth. Distance from established vegetation represents an important gradient for ectomycorrhizal fungi, with different species occupying distinct niches along this gradient. This provides support for niche differentiation as a factor contributing to ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity. 6 Ectomycorrhizal infection of seedlings is spatially complex, with high infection and high fungal diversity near trees, high infection but lower diversity at intermediate distances, and low infection and low fungal diversity distant from trees. This spatial complexity should be considered as a factor potentially influencing the establishment of ectomycorrhizal vegetation.","2005",NA,"10.1111/j.1365-2745.2005.00977.x","WOS:000227721400002"

Strains were isolated from different locations along a microclimatic gradient at 'Evolution Canyon' (EC), Mt Carmel, Israel. Selected were 17 strains from the canyon's 'African' south-facing slope (SFS), characterized by xeric conditions and high irradiation, 19 from the 'European' north-facing slope (NFS), characterized by mesic conditions and low irradiation, and six strains from the valley bottom. We wished to test a hypothesis assuming that S. cerevisiae strains found in EC locations characterized by either high or low intrinsic stress, such as light, temperature, UV light, and/or a radical oxygen burden, might be confined to niches due to genetic differences reflected in their transcript profiles. Survival and recovery for three different stresses, NaCl, H2O2, and mannitol, was tested. H2O2-sensitive strains included the laboratory strain S150-2B and most strains from the NFS. A correlation between peroxide tolerance, the SFS, and sunny niches within slopes was statistically supported. Salinity tolerance segregated with peroxide tolerance in most strains. Analysis using a S. cerevisiae genome array and hierarchical clustering of regulated transcripts indicated maximum linkage of expression profiles between strains that showed the same phenotypic stress response. In addition to genes for functionally unknown open reading frames, genes commonly up-regulated in tolerant strains in response to H2O2, but not up-regulated in sensitive strains, were related to protein synthesis, cell wall biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism, and amino acid biosynthesis. In contrast, genes induced only in sensitive strains identified oxidative stress-related functions, sugar permeases, heat-shock proteins, and genes for functions in oxidative phosphorylation.

"de Boer, W; Folman, LB; Summerbell, RC; Boddy, L","Living in a fungal world: impact of fungi on soil bacterial niche development","FEMS MICROBIOLOGY REVIEWS","The colonization of land by plants appears to have coincided with the appearance of mycorrhiza-like fungi. Over evolutionary time, fungi have maintained their prominent role in the formation of mycorrhizal associations. In addition, however, they have been able to occupy other terrestrial niches of which the decomposition of recalcitrant organic matter is perhaps the most remarkable. This implies that, in contrast to that of aquatic organic matter decomposition, bacteria have not been able to monopolize decomposition processes in terrestrial ecosystems. The emergence of fungi in terrestrial ecosystems must have had a strong impact on the evolution of terrestrial bacteria. On the one hand, potential decomposition niches, e.g. lignin degradation, have been lost for bacteria, whereas on the other hand the presence of fungi has itself created new bacterial niches. Confrontation between bacteria and fungi is ongoing, and from studying contemporary interactions, we can learn about the impact that fungi presently have, and have had in the past, on the ecology and evolution of terrestrial bacteria. In the first part of this review, the focus is on niche differentiation between soil bacteria and fungi involved in the decomposition of plant-derived organic matter. Bacteria and fungi are seen to compete for simple plant-derived substrates and have developed antagonistic strategies. For more recalcitrant organic substrates, e.g. cellulose and lignin, both competitive and mutualistic strategies appear to have evolved. In the second part of the review, bacterial niches with respect to the utilization of fungal-derived substrates are considered. Here, several lines of development can be recognized, ranging from mutualistic exudate-consuming bacteria that are associated with fungal surfaces to endosymbiotic and mycophagous bacteria. In some cases, there are indications of fungal specific selection in fungus-associated bacteria, and possible mechanisms for such selection are discussed.

Depox(R), a newly developed compound, consisting of Fe(III) and NO3-, has a storage effect for NO3-. NO3- is released slowly, hence the disadvantageous high solubility of NO3- in water can be retarded. The compound was added to water as a suspension which quickly flocculated and precipitated. Within 3 weeks, NO3- was desorbed from the Depox(R) compound in deionized water. After application in lakes, the NO3- availability on the sediment surface was prolonged for 2 months. After treatment, P release from the sediment and microbial metabolism were investigated under laboratory conditions as well as in the mesocosm. P release was almost stopped in both cases during the experiment. SO42- consumption was significantly lower after Depox(R) addition, and CH4 production was completely suppressed by Depox(R) treatment in the laboratory, whereas in the enclosures SO42- and also CH4 concentrations at the sediment water interface did not change significantly between treated enclosures and controls.

Since invasion signalling pathways are coordinated by the balance between protein kinases and phosphatases, we investigated the effect of conditioned medium from bacteria on the overall cellular tyrosine phosphorylation. Methods: The tyrosine phosphorylation level of HCT-8/E11 human colon cancer cells treated with the pro-invasive conditioned medium of Listeria, prepared on top of collagen type I gels (CM(Coll)Listeria/TSB), were analysed by means of immunoprecipitation and Western blot, with specific anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies.

CM(Coll)Listeria/TSB-stimulated ErbB3 tyrosine phosphorylation and cancer cell invasion were independent from EGFR expression and activity but dependent on ErbB2 activity.

However, this stabilizing mechanism has rarely been tested, and was recently rejected as an explanation for maintaining diversity in natural populations of the freshwater herbivore Daphnia pulex(3). The primary limitation of competition theory is its failure to account for the alternative types of population cycles that are caused by size- or stage-dependent population vital rates - even though such structure both explains the fluctuating dynamics of many species(4) and may alter the outcome of competition(5). Here we provide the first experimental test of whether alternative types of cycles affect natural selection in predator - prey systems. Using competing Daphnia genotypes, we show that internally generated, stage-structured cycles substantially reduce the magnitude of selection ( thereby contributing to the maintenance of genetic diversity), whereas externally forced cycles show rapid competitive exclusion. The change in selection is ecologically significant, spanning the observed range in natural populations(3). We argue that structured cycles reduce selection through a combination of stalled juvenile development and stage-specific mortality. This potentially general fitness-equalizing mechanism may reduce the need for strong stabilizing mechanisms to explain the maintenance of genetic diversity in natural systems.","2005",NA,"10.1038/nature03212","WOS:000226546200042"

We tested this hypothesis with Drosophila subobscura Collin (Diptera: Drosophilidae) by manipulating their nutritional (yeast-fed vs. non-yeast-fed) and reproductive status (mated vs. non-mated). Flies were then released into vials containing decaying fruits (either sloes, crab apples, or Syrian plums). After a constant residence time in the vials, the flies were removed, 16 first-instar larvae were transferred to the fruits and their survival probability to the adult stage was recorded. Whereas previous exposure of the larval substrate to yeast-fed males and virgin females (yeast-fed and non-yeast-fed) had no effect on survivorship, exposure to yeast-fed and mated females that deposited eggs on the fruits (subsequently removed) led to a significant increase in the survival probability of the transferred larvae to the adult stage. Although the exact mechanism of yeast transmission remains to be determined, we suggest an active inoculation of the breeding substrates with yeast by ovipositing females. In agreement with previous studies, we found a negative effect of mould growth on larval survival, which, however, depended on the fruit type. We discuss various scenarios of yeast involvement in benefits to the insect larvae and suggest that insect-mould interactions should be examined in detail in order to better understand the behavioural and life-history traits of insects that depend on ephemeral resources.","2005",NA,"10.1111/j.1570-7458.2005.00334.x","WOS:000231799000005"

Using mathematical models we examine what role these fungi can play in determining the competitive outcome between two plants in competition for one mineral resource. Depending on different relationships between the benefit accrued to the plant and the fungi, the presence of mycorrhizal fungi can (i) have no impact on which plant wins in competition, (ii) change the order of competitive dominance or (iii) enable coexistence when compared with the system in the absence of mycorrhizal fungi. Furthermore, environmental conditions, such as light and nutrient levels, can determine if coexistence is possible.

We used an experimental microbial landscape to determine whether dispersal occurring at two different scales - among local communities and among metacommunities - affects diversity differently. At the local scale, dispersal initially had a positive effect and subsequently a neutral effect on diversity, whereas at the metacommunity and landscape scales, dispersal showed a consistently negative effect. The timing in which dispersal affected beta diversity also differed sharply between local communities and metacommunities. These patterns were explained by scale- and time-dependent effects of dispersal in allowing spread of species and in removing spatial refuges from predators. Our results suggest that the relative contribution of opposing mechanisms by which dispersal affects diversity changes considerably over time and space in hierarchical landscapes in which dispersal occurs at multiple scales.","2005",NA,"10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00750.x","WOS:000228397000011"

The extensive loss of species-rich grasslands in Europe as a result of agricultural intensification has triggered a desire to recreate more diverse and natural grassland systems in set-aside fields. Appropriate management and species introductions are necessary to overcome residual soil fertility, lack of suitable plant propagules and dominance of undesirable invasive species. 2. A field experiment was performed in a boreal former hayfield to test the effect of turf inoculation, mowing (twice annually) and spring burning. We surveyed changes in plant diversity, composition and productivity over a 3-year period. Signature fatty acids and soil respiration measurements were employed to survey changes in the soil community. 3. Few changes in the vegetation and soil communities could be related to inoculation of turf monoliths. Most of the measured variables in mown plots differed from the set-aside (control) plots, while burned plots displayed mainly similar responses. Mowing increased plant species richness and diversity, mainly by enhancing the number and frequency of forb species. Small-statured forb species were promoted by mowing, whereas tall leafy grasses declined. Effects of mowing on soil communities comprised an increased soil respiration and stimulation of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. 4. Synthesis and applications. The results demonstrate the importance of reducing sward height in order to promote plant species coexistence in former boreal hayfields. In such systems, eliminating accumulated litter by spring burning has little influence on species composition when the sward is allowed to grow tall. Mowing is therefore the most efficient way of enhancing biodiversity. The results also show that mowing-mediated changes in above-ground plant communities may stimulate below-ground symbiotic micro-organisms, potentially resulting in a positive feedback on ecosystem development.","2005",NA,"10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01023.x","WOS:000228396600016"

Fungal inoculation shifted coexistence ratios. When Tamarix and Populus were grown together, Tamarix plants averaged 20 of pot biomass in the uninoculated control but only 5 of pot biomass in the inoculated treatment.

Recovery of a freshwater red alga following disturbance at the patch scale","AUSTRAL ECOLOGY","Disturbance is an important factor in species coexistence. Disturbance models require knowledge about whether disturbed patches must be colonized anew from dispersal or whether species left behind can dominate, hence altering recovery trajectories of patches. The red, filamentous alga Audouinella hermannii Roth is a common macroalgal species present at sites in the Steavenson River, a stony, upland stream in south-eastern Australia. We conducted an experiment in which we contrasted the recovery trajectory of the alga on overturned rocks compared with those that were not overturned, and for rocks that had remnants of the alga left behind compared with others where the alga was scrubbed off completely. Rocks had either a rough or smooth texture. Experimental rocks were set out in riffles and algal recovery monitored in 8 x 8 cm quadrats at approximately 4-6 weekly intervals for 8 months. We found that overturning caused a lasting impact on A. hermannii cover, whereas rocks that were abraded by scrubbing recovered very quickly, suggesting that this alga can re-grow quickly from fragments (a result confirmed by a second experiment). Both surface texture and resident algae affected recovery on abraded substrata. Quadrats surrounded by resident algae on rough-textured rocks had lower algal cover compared with all other treatments. We hypothesize this effect is caused by higher densities and grazing intensities of herbivorous macroinvertebrates on those sorts of substrata, analogous to findings for marine habitats. Abrasion does not kill A. hermannii, whereas overturning likely does, necessitating new colonization. Floods often create a mix of abrasion and overturning, producing a mosaic of patches, the complexity of which is not represented well by measures of average disturbance intensity over a whole site. The use of the latter may explain some recent contradictory results among stream disturbance studies. A patch-level perspective is needed when disturbance creates mosaics over the landscape.","2005",NA,"10.1111/j.1442-9993.2005.01467.x","WOS:000230600700005"

Fundamental to fluctuation dependent mechanisms of coexistence are differential species' responses to environmental fluctuations through time. The covariance between the environment and competition this generates leads to compensatory population dynamics, now thought to be important for community stability. We tested this theory experimentally using freshwater diatoms. We measured the growth of Cyclotella pseudostelligera and Fragilaria crotonensis over a range of temperatures. Cyclotella showed a higher growth rate and higher silicate assimilation rate between 6 degrees C and 18 degrees C, while Fragilaria showed greater competitive ability above 18 degrees C. These results were used to parameterize a resource competition model. Numerical simulation of this model predicted stable coexistence and compensatory dynamics under fluctuating but not constant temperature.

Since current efforts aiming at the restoration of floodplain grasslands through the transfer of plant material from species-rich source stands may lead to the establishment of initially small populations consisting of founders from different populations, the present paper experimentally investigated the effects of pollen source and floral types (i.e. chasmogamous (CH) and cleistogamous (CL) flowers) on seed traits and offspring performance in three highly endangered violet species (Viola elatior, V. pumila, V. stagnina) of these grasslands. We estimated inbreeding depression and tested the performance of selfed and outcrossed offspring in two microbial environments, i.e. in soil inoculated with (i) non-sterile substrate from the same species ('home'-conditions) and (ii) sterilised substrate. Plants produced more CL capsules than CH flowers. Pollinator exclusion had only small effects on CH seed production. CL seeds had a significantly lower mass per seed than CH seeds. This may be related to constraints in allocation or environmental conditions. Seedling growth was reduced in plants grown under 'home'-conditions as compared to control soils. Under 'home'-conditions, relative fitness of selfed seedlings of V. stagnina was significantly higher than that of crossed progeny. Our results suggest that high genetic differentiation among populations as a consequence of isolation may result in outbreeding depression, e.g., through biochemical or physiological incompatibilities between genes or the breaking of coadapted gene complexes. In V. stagnina, offspring fitness differed considerably between environments, but in general we found no indications for inbreeding depression in these rare species.

"Schneider, K; Maraun, M","Feeding preferences among dark pigmented fungal taxa (Dematiacea) indicate limited trophic niche differentiation of oribatid mites (Oribatida, Acari)","PEDOBIOLOGIA","Trophic niche differentiation may explain the high diversity of soil animal species. However, trophic niches of soil invertebrate species are little understood and it appears that different decomposer soil animal species prefer similar food substrates. Soil microarthropods, such as collembolans and oribatid mites, preferentially feed on dark pigmented fungi (Dematiacea) but their feeding preferences among different dark pigmented fungal species are little studied. In this study, we offered eight dark pigmented fungal taxa (Alternaria alternata, Bipolaris spicifera, Chloridium sp., Cladosporium sp., Codinea sp., Oidiodendron sp., Phialophora verrucosa, Ulocladium sp.) and two little pigmented fungal species (Aureobasidium pullulans and Mortierella romanniana) to 10 species of oribatid mites. Despite the overall trend of oribatid mites to prefer two of the dark pigmented fungi (Alternaria alternata and Ulocladium sp.), feeding preferences significantly differed between the oribatid mite species. Achipteria coleoptrata, Carabodes sp., Liacarus subterraneus, Oribatella quadricornuta and Steganacarus magnus strongly preferred Alternaria alternato and Ulocladium sp.; Hypochthonius rufulus preferred Phialophora verrucosa. Species with Low feeding preferences, Eupelops torulosus and Oribatula tibialis, preferentially fed on Ulocladium sp. and Codinea sp., respectively. The other species (Nothrus silvestris, Platynothrus peltifer) had no clear feeding preferences. The results support that trophic niche differentiation in oribatid mite species is limited, but may contribute to the high diversity of soil animal species. (C) 2004 Elsevier GmbH.

The microcosms had been filled with the upper 5 cm of intertidal freshwater sediment from the river Scheldt. Changes in community composition were examined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of amplified DNA from the community. In the first week of incubation the initially present members of the Nitrosomonas oligotropha lineage were replaced by other members of the same lineage in the top layer of the sediment subjected to flooding with freshwater. Prolonged incubation extended niche differentiation to a depth of 5 cm. In the microcosms flooded with saline media, the initially present members of the N. oligotropha lineage were replaced by strains belonging to the Nitrosomonas marina lineage, but only in the top I cm. Shift in community composition occurred earlier in the marine microcosms than in the brackish microcosms and was slower than the change in the freshwater microcosms. Irrespective of the nature of the flooding medium, shifts in community composition were always consistent among replicate microcosms. We conclude that salinity is an important steering factor in niche differentiation among ammonia-oxidi sing bacteria and also that changes within the community of this functional group of bacteria may occur at different rates.

The main aim of this study was to explore the importance of partitioning of food resources for the high diversity of micro-arthropods in soil. In addition, we investigated if ectomycorrhizal fungi are preferentially consumed compared to saprotrophic fungi. Until today, ectomycorrhizal fungi have never been tested as potential food resource for oribatid mites. We offered six ectomycorrhizal fungi [Amanita muscaria (L.) Hook., Boletus badius (Fr.)

The ericoid mycorrhizal fungus H. ericae and the ectomycorrhizal fungus B. badius were preferentially consumed by each oribatid mite species.

"Steiner, CF","Impacts of density-independent mortality and productivity on the strength and outcome of competition","ECOLOGY","Nonselective, density-independent mortality (DIM) is commonly thought to reduce the importance of competition, promoting coexistence of ecologically similar species. Yet, recent theory suggests that competition intensity and niche differences remain important under high DIM, even when competitive dominance is modified. Productivity is also thought to interact with DIM, potentially enhancing species coexistence. I explored these issues using a laboratory system composed of a diverse assemblage of bacteria as prey, and four species of competing protozoan bacterivores. Productivity manipulations were crossed with varying levels of DIM imposed on the bacterivores (in both polyculture and monoculture). DIM altered patterns of competitive dominance. At low DIM, Paramecium aurelia and Paramecium caudatum dominated, while Colpoda inflata (a species absent at low DIM) was able to invade and dominate at high DIM. Productivity did not promote shifts in dominance and hindered Colpoda performance. Examination of competition effect sizes provided clear evidence of competitive reversals and the importance of competition under low and high DIM. Variable competitive outcomes appeared to be mediated by changes in the strength of apparent competition effects on bacterial diversity, in accordance with theory. Bacterial diversity was low at low levels of DIM, due to strong consumer effects. High DIM weakened consumer effects and increased bacterial diversity, likely facilitating invasion and coexistence.","2005",NA,"10.1890/04-0508","WOS:000227659700022"

The substrates were inoculated with five common species of soil fungi in all possible combinations (from monocultures to five species in combination). In both substrates, the rate of organic matter decomposition was positively associated with species richness. The effect of fungal diversity was much stronger in the uniform single-resource substrate (r(2) = 0.455, P < 0.0001) than in soil (r(2) = 0.154, P < 0.0001). The results document that species richness of microbial decomposers strongly affects decomposition processes, at least at the species poor end of the diversity gradient. Both, 'sampling effect' and 'species complementarity effect' contributed to the community response with the latter being much more pronounced in uniform substrate than in soil. This indicates that facilitative interactions are more important than resource partitioning for positive effects of species richness.","2005",NA,"10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00757.x","WOS:000229389500006"

Age-related resistance is important for both of these pathogens. The facultative saprophyte Pyrenophora was generally a stronger competitor than the biotrophic Puccinia, even experiencing facilitation from the presence of Puccinia when Pyrenophora had the advantage of earlier inoculation. Both pathogen species produced the most spores when they were introduced before the competing species and more spores when introduced simultaneously compared to after the competitor. The pre-interactive niche of Puccinia was larger than the post-interactive niche and sporulation by Puccinia was substantially reduced in environments in which Pyrenophora had high sporulation rates. The pre-interactive niche of Pyrenophora was similar to the post-interactive niche and Pyrenophora had proportionally lower reductions in sporulation due to interspecific competition in the pre-interactive niche.","2005",NA,"10.1007/s00442-004-1814-x","WOS:000228517300013"

In particular, the detritivores are regarded as food generalists. We have investigated nitrogen stable isotope ratios (N-15/N-14) of a major decomposer group, the Collembola, to evaluate trophic relationship and determine feeding guilds. Additionally, the delta(15)N values of potential food sources such as mosses, lichens and other plant derived material (bark, nuts, leaves) were analysed. The natural variation in nitrogen isotopes was assessed in 20 Collembola taxa from three deciduous forest stands. The delta(15)N signature formed a continuum from phycophages/herbivores to primary and secondary decomposers, reflecting a gradual shift from more detrital to more microbial diets. The delta(15)N gradient spanned over 9 delta units, which implies a wide range in food sources used. Assuming a shift in N-15 of about 3 parts per thousand per trophic level, the results indicate a range of three trophic levels. These variations in 15 NI 14 N ratios suggest that trophic niches of Collembola species differ and this likely contributes to Collembola species diversity. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Classical plating methods were applied to cultivate these fungi and to study their morphology. Molecular markers were used for further determination. The nuclear ribosomal large subunit and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer of DNA extracts of the cultured fungi as well as total DNA extracts of the mites themselves, also containing fungal DNA, were amplified and sequenced. Based on phylogenetic analysis, a total of 31 fungal species from major fungal groups were found to be associated with oribatid mites, indicating that mites do not selectively disperse specific species or species groups. The detected taxa were mainly saprobiontic, cosmopolitan (e.g., Alternaria tenuissima), but also parasitic fungi (Beauveria bassiana) for whose dispersal oribatid mites might play an important role. In contrast, no mycorrhizal fungi were detected in association with oribatid mites, indicating that their propagules are dispersed in a different way. In addition, fungi that are known to be a preferred food for oribatid mites such as the Dematiacea were not detected in high numbers. Results of this study point to the potential of oribatid mites to disperse fungal taxa in soil and indicate that co-evolutionary patterns between oribatid mites and their associated fungi might be rare or even missing in most cases, since we only detected ubiquitous taxa attached to the mites.","2005",NA,"10.1007/s00248-005-5017-8","WOS:000234194900005"

I used Dynamic Linear Models to examine effects of fluctuations in temperature and five algal groups on population dynamics of two rotifer species over a 33-yr period in which climate has warmed, anthropogenic nutrient loading has changed dramatically, and Daphnia has become established. Dynamics of the colonial rotifers Conochilus hippocrepis and Conochilus unicornis were both best predicted by temperature and the density of single-celled bacterio- and phytoplankton smaller than 10 mu m, but their seasonal peaks have become dramatically offset toward fall and spring, respectively, in recent years. Both species have been extirpated from the summer months in which they once flourished, seemingly because of midsummer declines in their food resources, which have been depressed by Daphnia since its establishment. However, climate warming has increased the length of the plankton growing season in Lake Washington, such that spring and fall offer greater abundance of food resources for Conochilus, offsetting modern exclusion of Conochilus from midsummer months. Additionally, greater distinction in temporal niches presumably has reduced possibilities for intrageneric competition, and both Conochilus species have achieved higher mean annual abundances in recent years.","2005",NA,"10.4319/lo.2005.50.2.0421","WOS:000227835200003"

One hundred and fourteen taxa, the highest number of taxa ever recorded during a survey of phragmiticolous fungi, were found, with 56 taxa (49%) in the ascomycetes, 6 taxa (5%) in the basidiomycetes and 52 taxa (46%) of anamorphic fungi, the latter comprising 30 (26%) coelomycetes and 22 (19%) hyphomycetes. Fungal diversity in tidal marshes compared is lower than that in non-tidal reed marshes. Species distribution on reed litter, investigated by multivariate analysis, was strongly correlated with flooding frequency and salinity. Influences of salinity on the fungal community are discussed and tested by a culture experiment. Taxa were divided into three basic distributional types: taxa present only in the saline-brackish water zone, species present only in the freshwater zone, and a group of eurytopic species found over the entire salinity gradient sampled. Indicator species for each group were determined. In two sites, mesolialine brackish and freshwater, the vertical distribution of mycota was analysed. Higher similarities between the same vertical zones, especially in middle and apical parts of the culms, indicated that terrestrial fungi (no direct contact with tidal exchange water) were less influenced by site-specific characteristics. However, in both sites, a few common indicator species for standing Phragmites culms could be identified. Flooding height (and frequency) is demonstrated to influence vertical species distribution. Generally rather complicated interactions and a narrow niche differentiation among species are revealed for the phragmiticolous fungal community.","2005",NA,"10.1127/0029-5035/2005/0080-0173","WOS:000227726900009"

Ciid beetles typically live and breed in the fruiting bodies of lignicolous basidiomycete fungi. This study was undertaken to address the lack of an objective examination of patterns of host use by ciids. 2. Cluster analysis of ciid host-use datasets from Britain, Germany, North America, and Japan, and subsequent cross-dataset comparisons, demonstrated the existence of ciid host-use patterns of wide geographical occurrence. These patterns were formalised as ciid host-use groups. 3. Six Holarctic ciid host-use groups, and two host-use subgroups, were identified, and are described. Each host-use group comprises an assemblage of fungal genera and the breeding ciids that it supports. Each taxon belongs to only a single host-use group, but may be associated with several members of that group. There is a strong tendency for closely related taxa to belong to the same host-use group. 4. It is suggested that ciid host-use groups are defined ultimately by host chemistry, with the ciids that belong to a particular group recognising, and responding positively to, emitted volatiles characterising the fungi belonging to that group. 5. The idea of the host-use group bears comparison with the concepts of niche and guild, but is not equivalent to either. 6.

Phylogenetic differentiation (identification) of heterotrophic bacteria was performed by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, and FISH probes were designed to determine the community structure and the spatial organization (i.e., niche differentiation) in the biofilm. FISH analysis showed that this autotrophic nitrifying biofilm was composed of 50% nitrifying bacteria (ammonia-oxidizing bacteria [AOB] and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria [NOB]) and 50% heterotrophic bacteria, and the distribution was as follows: members of the alpha subclass of the class Proteobacteria (alpha-Proteobacteria), 23%; gamma-Proteobacteria, 13%; green nonsulfur bacteria (GNSB), 9%; Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides (CFB) division, 2%; and unidentified (organisms that could not be hybridized with any probe except EUB338), 3%. These results indicated that a pair of nitrifiers (AOB and NOB) supported a heterotrophic bacterium via production of soluble microbial products (SMP). MAR-FISH revealed that the heterotrophic bacterial community was composed of bacteria that were phylogenetically and metabolically diverse and to some extent metabolically redundant, which ensured the stability of the ecosystem as a biofilm. alpha- and gamma-Proteobacteria dominated the utilization of [C-14]acetic acid and C-14-amino acids in this biofilm. Despite their low abundance (ca. 2%) in the biofilm community, members of the CFB cluster accounted for the largest fraction (ca. 64%) of the bacterial community consuming N-acetyl-D-[1-C-14] glucosamine (NAG). The GNSB accounted for 9% of the C-14-amino acid-consuming bacteria and 27% of the [C-14]NAG-consuming bacteria but did not utilize [C-14]acetic acid. Bacteria classified in the unidentified group accounted for 6% of the total heterotrophic bacteria and could utilize all organic substrates, including NAG. This showed that there was an efficient food web (carbon metabolism) in the autotrophic nitrifying biofilm community, which ensured maximum utilization of SMP produced by nitrifiers and prevented buildup of metabolites or waste materials of nitrifiers to significant levels.","2004",NA,"10.1128/AEM.70.3.1641-1650.2004","WOS:000220154800049"

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can be a useful tool to study the microbial community structures associated with these particles, and thus their ecological significance, yet an appropriate protocol for processing deep-sea particle-rich water samples is lacking. Some sample processing considerations are discussed in the present study, and different combinations of existing procedures for preservation, size fractionation sequential filtration, and sonication were tested in conjunction with FISH. Results from this study show that water samples should be filtered and processed within no more than 10 to 12 h after collection, or else preservation is necessary. The commonly used prefiltration formaldehyde fixation was shown to be inadequate for the rRNA targeted by FISH. However, prefiltration formaldehyde fixation followed by immediate freezing and postfiltration paraformaldehyde fixation yielded highly consistent cell abundance estimates even after 96 days or potentially longer storage. Size fractionation sequential filtration and sonication together enhanced cell abundance estimates by severalfold. Size fractionation sequential filtration effectively separated particle-associated microbial communities from their free-living counterparts, while sonication detached cells from particles or aggregates for more-accurate cell counting using epifluorescence microscopy. Optimization in sonication time is recommended for different specific types of samples.

In particular, we investigate the management program designed to eradicate the English cordgrass, Spartina anglica C. E. Hubbard, in marine intertidal habitats of Puget Sound, Washington, United States. Observational and manipulative experiments were used to measure the regrowth (vegetative growth), reinvasion (seedling recruitment), and restoration potential (return to native condition) of invaded habitats. Removal regime (consistent: yearly removal; interrupted: yearly removal with the last year missed) and habitat type (low salinity marsh, mudflat, cobble beach, and high salinity marsh sites) were considered. The response to removal regime was dramatic. Under consistent removal, cordgrass slowly declined but under interrupted removal, there was substantial regrowth of the invader. This pattern results from the resiliency of belowground biomass and the subsequent high aboveground productivity and seedling growth of S. anglica. We also found that removal success depended on differences among sites that represent different habitat types. Cordgrass regrowth and reinvasion were substantially higher in the low salinity marsh sites where soils have lower salinity. We also found that at the low salinity marsh sites, some restoration of native plants and soil conditions was evident. At mudflat, cobble beach, and high salinity marsh sites, colonization of native vascular plants and algae not normally present in the absence of the invasion, occurred. Whether these habitats will eventually revert back to the pre-invasion conditions over a longer period of time is unknown.","2004",NA,"10.1007/BF02803381","WOS:000221826300008"

A large decrease in the concentration of free amino groups was observed in the first 24 h and between 7 and 14 days of storage in the case of yogurt made with the two starters indicating that microorganisms continue to grow in low temperatures. During the fermentation and the storage of both yogurt types, alpha-lactalbumin was hydrolyzed to a slightly greater extent than beta-lactoglobulin. During fermentation and the storage, beta-casein was degraded slightly than alpha(S1)- + alpha(S2)-caseins. Generally, a more intense heat pretreatment led to greater degradation of whey proteins and caseins during fermentation and storage. Differences in proteolytic activity between the two starters used (proteins degraded more by ABT-3 than by YC-183) may lead to the improvement in production and formulation of yogurts differing in their physico-chemical and rheological properties.","2004",NA,"10.1111/j.1745-4514.2004.tb00075.x","WOS:000224968400005"

Shallow lake ecosystems are normally dominated by submerged and emergent plants. Biological stabilising mechanisms help preserve this dominance. The systems may switch to dominance by phytoplankton, however, with loss of submerged plants. This process usually takes place against a background of increasing nutrient loadings but also requires additional switch mechanisms, which damage the plants or interfere with their stabilising mechanisms. 2. The extent to which the details or even major features of this general model may change with geographical location are not clear. Manipulation of the fish community (biomanipulation) has often been used to clear the water of algae and restore the aquatic plants in northerly locations, but it is again not clear whether this is equally appropriate at lower latitudes. 3. Eleven parallel experiments (collectively the International Mesocosm Experiment, IME) were carried out in six lakes in Finland, Sweden, England, the Netherlands and Spain in 1998 and 1999 to investigate the between-year and large-scale spatial variation in relationships between nutrient loading and zooplanktivorous fish on submerged plant and plankton communities in shallow lakes. 4. Comparability of experiments in different locations was achieved to a high degree. Cross-laboratory comparisons of chemical analyses revealed some systematic differences between laboratories. These are unlikely to lead to major misinterpretations. 5. Nutrient addition, overall, had its greatest effect on water chemistry then substantial effects on phytoplankton and zooplankton. Fish addition had its major effect on zooplankton and did not systematically change the water chemistry. There was no trend in the relative importance of fish effects with latitude, but nutrient addition affected more variables with decreasing latitude. 6. The relative importance of top-down and bottom-up influences on the plankton differed in different locations and between years at the same location. The outcome of the experiments in different years was more predictable with decreasing latitude and this was attributed to more variable weather at higher latitudes that created more variable starting conditions for the experiments.","2004",NA,"10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01302.x","WOS:000225316100001"

The objectives of this research were to determine the utility of a niche overlap index to realise the first screening of maize rhizobacterial isolates during different water activities. Studies were conducted to evaluate various methods for second screening with different modes of action. The antifungal activity of bacterial isolates through antibiosis assay was checked and the influence of different isolates on Fusarium verticilliodes growth and fumonisin B-1 was studied. Eleven competitive rhizobacterial isolates (Arthrobacter globiformis RC1, Azotobacter armeniacus RC2, A. armeniacus RC3, A. globiformis RC4, A. globiformis RC5, A. armeniacus RC6, Pseudomonas solanacearum RC7, Bacillus subtilis RC8, B. subtilis RC9, P. solanacearum RC10, B. subtilis RC11) were selected for the studies which followed. All bacteria were able to utilise the widest range of carbon sources and showed the highest niche overlap indices at the water activities tested. All bacterial antagonists reduced fumonisin B-1 production at all levels tested. Isolates belonging to Pseudomonas and Bacillus genera significantly inhibited fumonisin B-1 production, which ranged between 70 and 100%. Also, A. armeniacus RC2 caused important fumonisin B-1 reduction. The results of the present work suggest that A. armeniacus RC2, A. armeniacus RC3, B. subtilis RC8, B. subtilis RC9, B. subtilis RC 11, P. solanacearum RC7, and P. solanacearunt RC 10 could have practical value in the control of F. verticillioides root colonisation.

Azospirillum brasilense Cd exploited the same class of C compounds as the sorghum rhizobacteria and overlapped in their niche requirements. Since structure and functioning of a microbial community are largely affected by the flow rate of nutrient supply, the competitive behavior of A. brasilense Cd was studied in a chemostat mixed culture under C-limited conditions using disodium succinate as C source. Only at high growth rates, i.e., when the C source was highly supplied, A. brasilense Cd appeared to be a good competitor and it became the dominant species, whereas at low growth rates, it was outnumbered by the other species. However, the coexistence of all the strains was always maintained, thus suggesting that interactions other than competition or a potential cross-feeding might occur within the mixed culture.","2004",NA,"10.1139/W04-074","WOS:000225904800011"

In June, green algae made up 66% of the gut contents of S. rivulatus, whereas brown algae made up 69% of the gut contents of S. luridus. In October, brown algae constituted 90% and 95% of the diet of S. rivulatus and S. luridus, respectively. This is the first record of S. rivulatus feeding on and selecting large amounts of this brown, coarse, leaf-like algae along the Mediterranean coast of Israel. During spring the food niche overlap (Renkonen's measure) was ca. 36%, whereas during autumn it was ca. 80%.

A set of 11 strains of Brevundimonas alba were isolated from a bacterial freshwater community by conventional plating or by using a liquid most-probable-number (MPN) dilution series. These strains had identical 16S rRNA gene sequences and represented the dominant phylotype in the plateable fraction, as well as in the highest positive dilutions of the MPN series. However, internally transcribed spacer and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR fingerprinting analyses, as well as DNA-DNA hybridization analyses, revealed great genetic diversity among the 11 strains. Each strain utilized a specific combination of 59 carbon substrates, and the niche overlap indices were low, suggesting that each strain occupied a different ecological niche. In dialysis cultures incubated in situ, each strain had a different growth rate and cell yield. We thus demonstrated that the B. alba strains represent distinct populations with genetically determined adaptations and probably occupy different ecological niches. Our results have implications for assessment of the diversity and biogeography of bacteria and increase the perception of natural diversity beyond the level of 16S rRNA gene sequences.","2004",NA,"10.1128/AEM.70.8.4831-4839.2004","WOS:000223290100055"

Taking this effect into account improved the behavior of the model, the results of which came into qualitative agreement with the experimental results.

A key to progress in the field of biological control to protect maize against Fusarium verticillioides is to select in vitro the best agent to be applied in the field. This research was undertaken to evaluate the correlation between different screening methods and to suggest an adequate procedure that could be used to select bacterial agents with potential biocontrol against F verticillioides in the maize rhizosphere. The results show an extensive Pearson correlation coefficient analysis between different screening procedures carried out for Arthrobacter spp., Azotobacter spp., Pseudomonas spp., and Bacillus spp. paired with 13 F verticillioides strains isolated from maize endorhizosphere. The following screening methodologies were correlated: niche overlap index (NOI), indices of dominance, growth rate, lag phase, antibiosis, and fumonisin production. It was observed that NOI and antibiosis methodologies did not show any correlation. They were used to choose the best bacteria to apply under greenhouse conditions. Azotobacter armeniacus RC2 showed a NOI > 0.9 and inhibited all F verticillioides strains assayed. Seed maize bacterization with A. armeniacus RC2 at 10(6) and 10(7) inoculum level resulted in significantly lower values of F verticillioides counts compared to the control without bacteria at the root levels assayed. The analysis of variance indicated that there were significant interactions between two fungal repression assays. Antibiosis assays significantly correlated with greenhouse conditions (p < 0.01) at two inoculum levels tested. Therefore, the selection system adopted was adequate to choose the best bacterial biocontrol agent. The application of this methodology shows a way to outline the best biocontrol candidate.

"Egger, KN; Hibbett, DS","The evolutionary implications of exploitation in mycorrhizas","CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE","Some views of mutualism, where the fitness of two symbiotic partners is higher in association than when apart, assume that they necessarily evolve towards greater benefit for the partners. Most mutualisms, however, seem prone to conflicts of interest that destabilize the partnership. These conflicts arise in part because mutualistic outcomes are conditional, depending upon complex interactions between environmental, developmental, and genotypic factors. Mutualisms are also subject to exploitation or cheating. Although various compensating mechanisms have been proposed to explain how mutualism can be maintained in the presence of exploiters, none of these mechanisms can eliminate exploitation. In this paper we explore various compensating mechanisms in mycorrhizas, examine the evidence for exploitation in mycorrhizas, and conclude that mycorrhizal mutualisms exhibit characteristics that are more consistent with a concept of reciprocal parasitism. We propose that researchers should not assume mycorrhizas are mutualistic based upon structural characteristics or limited functional studies showing bilateral exchange and should view mycorrhizas as occupying a wider range on the symbiotic continuum, including commensalism and antagonism. We recommend that comparative studies of mycorrhizas incorporate other types of root associations that have traditionally been considered antagonistic.","2004",NA,"10.1139/B04-056","WOS:000223859200009"

In this research, we tested whether plant/soil community feedback occurs and if increased soil fertility altered the plant/soil community interactions. In two greenhouse experiments we assessed plant and AM fungal performance in response to different soils ( and their microbial communities), collected from under three co-occurring plants in serpentine grasslands, and nutrient treatments. The first experiment consisted of two plant species (Andropogon gerardii, Sorghastrum nutans), their soil communities, and three nutrient treatments ( control, calcium, N-P-K), while the second experiment used three plant species ( first two and Schizachyrium scoparium), their soil communities collected from a different site, and two nutrient treatments ( control, N-P-K). Plant/soil community feedback was observed with two of the three species and was significantly affected by nutrient enrichment. Negative Sorghastrum/soil feedback was removed with the addition of N-P-K fertilizer at both sites. Andropogon/soil feedback varied between sites and nutrient treatments, while no differential Schizachyrium growth relative to soil community was observed. Addition of N-P-K fertilizer to the nutrient poor serpentine soils increased plant biomass production and affected plant/soil community interactions. Calcium addition did not affect plant biomass, but was associated with significant increases in fungal colonization regardless of plant species or soil community. Our results indicate that nutrient enrichment affected plant/soil community feedback, which has the potential to affect plant and soil community structure.","2004",NA,"10.1023/B:PLSO.0000020936.56786.a4","WOS:000220405600002"

Thus, vesicular stomatitis virus strains with a history of genetic bottleneck have lower adaptability than strains maintained at relatively large population sizes. This lower adaptability is illustrated by their reduced ability to regain fitness and by their inability to outcompete wildtype populations in situations where the initial fitness of the bottlenecked mutant is the same or even higher than the initial fitness of the wild-type.

The multiple Wolbachia infections that occur naturally in A. albopictus make this mosquito a useful system in which to study CI. Here, experiments employ mosquito strains that have been introgressed to provide genetically similar strains that harbor differing Wolbachia infection types. Cytoplasmic incompatibility levels, host longevity, egg hatch rates, and fecundity are examined. Crossing results demonstrate a pattern of additive unidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility. Furthermore, relative to uninfected females, infected females are at a reproductive advantage due to both cytoplasmic incompatibility and a fitness increase associated with Wolbachia infection.

Fitness was measured as absolute growth rate per hour under the same conditions used for adaptation. T7 and T3 achieved the highest fitnesses, able to increase by 13 billionfold and three-quarters billionfold per hour, respectively. In contrast, the RNA phages achieved low fitness maxima, with growth rates approximately 400-fold and 4000-fold per hour. The highest fitness limits were not attributable to high mutation rates or small genome size, even though both traits are expected to enhance adaptation for fast growth. We suggest that major differences in fitness limits stem from different global constraints, determined by the organization and composition of the phage genome affecting whether and how it overcomes potentially rate-limiting host processes, such as transcription, translation, and replication. Adsorption rates were also measured on the evolved phages. No consistent pattern of adsorption rate and fitness was observed across the four different types of phages, but within each pair of related phages, higher adsorption was associated with higher fitness. Different adsorption rate limits within pairs may stem from local constraints-sequence differences leading to different local optima in the sequence space.","2004",NA,NA,"WOS:000221234700002"

Resistance-related HIV genotypes not commonly seen in treated patients, which likely result from reversion or loss of primary resistance mutations, have also been recognized in drug-naive persons. Little work has been done to characterize the patterns of mutations in these viruses and the frequency of occurrence, their association with phenotypic resistance, and their effect on fitness and evolution of resistance. Through the analysis of resistance mutations in 1082 newly diagnosed antiretroviral-naive persons from the United States, we found that 35 of 48 (72.9%) persons infected with HIV-1 containing thymidine analog mutations (TAMs) had viruses that lacked a primary mutation (T215Y/F, K70R, or Q151M). Of these viruses, 9 (25.7%) had only secondary TAMs (D67N, K219Q, M41L, or F77L), and all were found to be sensitive to zidovudine (AZT) and other drugs. To assess the impact of secondary TAMs on the evolution of AZT resistance, we generated recombinant viruses from cloned plasma-derived reverse transcriptase sequences. Two viruses had D67N, three had D67N and K219Q/E, and three were WT. Four site-directed mutants with D67N, K219Q, K219E, and D67N/K219Q were also made in HIV-1(HXB2). In vitro selection of AZT resistance showed that viruses with D67N and/or K219Q/E acquired AZT resistance mutations more rapidly than WT viruses (36 days compared to 54 days; P = 0.003). To investigate the factors associated with the rapid selection of AZT mutations in these viruses, we evaluated fitness differences among HXB2(WT) and HXB2(D67N) or HXB2(D67N/K219Q) in the presence of AZT. Both HXB2(D67N/K219Q) and HXB2D67N were more fit than HXB2(WT) in the presence of either low or high AZT concentrations, likely reflecting low-level resistance to AZT that is not detectable by phenotypic testing. In the absence of AZT, the fitness cost conferred by D67N or K219Q was modest. Our results demonstrate that viruses with unique patterns of TAMs, including D67N and/or K219Q/E, are commonly found among newly diagnosed persons and illustrate the expanding diversity of revertant viruses in this population. The modest fitness cost conferred by D67N and K219Q supports persistence of these mutants in the untreated population and highlights the potential for secondary transmission. The faster evolution of these mutants toward AZT resistance is consistent with the higher viral fitness in the presence of AZT and shows that these viruses are phenotypically different from WT HIV-1. Our study emphasizes the need for clinical studies to better define the impact of these mutants on treatment responses and evolution of resistance.","2004",NA,"10.1128/JVI.78.14.7545-7552.2004","WOS:000222407200028"
"Fox, JW","Effects of algal and herbivore diversity on the partitioning of biomass within and among trophic levels","ECOLOGY","Factorial manipulations of biodiversity on different trophic levels can reveal the mechanisms that govern how biomass is partitioned within and among trophic levels. Here I report results of a laboratory microcosm experiment crossing eight algal compositions (seven monocultures and a polyculture of all seven species) with five ciliate herbivore compositions (no herbivores, three monocultures, and a polyculture of all three species). Microcosms allowed comparison of short-, medium-, and long-term (dozens of generations) results. Niche differentiation allowed competing algae to coexist in the absence of herbivores. Surprisingly, algal polycultures produced more biomass than the most productive monocultures only in the medium term. A temporally variable relationship between the productivity of diverse and depauparate algal assemblages might reflect changes in competitive mechanisms over time, and/or transient dynamics, and contrasts with the predictions of simple competition models. Herbivores had little effect on total algal biomass or algal composition, in part because of the lack of a strong trade-off between algal competitive ability and edibility. Increasing algal diversity significantly reduced the biomass of one herbivore, apparently because competition from inedible algae reduced the productivity of edible algae. A negative effect of inedible algae on herbivore biomass accords with simple food web theory and indicates that increasing diversity on one trophic level can have negative consequences for other trophic levels. Herbivores varied little in their abilities to graze different algae. Total algal biomass, algal composition, and total herbivore biomass were independent of herbivore diversity and composition, and algal composition had only minor effects the outcome of competition among herbivores. However, the outcome of herbivore competition was predictably asymmetrical. indicating that herbivores varied in other ways, such as ability to consume alternative food sources (bacteria). Further factorial manipulations of diversity and trophic structure are needed to improve understanding of the likely consequences of species loss in food webs. These experiments should last as long as possible, since the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem properties may depend as much on when the relationship is measured as on species identity and the degree of niche differentiation among species.","2004",NA,"10.1890/03-0095","WOS:000220108700024"

Physiological and genomic studies suggest that natural selection promotes niche differentiation among these phototrophic microorganisms, particularly with respect to their photosynthetic characteristics(14-16). We have analysed competition for light between two closely related picocyanobacteria of the Synechococcus group that we isolated from the Baltic Sea(17). One of these two has a red colour because it contains the pigment phycoerythrin, whereas the other is blue-green because it contains high contents of the pigment phycocyanin. Here we report theory and competition experiments that reveal stable coexistence of the two picocyanobacteria, owing to partitioning of the light spectrum. Further competition experiments with a third marine cyanobacterium, capable of adapting its pigment composition, show that this species persists by investing in the pigment that absorbs the colour not used by its competitors. These results demonstrate the adaptive significance of divergence in pigment composition of phototrophic microorganisms, which allows an efficient utilization of light energy and favours species coexistence.","2004",NA,"10.1038/nature03044","WOS:000224854900049"

Adaptation to different redox conditions was shown to be one mechanism that supported the coexistence of functionally similar Achromatium spp. In sediment microcosms, in which the overlying water was oxygenated, Achromatium community size and composition remained unchanged over time. However, imposition of anoxic conditions induced changes in community structure. Anoxia caused a reduction in the relative abundance of Achromatium sp. RY8 (72 +/- 4% to 49 +/- 2%) and an increase in Achromatium sp. RY5 (19 +/- 5% to 32 +/- 3%) and a newly identified Achromatium sp., RYKS (14 +/- 4% to 27 +/- 2%). In anoxic microcosms supplemented with a single addition of nitrate at different initial concentrations the relative decline in Achromatium sp. RY8 was dependent on the initial nitrate concentration. In these experiments nitrate was rapidly removed. In contrast, when high levels of nitrate were maintained by periodic replacement of the overlying water with nitrate supplemented anoxic water, the composition of the Achromatium community remained stable over time. This suggested that all of the coexisting Achromatium spp. are obligate or facultative anaerobes, but, Achromatium sp.

Ecosystem isotope patterns were similar at the two forests, but differences existed that appear to reflect soil nitrogen availability and C allocation within the ectomycorrhizal symbioses. delta(15)N and delta(13)C of ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi differed in both forests, and a dual delta(15)N/delta(13)C plot provided the best means of distinguishing them. Within both groups, delta(15)N and delta(13)C differed among genera and species, and the difference in species composition was an important determinant of the different overall delta(15)N of the ectomycorrhizal fungi at the two forests. Variation in multiple ecophysiological traits such as organic N use, mycelial morphology and transfer of N to phytobionts appears to underlie the variation in the isotope signatures of ectomycorrhizal fungi. The varied isotope signatures of ectomycorrhizal fungi suggest considerable functional diversity among them. Life-history strategies could provide a framework for interpreting these patterns.","2004",NA,"10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01162.x","WOS:000224346900010"

DNA samples were collected from the mixolimnion (2 m), the base of the oxycline (17.5 m), the upper chemocline (23 m), and the monimolimnion (35 m). Composition was assessed by sequencing randomly selected cloned fragments of 16S rRNA genes retrieved from the DNA samples. Most of the 212 sequences retrieved from the samples fell into five major lineages of the domain Bacteria: alpha- and gamma-Proteobacteria (6 and 10%, respectively), Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides (19%), high-G+C-content gram-positive organisms (Actinobacteria; 25%), and low-G+C-content gram-positive organisms (Bacillus and Clostridium; 19%). Twelve percent were identified as chloroplasts. The remaining 9% represented beta- and delta-Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobiales, and candidate divisions. Mixolimnion and oxycline samples had low microbial diversity, with only 9 and 12 distinct phylotypes, respectively, whereas chemocline and monimolimnion samples were more diverse, containing 27 and 25 phylotypes, respectively. The compositions of microbial assemblages from the mixolimnion and oxycline were not significantly different from each other (P = 0.314 and 0.877), but they were significantly different from those of chemocline and monimolimnion assemblages (P < 0.001), and the compositions of chemocline and monimolimnion assemblages were not significantly different from each other (P = 0.006 and 0.124). The populations of sequences retrieved from the mixolimnion and oxycline samples were dominated by sequences related to high-G+C-content grampositive bacteria (49 and 63%, respectively) distributed in only three distinct phylotypes, while the population of sequences retrieved from the monimolimnion sample was dominated (52%) by sequences related to low-G+C-content gram-positive bacteria distributed in 12 distinct phylotypes. Twelve and 28% of the sequences retrieved from the chemocline sample were also found in the mixolimnion and monimolimnion samples, respectively.

Effects of storage period, milk kind and concentration method on physicochemical properties of samples were investigated statistically. The effect of storage period on pH, penetration and whey off values of bifighurts was significant (p > 0.05), but had no effect on total solids, fat and protein contents (p < 0.05). Significant differences were found in total solids and fat contents of bifighurts (p > 0.05), but not in acidity (degrees SH) and pH (p < 0.05) in respect to milk kind used.

A combination of numerical and analytical techniques was used to analyse the model. We found that pseudovertical transmission and indirect transmission via infectious units in the 'general' environment can lead to more groups being affected, but otherwise have relatively little effect on the invasion criteria.

In 1980 the external phosphorus loading (1.8 g TP m(-2) a(-1)) decreased by 90%, but water quality did not improve significantly within the following 6 years. In 1985 biomanipulation was initiated, with manual removal of cyprinid fish coupled with piscivore introductions as the principal measures. The expected changes in the pelagic community and improvements of water quality occurred after a delay of several years. Despite intensive manual removal of cyprinids and stocking of piscivores, standing stocks of cyprinid fish remained relatively high (130-260 kg ww ha(-1)) after some years of decline. Compared to the pre-biomanipulation period, mean seasonal (May-September) Daphnia spp. biomass roughly doubled (0.037 C m(-3) vs. 0.084 g C m(-3)). However, the predominance of small (< 1 mm) D. cucullata throughout the whole investigation period indicated that planktivory was still substantial. Paired observations between edible phytoplankton biomass and Daphnia spp. indicated that a significant decline in algal stocks would only occur if herbivorous biomass was above a certain threshold (0.2 g C m(-3)). Reduced external and internal loading in concert with pelagic calcite precipitation were most likely responsible for the decline in lake phosphorus concentrations, thereby Substantially improving the water quality of Feldberger Haussee. Although this is not supported by quantitative evidence, we hypothesize that resource-related water quality improvements were caused by changes in the structure of the pelagic community leading to increased calcite precipitation. In agreement with the results of other investigations, we conclude that because stabilising mechanisms such as macrophyte growth were lacking in Feldberger Haussee, biomanipulation in stratified lakes may not be as successful as has been observed in shallow lakes. However, in hard-water lakes, calcite precipitation may act as another stabilising resource-related mechanism. Phosphorus associated with sedimenting calcite particles is insensitive to redox-conditions and may therefore not be re-mobilised from lake sediments even if hypolimnetic oxygen is depleted.","2003",NA,"10.1016/S0075-9511(03)80013-0","WOS:000185890700003"

The study was carried out on the largest Italian Lake (Lake Garda) from 1995 to 2000. Different statistical analyses were applied. For phytoplankton the time variable represents a complex environmental gradient driving annual succession; this gradient was made explicit by the application of PCA analyses to the environmental data. The use of Non Metric Multi Dimensional Scaling applied to Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrices revealed an ordered and cyclic development of phytoplankton every year; the Bray-Curtis index, calculated between pairs of chronologically contiguous samples, was also used as a measure of the community change rate (beta(t)) over the temporal succession. A significant relationship between beta(t) and the complex environmental gradient was assessed. Finally, for every phytoplankton species, the optimum conditions for growth and the realised niches were determined. The positioning of the species on the complex environmental gradient, and the contemporaneous application of cluster analysis based on the different specific environmental optima, highlighted primarily the existence of two groups at the extreme of the complex environmental gradient. The first group included the large late winter/spring diatoms, which developed during high water turbulence and strong physical control, high nutrient concentrations, low light conditions and reduced competition. The second group was composed by many heterogeneous summer species characterised by the ability to contrast losses by grazing and sinking in stratified and stable conditions, and the ability of tolerating nutrient deficiency. A third group of species developed during environmental conditions in the middle of the two previous extremes. These included the three master species Mougeotia sp., Fragilaria crotonensis and Planktothrix rubescens/agardhii. The endogenous and exogenous mechanisms promoting species coexistence are discussed, along with the applicability of competitive and equilibrium/non-equilibrium theories to phytoplankton dynamics.","2003",NA,"10.1023/B:HYDR.0000004267.64870.85","WOS:000186636900002"

When weakly beneficial mutualists and parasites have a competitive advantage over strongly beneficial mutualists, it is not clear how strongly beneficial mutualists persist. If mutualism is destabilized by competitive superiority of weakly beneficial mutualists or cheaters, then mechanisms providing for stable coexistence among competing species may also provide for the persistence of mutualism. We analyze coexistence of species within a mutualist guild using a simple spatial model of patch occupancy to suggest hypotheses about the ecological persistence of mutualism in the interaction between plants and ectomycorrhizal fungi. We suggest that plants could facilitate the persistence of mutualistic mycorrhizal fungi by enhancing the mortality of root tips colonized by competitively superior and less mutualistic fungi. We also discuss previous empirical studies and present original data from field observations in plant-ectomycorrhizal systems to address our predictions and to suggest profitable avenues for further work.","2003",NA,"10.1086/378644","WOS:000186657900004"

Previous work has demonstrated that negative soil community feedback can contribute to the coexistence of equivalent competitors. In this paper, I show that negative soil community feedback can also contribute to the coexistence of strong competitors, maintaining plant species that would not coexist in the absence of soil community dynamics. I review the evidence for soil community feedback and find accumulating evidence that soil community feedback can be common, strongly negative, and generated by a variety of complementary soil microbial mechanisms, including host-specific changes in the composition of the rhizosphere bacteria, nematodes, pathogenic fungi, and mycorrhizal fungi.

However, the presence and heterogeneity of biotic plant resources, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), could also affect plant species coexistence. In this study, Brachypodium pinnatum and Prunella vulgaris were grown together in pots and biotic resource heterogeneity was simulated by inoculating these pots with one of three different AMF taxa, with a mixture of these three taxa, or pots remained uninoculated. The AMF acted as biotic plant resources since the biomass of plants in pots inoculated with AMF was on average 11.8 times higher than uninoculated pots. The way in which the two plant species coexisted, and the distribution of phosphorus and nitrogen between the plant species, varied strongly depending on which AMF were present. The results showed that the composition of AMF communities determines how plant species coexist and to which plant species nutrients are allocated.

"Klironomos, JN","Variation in plant response to native and exotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi","ECOLOGY","High variability in plant-growth response to the presence of different mycorrhizal fungi can be a major determinant of local plant species diversity. Multiple species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can coexist in terrestrial ecosystems, and co-occurring plants can differ in their response to colonization by these different fungi. However, the range of mycorrhizal plant-growth responses that can occur within communities has not been determined. In the present study, I crossed a large number of plant and fungal species that co-occur to determine the range of responses that can exist within an ecosystem. I also crossed exotic fungal isolates vs. local plant isolates and local fungal isolates vs. exotic plant isolates to determine whether the range of plant growth responses differs when using foreign genotypes. The data indicate that plant growth responses to mycorrhizal inoculation within an ecosystem can range from highly parasitic to highly mutualistic. In this study, the direction and magnitude of the response depended on the combination of plant and fungal species. No plant did best with the same fungal isolate. The range of responses was greatest when using local plants and fungi. Whereas parasitic and mutualistic responses were also detected when using foreign plant or fungal genotypes, the range of responses was significantly reduced, as was the relative frequency of positive responses. Overall, this study suggests that, within ecosystems, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can function along a continuum from parasitism to mutualism, and that extreme responses are more common when using locally adapted plants and fungi. This high variation in plant growth response may be a large contributor to plant species coexistence and the structure of plant communities.","2003",NA,"10.1890/02-0413","WOS:000185226100006"

The screening procedure exploited carbon source utilization profiles and growth rates of bacteria as indicators of a partial niche overlap with the pathogen. The bacteria were tested for growth on nine carbon sources (glucose, fucose, sucrose, maltose, asparagine, alanine, galacturonic acid, succinic acic, and linoleic acid), most of which are reported to be used by the zoospores of P. aphanidermatum in the infection process. The isolates were classified as fast- or slow-growing, depending on their growth rate in 1/10 strength TSB. By nonhierarchical cluster analysis, 20 clusters were generated of bacteria with similar profiles of carbon source utilization. Redundancy analysis showed that the type of root sample explained 47% of the variance found in the relative abundance of bacteria from the clusters. Bacteria from clusters using none or few of the carbon sources, e.g., maltose and linoleic acid, with many slow-growing isolates, showed a preference for plants in the vegetative or generative stage, or for old root regions (root base). Bacteria from clusters with fast-growing isolates, using many carbon sources, were relatively abundant in the seedling stage. A selection of 127 bacteria from the different clusters was tested for disease suppressive capabilities in bioassays on young cucumber plants in nutrient solution, inoculated with zoospores of P. aphanidermatum. Nine of these bacteria produced biosurfactants, and 27 showed antibiosis against mycelial growth in plate as I says. For 31 isolates, significant positive effects on plant biomass were shown, as analyzed with a general linear regression model. For most isolates, these effects occurred only in one of two replicate assays and no reductions in the degree of root and crown rot were found. Of the isolates that used many of the tested carbon sources, only four had positive effects on plant biomass. The majority of the isolates that positively affected plant biomass used few to moderate numbers of carbon sources and did not produce antibiotics or biosurfactants. In conclusion, competition for the tested carbon sources with the zoospores did not play a decisive role in disease suppression, and no clear relation was found between ecophysiological traits and disease suppression. Only isolate 3.1T8, isolated from root tips in the generative stage of plant growth, significantly increased plant biomass and suppressed root and crown rot symptoms in five out of six bioassays. The isolate produced an antifungal substance in plate assays and showed biosurfactant production in several (cucumber-derived) media.","2003",NA,"10.1007/s00248-002-2013-0","WOS:000180792400008"

There is currently no standardization to how the rate of phase variation is determined experimentally, and traditional methods of mutation rate estimation may not be appropriate to this process. Here, the history of mutation rate estimation is reviewed, describing the existing methods available. A new mathematical model that can be applied to this problem is also presented. This model specifically includes the confounding factors of back-mutation and the influence of fitness differences between the alternate phenotypes. These are central features of phase variation but are rarely addressed, with the result that some previously estimated phase variation rates may have been significantly overestimated. It is shown that, conversely, the model can also be used to investigate fitness differences if mutation rates are approximately known. In addition, stochastic simulations of the model are used to explore the impact of jackpot cultures' on the mutation rate estimation. Using the model, the impact of realistic rates and selection on population structure is investigated. In the absence of fitness differences it is predicted that there will be phenotypic stability over many generations. The rate of phenotypic change within a population is likely, therefore, to be principally determined by selection. A greater insight into the population dynamics of mutation rate processes can be gained if populations are monitored over successive time points.","2003",NA,"10.1099/mic.0.25807-0","WOS:000181006200020"

F statistics revealed a significant amount of differentiation among subpopulations and an excess of heterozygotes within subpopulations. Heterozygous individuals also had higher rates of vegetative growth. The superior performance and excess of heterozygotes suggests that selection favors heterozygous individuals.

After 48 weeks of PI-based therapy, a strong correlation was observed between protease genetic divergence and viral fitness difference (r = 0.78, P = 0.03), but not with reverse transcription or Env divergence, suggesting that genotypic changes in the protease gene were driving HIV-1 evolution in these patients. As expected, an inverse correlation was observed between the number of protease and reverse transcription primary mutations and viral fitness (r = -0.65, P < 0.0001).

In this study, nine subtype B and six subtype C HIV-1 isolates were added to peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures for a complete pairwise competition experiment. All subtype C HIV-1 isolates were less fit than subtype B isolates (P < 0.0001), but intrasubtype variations in HIV-1 fitness were not significant. Increased fitness of subtype B over subtype C was also observed in primary CD4(+) T cells and macrophages from different human donors but not in skin-derived human Langerhans cells. Detailed analysis of the retroviral life cycle during several B and C virus competitions indicated that the efficiency of host cell entry may have a significant impact on relative fitness. Furthermore, phyletic analyses of fitness differences suggested that, for a recombined subtype B/C HIV-1 isolate, higher fitness mapped to the subtype B env gene rather than the subtype C gag and pot genes.

"Wilke, CO; Novella, IS","Phenotypic mixing and hiding may contribute to memory in viral quasispecies","BMC MICROBIOLOGY","Background: In a number of recent experiments with food-and-mouth disease virus, a deleterious mutant, RED, was found to avoid extinction and remain in the population for long periods of time. Since RED characterizes the past evolutionary history of the population, this observation was called quasispecies memory. While the quasispecies theory predicts the existence of these memory genomes, there is a disagreement between the expected and observed mutant frequency values. Therefore, the origin of quasispecies memory is not fully understood. Results: We propose and analyze a simple model of complementation between the wild type virus and a mutant that has an impaired ability of cell entry, the likely cause of fitness differences between wild type and RED mutants. The mutant will go extinct unless it is recreated from the wild type through mutations. However, under phenotypic mixing-and-hiding as a mechanism of complementation, the time to extinction in the absence of mutations increases with increasing multiplicity of infection ( m.o.i.). If the RED mutant is constantly recreated by mutations, then its frequency at equilibrium under selection-mutation balance also increases with increasing m.o.i. At high m.o.i., a large fraction of mutant genomes are encapsidated with wild-type protein, which enables them to infect cells as efficiently as the wild type virions, and thus increases their fitness to the wild-type level. Moreover, even at low m.o.i. the equilibrium frequency of the mutant is higher than predicted by the standard quasispecies model, because a fraction of mutant virions generated from wild-type parents will also be encapsidated by wild-type protein. Conclusions: Our model predicts that phenotypic hiding will strongly influence the population dynamics of viruses, particularly at high m.o.i., and will also have important effects on the mutation-selection balance at low m.o.i. The delay in mutant extinction and increase in mutant frequencies at equilibrium may, at least in part, explain memory in quasispecies populations.","2003",NA,"10.1186/1471-2180-3-11","WOS:000184709800001"

Soil-dwelling microorganisms are diverse, and interactions with plants vary with respect to specificity, environmental heterogeneity, and fitness impact. Two microbial processes that may exert key influences on plant community structure and dynamics are microbial mediation of niche differentiation in resource use and feedback dynamics between the plant and soil community. The niche differentiation hypothesis is based on observations that soil nutrients occur in different chemical forms, that different enzymes are required for plant access to these nutrients, and that soil microorganisms are a major source of these enzymes. We predict that plant nutrient partitioning arises from differential associations of plant species with microbes able to access different nutrient pools. Feedback dynamics result from changes in the soil community generated by the specificity of response in plant-microbe interactions. We suggest that positive feedback between plants and soil microbes plays a central role in early successional communities, while negative feedback contributes both to species replacements and to diversification in later successional communities. We further suggest that plant-microbe interactions in the soil are an important organizing force for large-scale spatial gradients in species richness. The relative balance of positive feedback (a homogenizing force) and negative feedback (a diversifying force) may contribute to observed latitudinal (and altitudinal) diversity patterns. Empirical tests of these ideas are needed, but a microbially based perspective for plant ecology promises to contribute to our understanding of long-standing issues in ecology, and to reveal new areas of future research.","2003",NA,"10.1890/02-0298","WOS:000185226100005"

Although the two strains have 1,350 genes in common, a significant number are not shared, and these have been differentially retained from the common ancestor, or acquired through duplication or lateral transfer.

"Zhang, ZB","Mutualism or cooperation among competitors promotes coexistence and competitive ability","ECOLOGICAL MODELLING","In the Lotka-Volterra competition model and similar competition models, species can only coexist if between-species competition is weaker than within species. Prior modeling and field studies have shown that coexistence can be promoted by reducing the competitive ability between species through spatial or temporal niche differentiation. Colonization, disturbance, aggregations in patchy habitats, resource transport and supply rates, predation, sex ratio mediation have been suggested to promote species coexistence. The role of mutualism in promoting species coexistence has never been quantitatively studied. In this study, by starting from the traditional Lotka-Volterra competition model, a new general model with introduction of mutualism between two competitive species is proposed. We hypothesized that the interaction of one species to the other is flexible instead of always negative; the zero growth isoclines of the competing species are parabolic. Three conclusions are drawn from this modeling study. First, mutualism is a new way of promoting coexistences of two species. Second, mutualism often increases the carrying capacities of both species, and then promotes their competitive abilities. Third, the mutualism-competition model is also appropriate to describe the dynamics of cooperation and competition between individuals or groups within species, and mutualism between plants and animals. The behind mechanism lies in mutualism or cooperation reduced the severity of competition at low density. Inferior competitor, if cooperative to superior competitor, is also possible to survive. Since mutualism or cooperation is commonly seen among competitors or between prey and predators, its role in shaping social or community structure is worth to explore. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this paper we assume that where nutrient dynamics are much faster than the dynamics of fungal biomass and substrate, the system will reach a quasi-steady-state relatively quickly. We show how the quasi-steady-state approximation is a simplification of the full fungal growth model. We then derive an explicit fungal invasion criterion, which was not possible for the full model, and characterize parameter domains for invasion and extinction. Importantly, the fungal invasion criterion takes two forms: one for systems where carbon is limiting, another for systems where nitrogen is limiting. We focus attention on what happens in the short term immediately following the introduction of a fungus to a fungal-free system by analysing the stability of the trivial steady state, and then check numerically whether the fungus is able to persist. The derived invasion criterion was found to be valid also for the full model. Knowledge of the factors that determine invasion is essential to an understanding of fungal dynamics. The simplified model allows the invasion criterion to be tested with experimental data.","2002",NA,NA,"WOS:000181449800001"

We placed nutrient-diffusing substrata in the littoral zone of the Bay during 1991 (early Dreissena colonization) and from 1992 to 1995 (post-Dreissena colonization). The treatments consisted of P, N, and P + N additions, and a control. Chlorophyll a decreased through time from 1992 to 1995. Phosphorus limited biovolume only in 1994. Treatments with P additions had significantly more chlorophyll a than the controls each year after 1992. This result was consistent with an observed decrease in dissolved P throughout the study. Nitrogen additions had no significant effect throughout the 5-y period. Major shifts in species composition did not result from nutrient additions but rather seemed to be consistent with changes in light penetration and Dreissena herbivory. Our data demonstrated that the pre-Dreissena benthic algal community was dominated by tychoplanktonic diatoms (i.e., Aulacoseira granulata and Tabellaria fenestrata), which would be susceptible to filter-feeding Dreissena. Early post-invasion conditions were marked by an increase in light penetration, and benthic algae were dominated by filamentous green algae (mostly Spirogyra sp.). Late post-invasion conditions were marked by a reduction of light caused by planktonic blooms of Microcystis sp., which were resistant to zebra mussel herbivory. The benthic algal dominance shifted to periphytic diatoms (i.e., Gomphonema clevei), which were also resistant to zebra mussel filter-feeding. A new equilibrium may be developing where Dreissena herbivory limits tychoplanktonic diatoms, which promotes Microcystis bloom, which in turn limits Dreissena filtering rates.","2002",NA,"10.2307/1468412","WOS:000176159000004"

This situation was modelled to analyse the dynamics of a plant virus epidemic in a combined nursery-plantation system and the comparative effects of disease management activities in the plantation and in the nursery. The plant populations were partitioned into healthy and diseased categories and were linked according to basic SI models of disease transmission. Removal of diseased plants and replanting operations in both the plantation and nursery were included in the model and two variants were analysed in which mother plants (from which cuttings were taken) remained in the plantation or were harvested. The former is shown to be the limiting case for a large number of cuttings per plant. A criterion was derived for the invasion of disease into a healthy combined system. This consisted of four additive terms: the basic reproductive numbers of disease in the plantation alone and in the nursery alone, and two terms describing the cycling of diseased material between the plantation and nursery. Disease can still invade the system with basic reproductive numbers in the plantation or in the nursery less than 1 depending on the magnitude of cycling. Under some conditions only diseased plants remain in the plantation and nursery. For such a case a criterion was derived for the invasion of healthy plants into a fully diseased system. This depended on replanting rates in the plantation and nursery, and infection, mortality and removal rates of healthy plants.","2002",NA,NA,"WOS:000181449600001"

This method was used to screen amino acid pairs substituted for the disulfide (S-S) bond between residues 14 and 38 of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. The mutants selected could be divided into two groups: one with mutation C14G and the other with mutation C38V. Although each mutation did not fully compensate for the destabilizing effect of removal of the S-S bond, these mutants have midpoint temperatures of thermal unfolding that are 12-17 degreesC higher than that of the C14A/C38A mutant. This fact indicates that these mutations are better substitutions for the S-S bond than C14A/C38A. The C14G mutants inhibited trypsin more strongly at 37 degreesC than did the C14A/C38A mutant, although bulky amino acids at position 14 largely diminished the inhibitory activity of the C38V mutants. Thermodynamic analysis indicated that the enthalpy of unfolding of the C14G and C38V mutant groups differed considerably, which suggests different stabilizing mechanisms in these two groups. Because renaturation of S-S bonds is often difficult in the large scale production of proteins, this method should provide a useful tool with which to increase the production of recombinant proteins by eliminating S-S bonds with minimum concomitant stability loss.","2002",NA,"10.1074/jbc.M208893200","WOS:000180177700111"
"Hunt, HW; Wall, DH","Modelling the effects of loss of soil biodiversity on ecosystem function","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY","There are concerns about whether accelerating worldwide loss of biodiversity will adversely affect ecosystem functioning and services such as forage production. Theoretically, the loss of some species or functional groups might be compensated for by changes in abundance of other species or functional groups such that ecosystem processes are unaffected. A simulation model was constructed for carbon and nitrogen transfers among plants and functional groups of microbes and soil fauna. The model was based on extensive information from shortgrass prairie, and employed stabilizing features such as prey refuges and predator switching in the trophic equations. Model parameters were derived either from the literature or were estimated to achieve a good fit between model predictions and data. The model correctly represented M the major effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 and plant species on root and shoot biomass, residue pools, microbial biomass and soil inorganic nitrogen, and (ii) the effects on plant growth of manipulating the composition of the microbial and faunal community. The model was evaluated by comparing predictions to data not used in model development. The 15 functional groups of microbes and soil fauna were deleted one at a time and the model was run to steady state. Only six of the 15 deletions led to as much as a 15% change in abundance of a remaining group, and only two deletions (bacteria and saprophytic fungi) led to extinctions of other groups. Functional groups with greater effect on abundance of other groups were those with greater biomass or greater number of consumers, regardless of trophic position. Of the six deletions affecting the abundance of other groups, only three (bacteria, saprophytic fungi, and root-feeding nematodes) caused as much as 10% changes in indices of ecosystem function (nitrogen mineralization and primary production). While the soil fauna as a whole were important for maintenance of plant production, no single faunal group had a significant effect. These results suggest that ecosystems could sustain the loss of some functional groups with little decline in ecosystem services, because of compensatory changes in the abundance of surviving groups. However, this prediction probably depends on the nature of stabilizing mechanisms in the system, and these mechanisms are not fully understood.","2002",NA,"10.1046/j.1365-2486.2002.00425.x","WOS:000173518600003"

(26degrees38' N, 127degrees52' E) in Okinawa, Japan were compared. Inside the territory, an algal farm, i.e., a dense stand of a filamentous rhodophyte, Womersleyella setacea, was maintained throughout the year. Outside the territory, in areas subjected to intensive and continuous grazing by various grazers, the flora was composed of mat-like cyanophytes, a prostrate turf-form Padina sp., microscopically thin filaments and scattered filamentous rhodophytes. Algal biomass was greater inside the territory than outside the territory of the damselfish. These differences were reflected by the structure of the associated foraminiferal communities. We classified foraminiferal species based on their microhabitat use around algal communities into four life types: free-living type, crawling type, sedentary type, and sessile type, The abundance of foraminifera, especially the free-living type (e.g,, Peneroplis pertusus and Quinqueloculina seminulum) and sedentary type (Rosalina globularis and Cymbaloporetta squammosa), was greater inside the territory of the damselfish than outside the territory. Species richness was also higher inside the territory, mainly due to an increase in species richness of the free-living and sedentary types. These increases in abundance and species richness were caused by habitat structuring. TV setacea is a relatively tall and complicated alga with tangled rhizoids. Its dense stand inside the territory trapped a larger amount of sediment, which provided free-living foraminifera with heterogeneous and stable habitats. In addition, the dense stand of TV setacea provided sedentary-type foraminifera with a large, complex substratum, providing refuge and food inside the territory. This assumption was confirmed by the results of plate experiments showing that foraminiferal community structures were controlled by associations between foraminifera and algae.

In this study, the dynamics of three common formulations for the NPZD class of models (nutrient, phytoplankton, zooplankton and detritus) using two different types of Predation functional response are analysed and compared. Our goal is to characterize the stability properties of this class of models with respect to variations in light and total nutrient concentrations. Despite important structural differences, the different model formulations all show asymptotic stable equilibria at low total nutrient concentrations and high to moderate light intensities, and limit cycle oscillations at low light intensities and high total nitrogen concentrations. Limit cycles are formed through a Hopf bifurcation as a phase tag develops between predator (Z(i)) and prey (P-i or Z(i) 1) due to a relatively sharp increase in the growth rate of the pray in relation to that of the predator. The use of variable preferences in the functional response provides a density-dependent mechanism that allows the system to self-regulate, increasing system stability considerably, but does not eliminate the instabilities completely. Instabilities occur at light and nutrient levels that correspond to those observed on the bottom of the euphotic zone near the nutricline, where the deep chlorophyll maximum is usually located. This suggests that the deep chlorophyll maximum might be dynamically unstable. This dynamic disequilibrium in species composition and the characteristically long transient times would allow species persistence in the presence of seasonal and mesoscale variations and provide a mechanism for species coexistence in the relatively homogeneous open ocean environment, thereby providing a potential solution for the 'paradox of plankton'. In the multi-species models, the higher diversity of species (wider range of values for the biological parameters) allows biological activity (photosynthesis, grazing and predation) to occur under a wider range of light and nutrient conditions, resulting in higher primacy and secondary production and lower nutrient concentrations at light intensities equivalent to those in the upper part of the eupholic zone, than in the single-species model.","2002",NA,"10.1093/plankt/24.6.533","WOS:000176796300001"

Similarity in carbon source utilization was quantified as the ratio of the number of tomato carbon sources utilized in vitro by the biological control agent to the number of tomato carbon sources utilized in vitro by the target pathogen (the niche overlap index [NOI]). Suppression of the disease was quantified as the percent reduction in disease severity compared to the pathogen-only control when nonpathogenic bacteria were applied to foliage 48 h prior to the pathogen. In the collection of 36 nonpathogenic bacterial strains, there was a significant (P < 0.01), but weak (r(2) = 0.25), correlation between reduction in disease severity and similarity in carbon source utilization, suggesting that similarity in carbon source use was significant in determining ability to suppress disease. The relationship was investigated further using catabolic mutants of P. syringae strain TLP2, an effective biological control agent of speck. Catabolic mutants exhibited lower levels of similarity (NOI = 0.07 to 0.90) than did wild-type TLP2 (NOI = 0.93). With these catabolic mutants there was a significant (P < 0.01), and stronger (r(2) = 0.42), correlation between reduction in disease severity and similarity in carbon source utilization. This suggests that similarity in carbon source utilization was a more important component of biological control ability for the catabolic mutants than for the nonpathogenic bacteria. Together, these studies indicate that suppression of bacterial speck of tomato was correlated with nutritional similarity between the pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria and suggest that preemptive utilization of carbon sources was probably involved in the biological control of the disease by both the naturally occurring nonpathogenic bacteria and the catabolic mutants.","2002",NA,"10.1128/AEM.68.9.4383-4389.2002","WOS:000177718000030"

Aggregation pheromones can evolve when individuals benefit from clustering. Such a situation can arise with an Allee effect, i.e. a positive relationship between individual fitness and density of conspecifics. Aggregation pheromone in Drosophila induces aggregated oviposition. The aim of the work reported here was to identify an Allee effect in the larval resource exploitation by Drosophila melanogaster , which could explain the evolution of aggregation pheromone in this species. 2. It is hypothesised that an Allee effect in D. melanogaster larvae arises from an increased efficiency of a group of larvae to temper fungal growth on their feeding substrate. To test this hypothesis, standard apple substrates were infested with specified numbers of larvae, and their survival and development were monitored. A potential beneficial effect of the presence of adult flies was also investigated by incubating a varying number of adults on the substrate before introducing the larvae. Adults inoculate substrates with yeast, on which the larvae feed. 3. Fungal growth was related negatively to larval survival and the size of the emerging flies. Although the fungal growth on the substrate was largely reduced at increased larval densities, the measurements of fitness components indicated no Allee effect between larval densities and larval fitness, but rather indicated larval competition. 4. In contrast, increased adult densities on the substrates prior to larval development yielded higher survival of the larvae, larger emerging flies, and also reduced fungal growth on the substrates. Hence, adults enhanced the quality of the larval substrate and significant benefits of aggregated oviposition in fruit flies were shown. Experiments with synthetic pheromone indicated that the aggregation pheromone itself did not contribute directly to the quality of the larval resource. 5.

Known ectomycorrhizal species were found in all six clusters. This spatial partitioning observed among ectomycorrhizal fungi along a single, relatively simple substrate-resource gradient supports the niche differentiation hypothesis as an important mechanism contributing to ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity.","2002",NA,"10.1046/j.1469-8137.2002.00535.x","WOS:000179411800020"

In estuaries along the Maine Coast, the FF homozygote has higher fitness in exposed, high-tide level microhabitats while the SS homozygote has higher fitness under algal cover or at low-tide microhabitats. These patterns are consistent with a Levene (1953) model of balancing selection. In these same samples, polymorphisms at the glucose phosphate isomerase locus (Gpi) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) show no fitness differences among microhabitats, providing intra-genomic controls supporting selection at or near Mpi. Here we report a similar analysis of genotype-by-microhabitat associations at sites in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, close to the southern range limit of S. balanoides. Genotype zonation at Mpi between high- and low-tide microhabitats is significantly different between Maine and Narragansett Bay due to opposite zonation patterns for the SF and FF genotypes. Enzyme activity, data are consistent with this reverse zonation. At Gpi, there is significant microhabitat zonation in Narragansett Bay, while this locus behaves as a neutral marker in Maine. Nit DNA shows no significant microhabitat zonation in either Rhode Island or Maine. The Mpi data suggest that Levene-type selection for alternative genotypes in alternative habitats may operate at scales of both 10's of meters and 100's of kilometers. The Gpi data show how an apparently, neutral locus can exhibit non-neutral variation under different environmental conditions. We argue that both Mpi and Gpi provide important genetic variation for adaptation to environmental heterogeneity that is recruited under distinct conditions of stress and carbohydrate substrate availability.","2002",NA,"10.1093/icb/42.4.825","WOS:000180793500015"

Previous laboratory experiments conducted with Nitrosomonas europaea suggested that ammonia-oxidizing bacteria are weak competitors for ammonium. To obtain a better insight into possible methods of niche differentiation among ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, we carried out a growth experiment at low ammonium concentrations with N. europaea and the ammonia oxidizer G5-7, a close relative of Nitrosomonas oligotropha belonging to Nitrosomonas cluster 6a, enriched from a freshwater sediment. Additionally, we compared the starvation behavior of the newly enriched ammonia oxidizer G5-7 to that of N. europaea. The growth experiment at low ammonium concentrations showed that strain G5-7 was able to outcompete N. europaea at growth-limiting substrate concentrations of about 10 muM ammonium, suggesting better growth abilities of the ammonia oxidizer G5-7 at low ammonium concentrations. However, N. europaea displayed a more favorable starvation response. After 1 to 10 weeks of ammonium deprivation, N. europaea became almost immediately active after the addition of fresh ammonium and converted the added ammonium within 48 to 96 h. In contrast, the regeneration time of the ammonia oxidizer G5-7 increased with increasing starvation time. Taken together, these results provide insight into possible mechanisms of niche differentiation for the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria studied. The Nitrosomonas cluster 6a member, G5-7, is able to grow at ammonium concentrations at which the growth of N. europaea, belonging to Nitrosomonas cluster 7, has already ceased, providing an advantage in habitats with continuously low ammonium concentrations. On the other hand, the ability of N. europaea to become active again after longer periods of starvation for ammonium may allow better exploitation of irregular pulses of ammonium in the environment.","2002",NA,"10.1128/AEM.68.10.4751-4757.2002","WOS:000178380900007"

"Engelhardt, KAM; Ritchie, ME","The effect of aquatic plant species richness on wetland ecosystem processes","ECOLOGY","Rapid environmental changes have fostered debates and motivated research on how to effectively preserve or restore ecosystem processes. One such debate deals with the effects of biodiversity, and the loss thereof, on ecosystem processes. Recent studies demonstrate that resource-use complementarity, now known as the niche-differentiation effect, and the presence of a competitive species with strong effects on ecosystem processes, now known as the sampling effect, can explain why productivity and nutrient retention are sometimes enhanced with increasing species richness. In a well-replicated outdoor mesocosm experiment, we tested these and other alternative mechanisms that could explain the effects of submersed aquatic plant (macrophyte) diversity on wetland ecosystem processes. Algal biomass increased and phosphorus loss decreased as species richness increased. This result can best be explained by an indirect sampling effect caused by one of the weakest competitors, which appeared to facilitate algal growth and thereby filtering of particles, and thus phosphorus, from the water column. The dominant competitor also appeared to decrease phosphorus loss through direct effects on phosphorus availability in the soil and water. Thus, the effects by one of the weakest and the most dominant competitors combine to produce a diversity effect on phosphorus loss. Macrophyte biomass was not enhanced, but converged toward the intermediate biomass of the most competitive species. Such an inverse sampling effect may be produced when the most competitive species is not the most productive species owing to species-specific feedbacks and adaptations to the wetland environment. In summary, we reject the niche-differentiation effect as the dominant mechanism in our macrophyte communities and expand on the role of sampling effects in explaining the relationship between plant communities and ecosystem processes. In particular, indirect and inverse sampling effects combine to drive the relationship between species richness and wetland ecosystem processes. Thus, we demonstrate that plant diversity may affect wetland ecosystem processes when inferior competitors drive system productivity and nutrient retention. To ensure coexistence of such species with superior competitors, wetland systems may need to be maintained in a nonequilibrium state, such as with hydrologic disturbances, which would maintain both higher diversity and enhance ecosystem functioning.","2002",NA,NA,"WOS:000179348800023"

At present, there exist no industry-wide sampling and testing protocols for compost products, thus limiting the production sector. The objective of this research was to test three methods for determining compost maturity. The study followed the composting process of a locally successful commercial composting operation that had been producing lime-stabilised,biosolids compost in the Washington, DC metro region for 12 yr. Change over time in the dependent variables-Dewar flask self-beating capacity, oxygen uptake rate, and cation exchange capacity (CEC)-during a 57-d composting of lime-stabilized biosolids was studied. Because cold storage at 4degreesC is recommended when compost samples cannot be tested for maturity immediately, cold storage of up to 11 wk was included as a variable. Mathematical models were developed that predict change in the Dewar flask self-beating capacity, oxygen uptake rate, and CEC with composting time and storage at 4degreesC. The Dewar flask self-heating test was the most useful indicator of compost maturity. This test showed change throughout the 57-d biosolids composting period while oxygen respirometry did not change after 29 d. The CEC was found to increase with age and, storage. Storage effects varied for the different tests. Except for Days I and 57, composts continued to stabilize during storage.

Escherichia coli cells and Bacillus subtilis spores were generated by a Collison three-jet nebulizer. Bioaerosol samples were collected by three sampling methods, AGI-30 impingers, Nuclepore filtration and elution methods, and gelatin filters. Effects of storage time was determined by the ratio, C-t/C-0, where C-t and C-0 were the CFU concentrations of the simultaneously collected samples stored for t and 0 h, respectively. The effect of storage temperature was also studied for AGI-30 samples stored at 25 and 4 degreesC. For impinger samples, it was demonstrated that the bioefficiency of bacterial bioaerosols could survive in the impinger fluid, and even bud more cells at room temperature. In addition, the inhibition effect of refrigerated samples was observed. Therefore, we suggest that samples collected by an impingement method should be refrigerated and processed as soon as possible to avoid the increase of bacterial culturability. Moreover, the effect of storage time on filtration collection for B. subtilis spores was demonstrated to be insignificant. However, E. coli recovery from filters was demonstrated to decrease as storage time increased. It was concluded that the recovery would not decrease during storage if bioefficiencies of the sampling methods were excellent, for example, using filters to collect B. subtilis spores or impingers to collect E. coli cells.

However, sample preservation is sometimes necessary, especially for scientific research purposes. There is little information available on the effects of sample storage on compost stability and maturity. Samples of biosolids compost with different levels of stability and maturity were collected from tour compost facilities in Florida (referred to as Register, Winslow, Sunset, and Meadow). Comparisons of CO2 evolution, seed germination rate, and water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) were made between fresh samples with short storage at 4 degreesC for less than 1 wk and air-dried or frozen compost samples stored for 1 yr, The effects of storage (air-dry or frozen) on the measured parameters depended on compost stability and maturity and on the compost material source. Frozen storage reduced the peak CO2 evolution of Register samples by 12 to 29%, while accumulated CO2 evolution was reduced by 43 to 64% and 110 to 277% with air-dry and frozen storage, respectively, The storage effect on CO2 evolution with more stable compost was inconsistent. Storage did not affect compost phytotoxicity, except for samples from the Sunset facility. Air-drying reduced the WSOC by up to 35%, and freezing increased it by up to 34%, while both storage methods had no significant effect on samples of low WSOC, Despite all these variations, WSOC had a significant and consistent relation to CO2 evolution and seed germination rates with R-2 of 0.78 and 0.57, respectively, regardless of storage methods.","2001",NA,"10.2134/jeq2001.301222x","WOS:000166649400028"

Using a model (PROTECH-C) that simulates the simultaneous daily growth of eight phytoplankton species, the following hypotheses were tested: (i) for each given set of simulated conditions, the species with the most appropriate trait, as predicted by a functional group classification, should dominate the community; (ii) with removal of this dominant species, the next best-adapted species should dominate and should be from the same, or a close, functional group where available; (iii) a reduction in the inoculum size of the initially dominant species will not prevent its eventual dominance of the community. 2. For clearer insight into the mechanisms underlying these community processes, a functional group classification based upon species morphology has been used to produce a matrix analogous to Grime's CSR (C, competitor; S, stress tolerator; R, ruderal) paradigm. The effects upon this phytoplankton community of temperature, grazing, limiting light and nutrients over a simulated year were recorded. 3. The results supported all three hypotheses. It was found that, for a given selective constraint, functional traits provided excellent predictors of the dominant types. Also, under conditions of resource competition, the number of functional groups represented decreased. Competition was greatest within functional groups where niche overlap was high, but one species was always clearly the strongest competitor, i.e. its superiority over its nearest functional competitor was regularly expressed even when the difference in inoculum size was great (1000-fold). These conclusions emphasized the power that trait selection can have in the shaping of communities.","2001",NA,"10.1046/j.1365-2427.2001.00629.x","WOS:000166759200009"

In addition, no back mutation to obtain a maximal complexity (i.e. lambda -resistant and sensitive species coexistence) or original ecology (i.e. original lambda -lysogen) for the evolution occurs.

I collected dietary data during a first yearlong comparative study, of wild groups of Callimico goeldii, Saguinus labiatus and S. fuscicollis. Dietary overlap, was highest between Saguinus fuscicollis and Saguinus labiatus throughout the year, and lowest between Saguinus labiatus and Callimico goeldii. All three species had high dietary overlap in February, and March when a few abundant fruit species dominated their diets. Although all three species rely heavily, on many, of the same fruits and arthropods, there are several important distinctions among their diets. Surprisingly, Callimico goeldii consume large quantities of fungus throughout the year: 29% of annual feeding records. Mycophagy is more frequent in the dry season when fruits are scarce. In contrast, Saguinus labiatus rarely eat fungus during the period of fruit scarcity, and instead rely, on nectar, a resource never exploited by, Callimico goeldii. Saguinus fuscicollis also rely on nectar during periods of low fruit availability, and increase their intake of arthropods and exudates. During April, a period of fruit scarcity, exudates comprise > 50% of the feeding records of Saguinus fuscicollis. The use of different food resources during fruit scarcity, and differences in the heights at which each species feeds and forages appear to define a distinct ecological niche for each of them and allow them to maintain long-term associations throughout the year. Furthermore, I hypothesize that the limited distribution of Callimico goeldii may, result from their restriction to forests that have high disturbance rates, where microhabitats appropriate for fungal growth are abundant, but which also contain abundant fruit and insects.","2001",NA,"10.1023/A:1012013621258","WOS:000172226000005"
"Harrison, SSC; Hildrew, AG","Epilithic communities and habitat heterogeneity in a lake littoral","JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY","1. Stones along the shore of a eutrophic English lake in summer have one of two epilithic assemblages. Many stones are covered with dense filaments of the macro-alga Cladophora glomerata and the tubes of detritivorous/browsing chironomids, Others have few algal filaments and are dominated by gallery-building caddis larvae (Tinodes waeneri). These communities are patchily distributed along the shore, macro-algae dominating in areas away from riparian trees and on tall, rather than flat stones. The origins of this dichotomy were assessed in a field experiment that provided new surfaces for colonization, according to a planned schedule in time and space. 2. To examine temporal heterogeneity, artificial substrata (clay tiles) were introduced into the littoral each month from February to October 1995 and harvested on several occasions from 1 to 9 months later. 'Large' scale spatial heterogeneity was investigated by introducing tiles into three locations along the shore that differed with respect to shoreline trees. At a smaller scale, tiles were introduced with varying degrees of accessibility to dispersing insect larvae by placing them directly on the lake bed, above the bed on platforms, or as stacks of several tiles (to mimic tall stones). 3. There was a distinct temporal separation in the colonization of invertebrates, with tube-building chironomid larvae dominating substrata in spring, before being displaced by Tinodes in summer. A strong temporal pattern in algal productivity, with spring and autumn maxima and a summer minimum, was attributable to nutrient limitation in summer. 4. In summer, there was a strong spatial separation of organisms at large and small scales. In patches under or near trees, chironomids and Cladophora were replaced by Tinodes larvae. Cladophora remained abundant away from trees, where tiles were never colonized by the crawling Tinodes larvae, originating from egg masses laid beneath trees. Areas distant from oviposition sites may act as a grazing refugium for Cladophora and its associated chironomids. At a smaller scale, the inability of Tinodes to colonize the upper surfaces of tall stones also created spatial refugia for algae and chironomids, even within patches of generally high Tinodes density. 5. There was also evidence of a temporal grazing refugium for Cladophora. Cladophora filaments which colonized tiles introduced in April subsequently resisted grazing by Tinodes newly recruiting in June. Filaments colonizing tiles introduced before or after April, however, were vulnerable to Tinodes. The precise mechanism for this is unclear, however. 6. Spatiotemporal patterns in the epilithic community were caused by the external factors of a seasonally fluctuating nutrient supply and a patchy riparian strip of trees and the intrinsic factors of habitat choice, and the life history phenology of the organisms concerned. Our results infer strong direct biotic interactions among species( particularly grazing of Cladophora by Tinodes), indirect interactions between Tinodes and several chironomids via habitat engineering (i.e. the removal of Cladophora as chironomid habitat) and the crucial role of spatiotemporal heterogeneity in decoupling those interactions.","2001",NA,"10.1046/j.1365-2656.2001.00529.x","WOS:000170005700016"

The results suggest that periphyton growth within a cell was negatively affected by the biomass of periphyton in the cell but was positively affected by the biomass of periphyton in neighboring cells. A semivariogram analysis indicated that spatial heterogeneity increased with increasing grazing pressure. The size of patches was not clearly related to the number of snails, but there was a tendency for relative patch size to increase with snail density. Computer simulations were also conducted to examine factors affecting the degree of spatial heterogeneity. The simulation studies indicated that snails should graze a site that was previously grazed in order to produce the observed spatial heterogeneity of periphyton. The results also indicated that the positive effects of neighboring periphyton on the growth of algae might create patches. The interactions among neighboring algae and snail grazing might be an important factor creating the spatial heterogeneity of periphyton even on homogeneous substrates.","2001",NA,"10.1034/j.1600-0706.2001.920302.x","WOS:000168018000002"
"Elena, SF","Evolutionary history conditions the timing of transmission in vesicular stomatitis virus","INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION","It has been postulated that early transmitted viruses would evolve to be more virulent than late transmitted ones. The reason for this prediction is that early transmission selects for rapid viral replication and, consequently, rapid host death, whereas late transmission would select for slow-replicating viruses that permit longer survival to the host. To test this prediction, experimental lineages of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) had been adapted to three different transmission dynamics during more than 100 generations. Transmission dynamic differed in the stage of infection at which transmission took place: early, intermediate or late. Regardless the timing of transmission imposed during the competition experiments done for estimating fitness, lineages adapted to an intermediate time of transmission reached higher fitness than viruses adapted to either early or late transmission. Viruses adapted to early and late transmission schedules showed a trade-off in their performance at other transmission times, with higher fitness at their own transmission time than at any other. The basis of fitness differences, in terms of growth parameters, have also been explored. Fitness correlated with the rate of growth and with the moment of maximum population density but not with the maximum density itself. In addition, a positive correlation between virus performance at late transmission and stability outside the cellular host has been detected. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

"Anderies, JM; Beisner, BE","Fluctuating environments and phytoplankton community structure: A stochastic model","AMERICAN NATURALIST","Spatial heterogeneity in organism and resource distributions can generate temporal heterogeneity in resource access for simple organisms like phytoplankton. The role of temporal heterogeneity as a structuring force for simple communities is investigated via models of phytoplankton with contrasting life histories competing for a single fluctuating resource. A stochastic model in which environmental and demographic stochasticity are treated separately is compared with a model with deterministic resource variation to assess the importance of stochasticity. When compared with the deterministic model, the stochastic model allows for coexistence over a wider range of parameter values (or life-history types). The model suggests that demographic stochasticity alone is far more important in increasing the possibility of coexistence than environmental stochasticity alone. However, the combined effects of both types of stochasticity produce the largest likelihood of coexistence. Finally, the influence of relative nutrient levels and nutrient pulse frequency on these results is addressed. We relate our findings to variable environment theory with evidence for both relative nonlinearity and the storage effect acting in this model. We show for the first time that temporal dynamics generated by demographic stochasticity may operate like the storage effect at particular spatial scales.","2000",NA,"10.1086/303336","WOS:000086736300010"

The aim of this study was to identify the fundamental niche of both species in their natural habitat, and to investigate the relative importance of food and abiotic factors in determining presence and success of nematode species in the highly dynamic estuarine tidal environments of macrophyte detrital habitats. Of the three factors studied, salinity least impacted P. marina and D, meyli. Respiration and assimilation in both species showed only minor variation in the salinity range of 10 to 30 parts per thousand. Respiration decreased at marine salinities in P. marina, and increased in both species at oligohaline salinities down to a stress-induced maximum around a salinity of 5 parts per thousand, then steeply declined towards freshwater conditions. Temperature heavily affected both species, but Q(10)-values in D. meyli were considerably higher than in P. marina, suggesting the former species to be particularly well adapted to fine-tuning its energy expenditure as a function of temperature. The highest respiration and assimilation rates in both species were at 25 degrees C. At still higher temperatures, metabolic rates were depressed, but while P. marina was entirely inactivated above 30 degrees C, D. meyli continued to respire and assimilate food up to 35 degrees C. The scope for production, calculated as the net difference between assimilation and respiration rates (both expressed in units of C), was 0 at 5 degrees C and increased to a maximum at 25 degrees C in both nematodes; it declined at higher temperatures, but remained positive up to 35 degrees C in D. meyli. Significant food assimilation in both nematodes occurred only at bacterial densities above 10(8) cells ml(-1). Assimilation rate reached a maximum at 5 x 10(8) cells ml(-1) in D. meyli, and remained constant at higher densities. P. marina, by contrast, had a well defined peak assimilation at a food density of 2.5 x 10(9) cells ml(-1), with lower rates at both lower and higher food densities. This contrasts with observations on ingestion rate, and suggests a food density-dependent assimilation efficiency. The present results suggest that tolerances of exposure to salinity and temperature extremes on a daily rather than seasonal basis, may be of higher significance in niche differentiation between both species. Their fundamental niche further appears to be determined by the range of (near) optimal food conditions, which is narrow in P. marina but comparatively broader in D. meyli.

However, temperature development and fungal growth in the pellet piles have been observed at some plants. Documented knowledge of the storage of pellets is limited. In this pilot study, nine pellet assortments, made on a large scale of fresh and stored sawdust, bark and logging residues (a mixture of Norway spruce and Scots pine) were tested for changes in moisture content, heating value and ash content. Dimensions, bulk density, density of individual pellets and durability were also determined. The process variables were constant during pelleting. The five months storage has done in plastic bags (1.3 m(3)) in an unheated barn. The storage led to negative effects on durability, especially on pellets made of fresh materials. Pellets made out of fresh logging residues were found to have lowest durability after storage. The average length was decreased due to breakage during storage. Microbial growth was noticed in some of the pellet assortments. Water absorption tests showed the largest hygroscopicity of the pellets from fresh materials. Ln general, the changes in pellet quality during storage in large bags were not large, but notable. The tendency to reach the equilibrium with the ambient moisture content should be taken into consideration during production if the pellets are to be stored. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this model, nutrients were classified into dissolved and particulate matter, and bacteria use not only particulate nutrient but also dissolved nutrient. We led the sufficient conditions of permanence in the model system. On the basis of these conditions, we studied how they can achieve the coexistence estimating indirect effects between phytoplankton and bacteria through nutrients, and argued the effects of nutrient recycling through bacterial decomposition on the coexistence. From these analysis, we obtained that coexistence conditions can be explained by invasion conditions, and coexistence can be achieved even if bacteria cannot always invade the steady state consisting of only two types of nutrient. The estimation of indirect effects indicated the mutualistic interactions between phytoplankton and bacteria under the conditions of permanence. This suggests that mutualistic situation will be occurred by nutrient recycling after sufficiently long time, even if phytoplankton and bacteria compete with each other through common resource initially.

By studying the effect of the length of 3'-untranslated region (UTR) on mRNA levels, we have found that alpha-globin pre-mRNA is stabilized by a mechanism that does not modulate the half-life of mature mRNA. The insertion of DNA fragments of various unrelated sequences into the 3'-UTR of the human alpha-globin gene strongly reduces mRNA abundance upon transfection into choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells. We found an inverse relationship between mRNA levels and the length of the introduced fragments. In fact, mRNA levels as low as 1% were observed after inserting a 477-nucleotide (nt) fragment, whereas inserting a fragment of 86 nt at the same position had no effect on mRNA accumulation. DNA insertion induced no change in transcription rate or in half-life of mature mRNA. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that inserting a 477-nt fragment in the 3'-UTR resulted in decreased levels of nuclear pre-mRNA in proportion to that observed for mature mRNA. In contrast, the insertion of the 477-nt exogenous DNA in the last intron had no effect on mRNA levels despite the presence of intronic sequences in the pre-mRNA. This shows that the reduction of pre-mRNA level was not due to the insertion of putative ribonuclease cleavage sites or the insertion of a segment DNA that reduces the elongation efficiency. Taken together, our results strongly support the existence of a pre-mRNA stabilizing mechanism that can be disrupted by increasing the length of the 3'-UTR. The fact that the half-life of mature mRNA is not affected by DNA insertion is compatible with a pre-mRNA-specific stabilizing mechanism that acts specifically before polyadenylation.","2000",NA,"10.1074/jbc.M002969200","WOS:000089577900047"

We instead present a model built from experimental data on the gypsy moth and its nuclear polyhedrosis virus, which has been extensively tested with epidemic data. These data have identified key details of the gypsy moth-virus interaction that are missing from earlier models, including seasonality in host reproduction, delays between host infection and death, and heterogeneity among hosts in their susceptibility to the virus. Allowing for these details produces models in which annual epidemics are followed by bouts of reproduction among surviving hosts and leads to quite different conclusions than earlier models. First, these models suggest that pathogen-driven outbreaks in forest defoliators occur partly because newly hatched insect larvae have higher average susceptibility than do older larvae. Second, the models show that a combination of seasonality and delays between infection and death can lead to unstable cycles in the absence of a stabilizing mechanism; these cycles, however, are stabilized by the levels of heterogeneity in susceptibility that we have observed in our experimental data. Moreover, our experimental estimates of virus transmission rates and levels of heterogeneity in susceptibility in gypsy moth populations give model dynamics that closely approximate the dynamics of real gypsy moth populations. Although we built our models from data for gypsy moth, our models are, nevertheless, quite general. Our conclusions are therefore likely to be true, not just for other defoliator-pathogen interactions, but for many host-pathogen interactions in which seasonality plays an important role. Our models thus give qualitative insight into the dynamics of host-pathogen interactions, while providing a quantitative interpretation of our gypsy moth-virus data.","2000",NA,"10.1086/303379","WOS:000088212200001"

Recent developments in the field of chaotic advection in hydrodynamical flows encourage us to revisit the population dynamics of species competing for the same resource in an open aquatic system. If this aquatic environment is homogeneous and well-mixed then classical studies predict competitive exclusion of all but the most perfectly adapted species. In fact, this homogeneity is very rare, and the species of the community (at least on an ecological observation time scale) are in nonequilibrium coexistence. We argue that a peculiar small-scale, spatial heterogeneity generated by chaotic advection can lead to coexistence. In open flows this imperfect mixing lets the populations accumulate along fractal filaments, where competition is governed by an advantage of rarity principle. The possibility of this generic coexistence sheds light on the enrichment of phytoplankton and the information integration in early macromolecule evolution.","2000",NA,"10.1073/pnas.240242797","WOS:000165728800039"

Laboratory rearings showed that these microcaddisflies displayed similar life cycles and exhibited hypermetamorphosis. H. consimilis mandibles are specialized for piercing individual cells within filaments of Cladophora to facilitate removal of cellular contents, whereas Ochrotrichia spp. have robustly cusped mandibles suited for piercing Cladophora and scraping diatoms from benthic substrates. Proportional similarity, analysis of videotaped behavior illustrated that the feeding habits of third-instar Ochrotrichia exhibited a low similarity (0.44) to the other instars tested (Ochrotrichia fifth and Hydroptila first, third, and fifth) because of their frequent consumption of diatoms (17% of feeding efforts); all other instars tested. were highly similar to each other (0.72- 0.86). This division of trophic resources (i.e., differential use of diatoms versus Cladophora) minimized niche overlap between the two genera. All instars of H. consimilis and Ochrotrichia spp. fed, heavily on the apical (therefore the smallest) cells of Cladophora filaments, and the time required to consume cells decreased significantly as larvae matured (P < 0.05). Larval Hydroptilidae are well adapted morphologically and behaviorally to consume Cladophora, anti these algal filaments appear to represent a heterogeneous food source just as terrestrial host plants are for the array of phytophagous insects that use them.","2000",NA,"10.1603/0013-8746(2000)093[0225:BALFHO]2.0.CO;2","WOS:000089631800008"

If compared to literature data, the growth was rather fast but varied between the years; possibly the lack of young age classes led to differences in density dependent factors influencing the growth. After appearance in spring the fish behaved stationary with only single mobile individuals. During this period, the distribution at the shore was very irregular. In autumn the animals disappeared from the shallow shore area. The fish fed exclusively upon benthic organisms and showed a special size spectrum of ingested items. No differences between the genetic forms concerning the investigated aspects were found.

The farm pond experienced lower maximum temperatures than a nearby dune pond but sustained larger numbers of eukaryotic algae and therefore had higher primary productivity. Survival and growth of B. calamita larvae were inversely related to density in all treatments but interspecific effects were much more severe than intraspecific ones. There was no evidence of A. richardsi in any treatment and competition between the Bufo larvae was therefore intense in the absence of Anurofeca-mediated interference effects. Anuran larvae reduced the standing crop and altered the community composition of algae in the treatment cages but larval growth rates were not simply related to food availability. Algal cell numbers in larval guts, a measure of food acquisition, were however inversely related to tadpole density in both species.

It provides diverse microhabitats (allowing resource partitioning), and presents these in a complex mosaic, such that competitors may be spatially and temporally separated (promoting patch dynamics). The objective of our study was to assess the importance of patch dynamics for the maintenance of landscape-level nematode diversity. The spatiotemporal aggregation patterns in populations of five species of the bacterivorous genus Chronogaster were analyzed for a 0.7-ha riparian wetland, during four seasons, using geostatistical methods (spatiotemporal variograms, cross-correlograms, and log-normal kriging). We found that for the three most abundant species, aggregation was significant over distances of 13-39 m, with intraspecific aggregation stronger than interspecific aggregation. In addition, species patterns appeared to be temporally dynamic: local population declines alternated with local blooms at different sites and seasons. One species was consistently present at the same few sites, but the other species showed gradual temporal decreases and increases at different locations in the wetland. Combining nematode patterns with information on soil resource distributions and Chronogaster ecology, indicated that both soil resource patchiness and repeated, but largely unpredictable, disturbances caused by local soil moisture fluctuations could promote landscape-level Chronogaster diversity by providing ample 'probability refuges.' Local species populations, reduced by competition, predation and draught, could recolonize patches either through the awakening of local dormant 'seed populations,' or through limited passive dispersal by wind, water, and phoresis. We suggest that the spatiotemporal Chronogaster data provide preliminary evidence for the importance of patch dynamics in maintaining soil nematode diversity.","2000",NA,"10.1007/s004420000468","WOS:000165442700016"
"Roberts, D; Gebruk, A; Levin, V; Manship, BAD","Feeding and digestive strategies in deposit-feeding holothurians","OCEANOGRAPHY AND MARINE BIOLOGY, VOL 38","Deposit-feeding holothurians employ a range of feeding and digestive strategies depending on the Particular environment to which they are adapted. Habitat and feeding specialisation is reflected in the tentacles, which show high diversity. Studies of tentacular ultrastructure in Aspidochirotida, Dendrochirotida, Apodida and Elasipodida have revealed a number of shared features. Tentacular layers include the mesothelium, which lines the ambulacral ducts, connective and neural tissues and the epithelial layer, which is covered by extracellular coats. Up to five cell types have been reported in the tentacle epithelium of the taxa studied. The capture of food particles involves contractile arid adhesive elements on the tentacle surface of dendritic, peltate and possibly other tentacle types and may involve selectivity, although the precise mechanisms involved are still poorly understood. Surface deposit-feeding holothurians show a high degree of dietary niche overlap on tropical reefs and in the deep sea. Where diverse suites of species coexist diversification probably results from trophic arid microhabitat specialisation. The digestive tract shows distinctive inter-ordinal and intra-ordinal differences in anatomy. The gut wall is layered and has ectodermal arid endodermal components. Epithelia in the pharynx, oesophagus, rectum and cloaca are characterised by T-shaped cells that are covered by a cuticle and are thought to be involved in the uptake of dissolved organic matter. Enterocytes, which characterise the intestine, lack a cuticle but have a filamentous coat and are involved in absorption and intracellular digestion, The role of subcuticular bacteria, evident in a number of studies. remains to be demonstrated. Deposit-feeding holothurians are broadly adapted to process large quantities of often nutrient-poor sediments from which they extract labile compounds. Some species may be able to utilise more refractory organic components of the sediment and bacteria may facilitate this utilisation. Shallow-water and abyssal deposit-feeding holothurians ha e broadly similar suites of enzymes involved in the hydrolysis of fatty acids, esters, glycosidic bonds and peptide bonds in terminal positions. Although deep-sea holothurians might be expected to be able to exploit refractory organic compounds, neither cellulase nor chitinase activity has yet been detected in the gut tissue of holothurians. However, the presence of cellobiase and chitobiase in the holothurian digestive tract suggests that they do have the potential to utilise the breakdown products of cellulose and chitin arid to digest bacterial membranes. Factors such as temperature, light intensity, food availability and physiological events affect ingestion rates arid gut residence tit-ties in deposit-feeding holothurians. The functional relationships between food quality, gut residence time and digestion reaction kinetics in detrivores, including holothurians, have been extensively modelled using chemical reactor theory. Deposit feeders should theoretically show plug-flow characteristics in which catalytic (enzymatic) digestion predominates and the majority of deposit-feeding holothurians probably conform to this model. Expanded regions of the gut can be modelled as mixing chambers that may facilitate enzymatic mixing of compact sediments or fermentation. Examples of taxa that have expanded gut chambers include molpadiids and the abyssal Psychropotes longicauda. The impact of holothurians on suspended and deposited particulates reflects feeding activities and lifestyles, Aspidochirotids and epibenthic apodids decrease the stability of the sediment Surface whereas dendrochirotids facilitate the accumulation of bound organic matter on the sediment surface, increasing stability and decreasing permeability of sediment. Burrowing deposit-feeding holothurians increase the vertical heterogeneity of the the sediment profile. Molpadiids and burrowing apodids make the micro- and mesorelief of the sea bottom more complicated, which may have either positive or negative effects on sediment stability. Variations in surface primary and detrital production influence the proportions of the major holothurian taxa and consequently their impact at different latitudes. In tropical and subtropical regions, where Aspidochirotida and epibenthic Apodida predominate, the major impact of holothurians is horizontal transport of surface sediments. In temperate regions. Dendrochirotida. Molpadiida and burrowing Apodida predominate. These taxa have major and diverse effects on the sediment surface, where they cause biodeposition and horizontal sediment transport, and in deeper sediments A here they cause bioturbation. In polar regions, the major impact of holothurians is through biosedimentation: horizontal transfer of sediments is absent, In the deep sea. suspension feeders are generally rare and the distribution of deposit feeders is influenced greatly by surface production. In eutrophic sites relatively high densities of surface deposit-feeding holothurians cause rapid lateral transfer and redistribution of material as it arrives on the sea floor. In oligotrophic sites, surface deposit-feeding holothurians are less common and their contribution to lateral sediment transfer is negligible.","2000",NA,NA,"WOS:000175213000005"

This fitness difference remains proportional to the actual replication rate realized in the particular experimental setup and hence cannot be extrapolated to other situations. Conversely, the conventional relative fitness (1 + s) should be more generic. We develop an approach to compute the generic relative fitness in conventional competition experiments. This involves an estimation of the total viral replication during the experiment and requires an estimate of the average lifetime of productively infected cells. The novel approach is illustrated by estimating the relative fitness, i.e., the relative replication rate, of a set of zidovudine-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type I variants.

Replicate populations of VSV were allowed to evolve for 100 generations on the original host (BHK cells), on either of two novel hosts (HeLa and MDCK cells), or in environments where the availability of novel hosts fluctuated in a predictable or random way. As expected, each experimental population showed a substantial fitness gain in its own environment, but those evolved on new hosts (constant or fluctuating) suffered reduced competitiveness on the original host, However, whereas evolution on one novel host negatively correlated with performance on the unselected novel host, adaptation in fluctuating environments led to fitness improvements in both novel habitats.","2000",NA,NA,"WOS:000165740100002"

We show that a drop in absolute viral fitness associated with the outgrowth of M184V results in a drop in viral load only in individuals with high CD4(+) counts, from whom we estimate the relative fitness of M184V in the presence of drug to be approximately 10% of that of the wild type prior to therapy. The timing of emergence of the M184V mutant varies widely between infected individuals. From analysis of the frequency of M184I and M184V mutants determined at multiple time points in seven individuals during lamivudine therapy, we estimated the fitness advantage of M184V over M184I during therapy to be approximately 23% on average. We have also estimated the average ratio of the frequencies of the two mutants prior to therapy to be 0.2:1, with a range from 0.12:1 to 0.33:1. We have found that the differences between individuals in the rate of evolution of lamivudine resistance arise due to genetic drift affecting the relative frequency of M184I and M184V prior to therapy. These results show that stochastic effects can be significant In HIV evolution, even when there is large fitness difference between mutant and wild-type variants.","2000",NA,"10.1128/JVI.74.14.6262-6268.2000","WOS:000087817900004"
"Pinhassi, J; Hagström, Å","Seasonal succession in marine bacterioplankton","AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY","Here we examine the seasonal distribution of marine bacterioplankton species in the northern Baltic Sea. The population density of different bacteria was determined by whole-genome DNA hybridization to community DNA. During spring, concomitant with the phytoplankton spring bloom and its decay, the bacterial community was dominated by 5 bacterial species belonging to the Flexibacter-Cytophaga-Bacteroides phylum. Together they accounted for up to 43 % of the intact cells as indicated by the number of nucleoid-containing cells at this time of year (20 % of the total bacterial counts). In late June a number of new bacteria proliferated to form a summer community. The dominant bacteria during summer were largely members of the alpha-Proteobacteria, with a significant contribution of Sphingomonas and Caulobacter species. The capacity of these species to cope with oligotrophic growth conditions may explain their success at this time of year, when low PO4 concentrations Limit bacterial growth. The different communities were reflected in the correlation between bacterial production and temperature. During summer significantly lower levels: of production at corresponding temperatures were found compared to spring and autumn. We suggest this to be a result of different physiological predisposition of the dominant bacteria during the respective seasons. A compilation of current research demonstrated the consistent finding of a low or moderate diversity in the marine environment. Thus, an understanding of how variability in physiological capacities among dominant bacterial groups results in niche differentiation is conceivable.","2000",NA,"10.3354/ame021245","WOS:000087813000004"

Algal cultures of different taxonomic groups and different size were offered as prey. In addition to observations of feeding, growth rate was used as a measure of the quality of the different prey for population maintenance. The two Protoperidinium species show some degree of food niche differentiation, with preference for different prey types. Protoperidinium pallidum showed a preference for diatoms over dinoflagellates, and only diatom prey was able to support population growth. The smaller P. steinii had positive population growth on both dinoflagellates and diatoms, bur the highest growth rate was supported by dinoflagellates, and P. steinii showed a preference for this prey type. A common feature of the Protoperidinium species was the failure of small flagellates to support growth. The third dinoflagellate, Z. lenticulatum, showed a preference for diatoms over dinoflagellates, although dinoflagellates and one small flagellate, in addition to diatoms, were able to support growth. Species from the Diplopsalis group can be regarded as generalists in feeding compared to Protoperidinium species, which show more specialization. The predator:prey size ratio yielding best growth was, in terms of equivalent sphere diameter, about 1:1 for P. pallidum and Z. lenticulatum and 2.3:1 for P. steinii.","2000",NA,"10.2216/i0031-8884-39-3-187.1","WOS:000089865000003"

The effects of various storage methods for particles collected on glass-fiber filters were examined using natural marine particles. Sensitivity to storage effects differed for particles collected from different environments, but results consistently indicated that refrigeration for more than a few hours and freezing at -10 degrees C are inadequate for preserving absorption by phytoplankton pigments in the visible region of the spectrum. Storage at -80 degrees C and at liquid-nitrogen temperatures was found to be satisfactory, with Liquid nitrogen providing the most reliable results for the longest periods evaluated (up to 1 yr). Increases in absorption were observed at ultraviolet wavelengths under all storage conditions, which suggests that optical properties in this region of the spectrum cannot be reliably assessed unless samples are analyzed immediately after collection.","1999",NA,"10.4319/lo.1999.44.4.1139","WOS:000082148200016"

The bacterium is able to reproduce saprophytically, though it competes for saprophytic substrates with non-pathogenic strains, which appear to be superior competitors, probably because they lack a plasmid that carries genes required for pathogenicity. The effect of saprophytism and competition on the invasion criterion (Ro), short-term dynamics and long-term dynamics are described. Saprophytism can reduce (possibly to zero) the host threshold at which the pathogen can invade, though this reduction is less when there is competition with non-pathogenic strains. In a model of short-term population dynamics designed to mimic the application of bacteria to a host epizootic, saprophytism enhances the reduction in host density though again this is tempered by competition with non-pathogens. In the long term, a pathogen that can develop saprophytically can drive its host to extinction in the absence of competition with non-pathogens. When the latter are present, host extinction is prevented. The addition of saprophytic reproduction can stabilize an otherwise unstable host-pathogen model, but we were unable to find a stable equilibrium given the further addition of a wholly saprophytic bacterial strain. The model suggests that enhancing or selecting for saprophytic ability could be a way of improving biological control.","1999",NA,"10.1098/rspb.1999.0627","WOS:000078573000003"

The ciliary beat frequency of human nasal respiratory epithelium, obtained by nasal brushing of healthy volunteers, was measured using a photo-transistor technique, while superoxide generation by activated human PMNL and membrane-stabilizing activity were measured by lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence and haemolytic procedures, respectively. All three PL, at concentrations of 2.5 mu g.mL(-1), caused significant (p<0.005) ciliary slowing and epithelial damage, while treatment of the epithelial strips with the ketolides, in particular HMR 3004, caused dose-related attenuation of these direct adverse effects of the PL on ciliated epithelium, apparently by a membrane-stabilizing mechanism. When epithelial strips were exposed to the combination of PMNL (1 x 10(6) cells.mL(-1)) and PAF (1 mu g.mL(-1)), significant ciliary dysfunction and epithelial damage were also observed, which were mediated predominantly by neutrophil-derived oxidants. These injurious effects of PAF were antagonized by preincubation of the epithelial strips or the PMNL with HMR 3004 (10 mu g.mL(-1)). The ketolide antimicrobial agents, in particular HMR 3004, antagonize the direct and polymorphonuclear leukocyte-mediated injurious effects of phospholipids on human ciliated epithelium and may have beneficial effects in inflammatory disorders of the airways, such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, diffuse panbronchiolitis and bronchiectasis.","1999",NA,"10.1034/j.1399-3003.1999.13e15.x","WOS:000080926700015"

In nature, various mechanisms that provide some refuges for inferior species to escape from competition act together to promote the species coexistence in a local community. We propose a method to evaluate simultaneously the relative importance of different mechanisms for the species coexistence, focusing on a mycophagous drosophilid community depending on a multispecies fungal host system, where two mechanisms - aggregation over patches of single fungal species and resource partitioning at the fungal species level - can act together. The data are based on the numbers of adult insects emerging from naturally occurring fungi collected from a temperate forest in northern Japan. 2. We confirm the finding of Sevenster & van Alphen (1996) that large patches are low-density refuges despite the large absolute numbers of competitors on them, and therefore adopt new measures for intra- and interspecific aggregations and the species-persistence criterion, which were developed by Sevenster (1996) to take account of variable patch sizes in calculating the aggregation measures. 3. The calculated measures an compared among three analyses for fungal resources: AR-analysis (the original data-set from multispecies fungal patches) in which both aggregation and resource partitioning can act together; R-analysis (combining the data for all patches of each fungal species) in which only resource partitioning at the fungal species level can act; and A-analysis (calculating the measures independently for each fungal species) in which only aggregation process can act as a coexistence mechanism. 4. Intraspecific aggregation over multispecies fungal patches is strengthened by both aggregation and resource partitioning processes. 5. We reconfirm the finding of Sevenster & van Alphen (1996) that interspecific associations are consistent over years, and support their claim that such consistent associations should be taken as real aspects of the community structure. 6. Measures for the persistence criterion (T), the 'relative effect of competitor aggregation', are less than unity, satisfying the necessary and sufficient condition for the species persistence, in most drosophilid species concerned; these tend to be smaller in AR-analysis than in R- or A-analysis, suggesting facilitation of the species coexistence by both aggregation and resource partitioning in the mycophagous drosophilid community studied. 7. Differences in T-value between AR- and R-analyses and between AR- and A-analyses may indicate relative contributions of aggregation and resource partitioning, respectively, to the species coexistence. We propose a method to compare various communities in a multi-dimensional space with regard to the relative importance of different coexistence mechanisms.","1999",NA,"10.1046/j.1365-2656.1999.00328.x","WOS:000081723300014"

Larger males were always recorded within activity areas into which they allow females and smaller males but exclude males of the same size, which probably compete for females.

The objective of this study was to determine how interspecific competition, mycorrhizal symbiosis, and their interactions influence plant community structure. We conducted a factorial experiment, which incorporated manipulations of abundance of dominant competitors, Andropogon gerardii and Sorghastrum nutans, and suppression of mycorrhizal symbiosis using the fungicide benomyl under two fire regimes (annual and 4-year burn intervals). Removal of the two dominant C-4 grass species altered the community structure, increased plant species richness, diversity, and evenness, and increased abundance of subdominant graminoid and forb species. Suppression of mycorrhizal fungi resulted in smaller shifts in community structure, although plant species richness and diversity increased. Responses of individual plant species were associated with their degree of mycorrhizal responsiveness: highly mycorrhizal responsive species decreased in abundance and less mycorrhizal responsive species increased in abundance. The combination of dominant-grass removal and mycorrhizal suppression treatments interacted to increase synergistically the abundance of several species, indicating that both processes influence species interactions and community organization in tallgrass prairie. These results provide evidence that mycorrhizal fungi affect plant communities indirectly by influencing the pattern and strength of plant competitive interactions. Burning strongly influenced the outcome of these interactions, which suggests that plant species diversity in tallgrass prairie is influenced by a complex array of interacting processes, including both competition and mycorrhizal symbiosis.","1999",NA,"10.1007/s004420050964","WOS:000084728300015"

How so many species can coexist is still unknown. 2, Adult males of the majority of these species hold permanent territories which form dense multispecies mosaics across the shores. 3. The study examined six coexisting species of cichlids from the rocky habitat where males are known to control access to the algal food resources within their territorial space. These included four sibling species of the Pseudotropheus (Tropheops) species complex, which are specialized epilithic algal herbivores, and two sibling species of the trophically more generalist P. (Maylandia) species complex which feed upon both epilithic algae and plankton. 4. The hypotheses that both intraspecific and interspecific territoriality occur in these communities and that interspecific aggression initiated by territorial males is preferentially directed at species with the most similar diets to their own were tested. 5. It was found that males preferred to exclude conspecific intruders, while they tolerated intruders with different diets to their own. Also, male P. (Tropheops) preferentially excluded similar heterospecific dietary specialists, while male P. (Maylandia) tolerated similar heterospecific dietary generalists. 6. Based on this study, it is proposed that interspecific territoriality may be reducing competition between species with different diets and promoting their coexistence, while it may be enhancing competition between species with the same diet. Furthermore, it suggests that ecological generalism may be reducing the intensity of interspecific competition, while specializations for the same resources may be increasing competition.","1999",NA,"10.1046/j.1365-2656.1999.00301.x","WOS:000081723100008"

The results also showed, although less clearly, that fitness differences among quasispecies decreased with the magnitude of migration.

In some organisms, both the haploid and diploid phases undergo somatic development and exist as independent entities. Despite recent attention, the mechanisms by which such biphasic life cycles evolve and persist remain obscure. One explanation that has received little theoretical attention is that haploid-diploid organisms may exploit their environments more efficiently through niche differentiation of the two ploidy phases. Even in isomorphic species, in which adults are morphologically similar, slight differences in the adult phase or among juveniles may play an important ecological role and help maintain haploid-diploidy. We develop a genetic model for the evolution of life cycles that incorporates density-dependent growth. We find that ecological differences between haploid and diploid phases can lead to the evolution and maintenance of biphasic life cycles under a broad range of conditions. Parameter estimates derived from demographic data on a population of Gracilaria gracilis, a haploid-diploid red alga with an isomorphic alternation of generations, are used to demonstrate that an ecological explanation for haploid-diploidy is plausible even when there are only slight morphological differences among adults.","1999",NA,"10.1086/303241","WOS:000083467700005"

Many groups of invertebrates feed on subterranean plant parts, but insects and nematodes are the most important below-ground herbivores. Studies of interactions between below-ground herbivores have shown both competition and facilitation. Competition may be minimized through niche differentiation or by temporal or spatial avoidance. Studies have shown low levels of niche occupancy and no clear evidence for exclusive guilds or species packing. Facilitation may occur through substrate modification or the increased attractiveness of damaged roots to other herbivores. Specialist herbivores cause changes in plant community composition through their effects on specific host plants primarily as a result of the alteration of competitive interactions between coexisting plant species. Generalist herbivores can similarly affect plant community composition as a result of differences in their preference for plant species or differences in host plant susceptibility. Experimental studies have demonstrated the impact of below-ground herbivory on the rate and direction of vegetation succession, with belowground herbivores acting as keystone species in certain ecosystems. As a result of the focus of research on pest species or potential biological control agents, research has tended to focus on particular herbivore species and the effects on their host plant. This review shows that the role of below-ground herbivory in structuring plant communities and the interactions between such herbivores and other components of the biotic and physical environment of the soil remain important and fruitful areas for ecological research.","1999",NA,NA,"WOS:000081339000007"

The urea and ammonia treatments do not appear to offset the quality deterioration of the cottons by the 30% high moisture content, although both sugar content and stickiness are reduced.

Similar measurements were made in trees of native species growing in a nearby plantation after severe perturbation (clear cutting, mechanical soil disturbance). Bulk soil delta(15)N was spatially quite uniform in the forest (range 3-5%), whereas average leaf delta(15)N ranged from -0.3% to 3.5% in the different species. Three species only, Diplotropis purpurea, Recordoxylon speciosum (Fabaceae), and sclerolobium melinonii (Caesalpiniaceae), had root bacterial nodules, which was also associated with leaf N concentrations higher than 20 mg g(-1). Although nodulated trees displayed significantly lower leaf delta(15)N values than non-nodulated trees. leaf delta(15)N did not prove a straightforward indicator of symbiotic fixation, since there was a clear overlap of delta(15)N values for nodulated and non-nodulated species at the lower end of the delta(15)N range. Perturbation did not markedly affect the difference delta(15)N(soil) - delta(15)N(leaf), and thus the isotopic data provide no evidence of an alteration in the different N acquisition patterns. Extremely large interspecific differences in sunlit leaf delta(13)C were observed in the forest (average values from -31.4 to -26.7%), corresponding to intrinsic water-use efficiencies (ratio CO2 assimilation rate/leaf conductance for water vapour) varying over a threefold range. Wood cellulose delta(13)C was positively related to total leaf delta(13)C. the former values being 2-3% higher than the latter ones.

Year-to-year CHL fluctuations are quite similar in the Volga Reach and Main Part of the reservoir and depend upon hydrometeorological factors. Increases in the mean seasonal, most frequent and summer maximum CHL concentrations, demonstrate the accelerated eutrophication of the Main Part of the reservoir, which holds most of the total storage. Effects of water content, characterised in terms of total input, water level and water exchange intensity, are the most significant among hydrological factors. A clustering of years in fields of the first and second principal components corresponds to high-water periods (1969-1975) and low-water periods (since 1976). Strong influences of water content - controlled by human activity - on phytoplankton abundance (CHL) make it possible to provide ecosystem monitoring and management. Consideration is also given to the role of hydrological characteristics, including water balance, in producing undesirable changes that have occurred during recent yeats.","1998",NA,NA,"WOS:000076501300013"

Studies made on freshly collected soils are generally preferred but these are not always possible for practical reasons, since sampling is often restricted to short periods of the year, e.g. due to climatic conditions. The most commonly used methods to store soils for microbiological analyses are refrigeration or freezing of field moist soil. There are, however, studies that warn against any kind of storage, although other studies do not indicate any drawbacks to it. We have compared the microbial biomass and activities in 12 different, annually frozen, agricultural mineral soils when fresh and when stored at +2+/-2 degrees C and at -20+/-2 degrees C for 1 d and for 1, 3, 6 and 13 months. The results showed that the effects of freezing generally were smaller than those of refrigeration. The biomass estimated by chloroform fumigation-extraction and biomass index estimated by substrate induced respiration differed in that chloroform fumigation extracted carbon had decreased with 27% after 3 months at +2 degrees C, while substrate induced respiration showed only small deviations from the results from fresh soils. Basal respiration rate and potential denitrification activity showed a similar pattern, with a pronounced decrease in values for refrigerated soils. The nitrogen mineralisation capacity was the only measure that was greatly influenced by freezing. After 6 months N mineralisation in the frozen soils was 25% higher than that of the fresh soils. Potential ammonium oxidation and the degradation rate of the herbicide linuron were affected only a little or not at all by storage for 13 months. We concluded that storage at -20 degrees C for 13 months does not affect the microflora in annually frozen soils in any decisive way. We have also discussed the possible reasons for the contradictory results between different studies made on storage effects. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Forest soils were collected from near Mackenzie, Salmon Arm and Williams Lake, B.C. Soil microbial population sizes were evaluated using dilution plating. Carbon substrate utilization patterns were determined on fresh forest soils and after 32 weeks of storage at 4 degrees C and -10 degrees C using the Biolog system. Small aliquots of fresh and stored soils comprising <2% of seedling growth medium were also used in PGPR assays. The population sizes of viable soil microorganisms, particularly bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi, declined 10-1000 fold during soil storage at both temperatures. Differences in substrate utilization patterns-between soils and after storage treatments were also detected by Shannon's diversity index (H'), principal component analysis and cluster analysis of BIOLOG data. The three fresh soils formed a distinct cluster when plotted on ordination axes or by Euclidean distance. Williams Lake and Salmon Arm soils maintained a greater degree of substrate utilization diversity when stored frozen, but the opposite was true for Mackenzie soil. In general, the six PGPR strains had similar effects on spruce seedling growth within soil x storage treatments. Pseudomonas root colonization did not differ significantly between strains (Bacillus colonization was not evaluated), forest soils and storage treatments, but PGPR efficacy depended on the origin and treatment of forest soil. For example, spruce growth promotion was greatest in fresh Williams Lake and Salmon Arm soil, but PGPR efficacy in Mackenzie soil was greatest after storage at -10 degrees C. Our results support the hypothesis that storage-induced changes in soil microflora contribute to variability in PGPR efficacy, but we were unable to identify specific characteristics of these forest soils that related directly to plant growth response variability.

In the field, populations occur that consist of uninfected and infected individuals of the same Trichogramma species. Uninfected females produce sons from unfertilized eggs and daughters from fertilized eggs. Infected females produce daughters From unfertilized and fertilized eggs. Infected males do not occur. Wolbachia is inherited from mother to daughter. Horizontal transmission is extremely rare. Therefore uninfected and infected forms can be considered as two separated populations living on the same host. According to the Competitive exclusion principle this situation cannot occur without special mechanisms. In this paper we investigate whether a mechanism specific for Wolbachia infection can explain coexistence. Wolbachia has a negative effect on total offspring production, bur causes a sex ratio of 100% females. Furthermore uninfected females often sibmate, while infected Females never sibmate, because they do not have brothers. Sibmating has a negative effect on offspring production of the inbred female offspring. These mechanisms form the basis for a simple continuous model. By calculating invasion criteria we show that this model can explain coexistence of uninfected and infected Trichogramma forms.","1998",NA,"10.2307/3546779","WOS:000072934100017"

The type of interaction and index of dominance (I-D) between species were markedly influenced by temperature and a(w). Generally, F. moniliforme and F. proliferatum were very competitive and dominant against the Penicillium spp. and A. flavus. They were in turn dominated by A. niger, but mutually antagonistic when paired with F, graminearum and A. ochraceus. Under slightly drier conditions (< 0.98 a(w)) A. ochraceus became more competitive and dominant over the fumonisin-producing species. A. flavus was dominant only at 30 degrees C and < 0.96 a(w). F. moniliforme and F. proliferatum demonstrated dominance against all species over a range of temperatures and 0.994 to 0 96 a(w). At lower a(w) levels they were less competitive. The growth rate of the two fumonisin-producing species was significantly reduced by F.graminearum, regardless of a(w). F. moniliforme and F, proliferatum reduced growth of Penicillium and Aspergillus spp., especially at > 0.96 a(w). At < 0.96 a(w) growth of these species was unaffected. Using Biolog plates the effect of a(w) and temperature on utilization patterns of carbon sources in maize were evaluated for the first time. The niche overlap indices relative to F. moniliforme and F. proliferatum were determined and compared with that of each interacting species. NOIs for F. moniliforme and F. proliferatum were > 0.90 at > 0.96 a(w) and 25 and 30 degrees, indicative of co-existence with other species. Most of species had NOIs > 0 90, except in some cases when paired with F, moniliforme, where NOIs < 0.80 suggested the occupation of different niches. Although there was no significant correlation between the I-D and NOI methods both suggested that the niche overlap between species was in a state of flux and significantly influenced by both temperature and water availability. This suggests that interpretation of I-D, or NOIs carried out under one set of environmental conditions may be misleading when considering interactions between species and also where screening for biocontrol potential is being considered.","1998",NA,"10.1017/S0953756297005777","WOS:000075020900009"

First, how can so many species coexist! There is evidence of niche partitioning, notably of physical space, but vast interspecific overlaps and trait plasticity seem equally common. It appears that coexistence of species with similar resource needs is made possible by small-scale disturbance and predation, which likely reduce local population sizes and interspecific competition. Regional processes such as dispersal, large-scale disturbance, and aggregation, which govern ecosystem level diversity, may also affect local species interactions and soil-core scale diversity. Second, what is the significance of having so many species, with so few trophic functions, for ecosystem processes! Focusing on bacterivore diversity, it is clear that species contributions to decomposition, likely to differ as a function of individual biologies, are concealed by the trophic group approach. However, considerable functional redundancy probably exists, which may explain why decomposition processes are maintained in highly disturbed soils despite the extinction of many species. Thus, soil nematode diversity is important for the long-term stability of soil functioning, and merits protection and further study.","1998",NA,NA,"WOS:000080339000001"

Our aim was to consider the possible competitive mechanisms occurring at the beginning of the species coexistence using allopatric populations in single and mixed species experiments. Two series of competition experiments were performed. In the first, adult specimens were used for breeding and feeding trials. Both population dynamics and the percentage of ovigerous females and juveniles were evaluated during 10 months. Adult densities and juvenile percentage of A.aquaticus were lower in the presence of P. coxalis s.l. than when alone. At the end of the breeding experiments the dietary preferences of adults on a set of fungally conditioned leaf discs were not different among treatments. In the second series of experiments, the influence of coexistence on the feeding rates of young asellids and the relative importance of faeces and decaying plant material in their diet were investigated. Individual consumption by wild juveniles in multiple-choice laboratory experiments was measured by radioisotopes ((32)p). Juveniles of P. coxalis s.l. showed the highest ingestion rates. In co-occurrence, contrary to A.aquaticus, they were able to further increase feeding on parental faeces. The role of parental faeces in the diet of the two species juveniles and the competitive dominance of P. coxalis s.l. are discussed.","1998",NA,"10.1023/A:1003296620693","WOS:000076259700002"
"Mills, KE; Bever, JD","Maintenance of diversity within plant communities: Soil pathogens as agents of negative feedback","ECOLOGY","The effect of soil pathogens on plant communities was investigated using four old-field perennial plant species and five isolates of a pathogenic oomycete in the genus Pythium. These Pythium strains were isolated from the roots of two of the plant species, Danthonia spicata and Panicum sphaerocarpon, used in a previous experiment on the consequences of changes in the soil community on plant growth. In this previous experiment, Danthonia and Panicum changed the soil community in a manner that reduced their growth relative to that of a third plant species, Anthoxanthum odoratum. In the current experiments, we found that inoculation with Pythium reduced overall plant mass and root:shoot ratios, but Danthonia and Panicum were more susceptible to the presence of Pythium than the other two plant species, Anthoxanthum and Plantago lanceolata. In addition, Pythium accumulates at different rates on different plant species, with a greater than tenfold higher population observed in association with Panicum compared to Anthoxanthum. The results of these experiments suggest that the accumulation of species-specific soil pathogens could account for the previous observation of negative feedback on plant growth through changes in the soil community. As negative feedback may act to maintain plant species diversity within a community, these results suggest that soil pathogens may themselves contribute to the maintenance of plant species diversity.","1998",NA,"10.2307/176779","WOS:000074853000010"

The average intraspecific genetic distance estimated from riboprint data was greatest among C. steinii isolates (0.0790, n = 37), intermediate among C. cucullus isolates (0.0519, n = 37), and the least among C. inflata isolates (0.0383, n = 40). Phylogenetic analysis of riboprint data using distance methods revealed no geographic pattern in the distribution of riboprints in any of the species examined. Furthermore, many of the riboprints were globally distributed, suggesting no equatorial barrier to species dispersal in the species examined. Several riboprints, however, appeared to be restricted on the basis of temperature, suggesting the possibility of fitness differences among riboprints with respect to environmental variables. Shared riboprints between two species of Colpoda indicates the limitations of riboprints in species discrimination within in this group, possibly due to the retention of ancestral polymorphisms or the inadequate resolution of the region of LSU rRNA gene that we examined. Additional molecular markers will be needed in order to resolve this issue.","1998",NA,"10.1016/S0932-4739(98)80001-1","WOS:000077910200001"

Over 200 preparations of wild-type field isolates, laboratory strains, and plaque-derived subpopulations were examined. Marked heterogeneity was found in the ability of these viruses to induce IFN, covering a 10,000-fold range. A good fit to a normal distribution for the log of the IFN yields suggests a continuum of incremental changes in the viral genome may govern the IFN-inducing capacity of consensus populations derived from independently arising infections. A broad range in the magnitude of these changes, skewed towards inducers of high IFN yields, is consistent with a comparable series of ribonucleotide changes in the VSV genome, a sine qua non of a quasispecies population. Plaque- or vesicle-derived populations displayed standard deviations less than the mean IFN yields, though skewed to higher yielders, whereas populations from field and laboratory samples which differed widely in time and origin of isolation gave standard deviations greater than the means. The plaque isolation of IFN-inducing particles of VSV-IN, normally masked in populations by the predominance of non-IFN-inducing particles that suppress IFN induction, and the isolation of potent wild-type IFN-inducing VSV-IN from cows during an outbreak of vesicular stomatitis in a region that had yielded only virus expressing the non-IFN-inducing phenotype in prior and subsequent years, supports the view that genetic bottlenecks are operative in the natural transmission of this disease.","1998",NA,"10.1128/JVI.72.1.542-549.1998","WOS:A1998YL01000064"

In the present study we provide direct evidence that the relative fitness of two competing viral subpopulations may depend on the multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.). Two closely related subpopulations of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) of serotype C, which differed in their history of cytolytic passages in BHK-21 cells, were subjected to growth-competition experiments in BHK-21 cells, One of the populations, termed S, was found to have a selective advantage over the other population, termed L, only when the competition passages were carried out at low m.o.i. In contrast, both populations, L and S, coexisted during serial passages carried out at high m.o.i. No differences between S and L were detected in assays of inhibition of infectivity by synthetic peptides, in cell binding-competition experiments, or in virulence for BHK-21 cells, However, FMDV S displayed increased heparin binding compared with L, and L higher virulence for Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells than S, These results with FMDV suggest that small differences in the interaction of the virus with the host cell may contribute to an m.o.i.-dependent selective advantage of one viral subpopulation over a closely related subpopulation, Therefore, different viral mutants from quasispecies replicating in vivo may be selected depending on the number of variant viruses relative to the number of susceptible cells.","1998",NA,"10.1099/0022-1317-79-12-2971","WOS:000077603200012"

A specific mutation in the internal ribosome entry site of persistent FMDV was previously associated with enhanced translation initiation activity that could contribute to the hypervirulent phenotype for BHK-21 cells. Here we report that several hypervirulent FMDV variants arising upon serial cytolytic passage show an invariant internal ribosome entry site but have a number of mutations affecting structural and nonstructural viral proteins. The construction of chimeric type O-type C infectious transcripts has allowed the mapping of a major determinant of hypervirulence to the viral capsid. Tissue culture-adapted FMDV displayed enhanced affinity for heparin, but binding to cell surface heparan sulfate moieties was not required for expression of the hypervirulent phenotype in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Virulence was identical or even higher for glycosaminoglycan-deficient CHO cells than for wild-type CHO cells. FMDV variants with decreased affinity for heparin were selected from a high-binding parental population and analyzed. Substitutions associated with decreased heparin binding were located at positions 173 of capsid protein VP3 and 144 of capsid protein VP1. These substitutions had a moderate effect on virulence for BHK-21 cells but completely abrogated infection of CHO cells. The comparative results with several FMDV isolates show that (i) increased affinity for heparin and alterations in cell tropism may be mediated by a number of independent sites on the viral capsid and (ii) the same capsid modifications may have different effects on different cell types.","1998",NA,"10.1128/JVI.72.8.6362-6372.1998","WOS:000074730200012"

B. goodii is restricted to sixteen populations, most of which are remnants on roadsides due to landscape fragmentation from agricultural activities. Bioclimatic profiles indicate that B. gardneri spans a wider range of climates than B. goodii. However, their post-fire survival and resprouting vigour, rates of seedling growth and soil penetration and susceptibility to seedling predators are similar. Both have the potential for geographic range extension, especially B. goodi. Seedlings of both species survived for at least 3 years at sites with 2 (but not 3) months shorter and 1 month longer growing seasons than experienced by natural B. goodii populations. Seedling establishment did not occur in the absence of fire and was low (1.3% of released intact seeds for B. goodii) even following en masse release of seeds after fire. Sowing of intact seeds, especially in cleared areas and with protection from herbivores, increased this to 35%. Fire survival among adults of both species was 100% following two fires. B. goodii, which roots along its rhizomes, produces ramets, while B. gardneri, with a lignotuber instead, does not. Seed production, pre-dispersal granivory and canopy seed storage are low but similar for both species, although B. gardneri has a superior level of germination. The biology of B. gardneri thus provides few insights as to why B. goodii is rare. There were no differences in topo-edaphic attributes, community structure, shading or litter cover between localized sites where either species occurred alone or together. Differences in present or prehistoric fire regimes, clearing (habitat fragmentation), susceptibility to generalist fungal pathogens, or impacts of alien invasives, cannot explain the distribution of B. goodii relative to B. gardneri. The rarity of B. goodii may be a result of its recent origin, habitat specialization (dense woodland), and the impacts of habitat fragmentation within its current range, rather than inferior vegetative, reproductive and/or ecological attributes.","1997",NA,"10.1111/j.1365-2699.1997.00131.x","WOS:A1997YB78700006"

"Bowers, RG; Turner, J","Community structure and the interplay between interspecific infection and competition","JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY","Our motivation is the need to understand how two different interactions between species-shared infection and interspecific competition-combine to determine community structure. We introduce a proto-typical model of two hosts sharing a pathogen and also competing directly. We discuss forces of infection, forces of competition and invasion criteria and their relevance to long-term outcomes and community structure. To understand their interplay, we consider first purely competitive and second purely infective interactions. We then investigate our full model to establish how the two forces combine and how the combination and related invasion criteria determine community structure. The forces of infection and competition do not merely add; there is a synergetic resistance to invasion. Using generalised invasion criteria and subsidiary conditions for the feasibility and stability of uninfected coexistence, we classify long-term outcomes. We distinguish two main routes to three-species coexistence. In the first, two host species, each of which would not alone support the pathogen, support it jointly if interspecific competition is relatively weak, interspecific infection strong. In the second, at least one host species would alone support the pathogen and both are invadable by the other, but subsidiary conditions yield two cases. In one, infected coexistence results when the two hosts would coexist stably purely competitively and at sufficiently high densities to support the pathogen jointly. Thus coexistence is promoted by weak interspecific competition but there is a tension between weak interspecific infection favouring invadability and strong interspecific infection promoting pathogen survival. In the other, infected coexistence results when the two hosts would not coexist in the absence of the pathogen. This pathogen-mediated host coexistence is expected where there is strong intraspecific infection (lowering densities) and weak interspecific infection (favouring invadability) as necessary. Results are compared with previous work and apparent competition and resource- and transmission-mediated coexistence are discussed.

Variations in preparation conditions did not significantly influence the numbers of Bacillus CFU present (P < 0.05).

The occurrence of any refuge effect in relation to the seasonal impact of both macrophyte development and recruitment of zooplanktivorous fish was monitored over the summer months (May to September) in three lakes (Cromes Broad, Hoveton Little Broad/Pound End, and Upton Broad) of variable trophic status, fish community structure and nature and extent of macrophyte cover, in the Norfolk Broads in Eastern England. At all sites, Daphnia spp. exhibited a early summer peak of abundance but had declined rapidly by July probably as a result of predation from underyearling fish. In extensive macrophyte stands (Cromes Broad) Daphnia spp. persisted after its elimination in open water, indicating some refuge effect. At sites with macrophyte cover and/or low fish predation pressure, Daphnia spp. was replaced by Ceriodaphnia spp., both with and without Simocephalus sp., thus maintaining large populations of grazing Cladocera, apparently capable of exerting a high grazing pressure on phytoplankton.

Diets of the 3 species were quantitatively analysed, and the relative abundance of algae found in stomach contents was compared with the abundance of algae in the different habitats. These results were compared with observational studies on distribution and feeding use of the habitats. The results suggest that there was marked resource partitioning between the 3 species of Diplodus in the rocky infralittoral. D, sargus mainly exploited the surge zone, while D. puntazzo and D, vulgaris preferentially exploited deeper waters. Diet analysis suggested a strong feeding niche overlap between D, sargus and D, vulgaris, although they fed in different habitats, except small individuals (total length <13 cm) of both species, which shared the same resources. D, vulgaris and D, puntazzo showed strong habitat overlap, although they exploited different food resources. D. sargus and D. puntazzo showed low spatial and feeding-niche overlap.

The quantitative composition of food differed considerably between the 3 species (mostly algae in the herbivorous S. cristata, Amphipoda in the carnivorous L. trigloides and a variety of items in omnivorous P. pilicornis). The 3 species in the course of a year overlap little in food resource use, with overlap reaching its maximum in April when juvenile Mytilus on the rock substrate are in ample supply. In S. cristata and L. trigloides, diversity of food items is similarly lowest in July and April, respectively, when these 2 species attain their optimal nutritional status. In contrast, diet diversity and food intake are inversely correlated in P. pilicornis. Evidently, resource sharing between blenniid species in the rocky shore habitat is clearly structured, but subject to seasonal dynamics.

Three different habitats were sampled: an area 600 m offshore at a depth of 15 m, a littoral zone near a reed bed (depth, 0-5 m), and an area near a sandy beach (depth, 5 m). The fish were most active in the early morning and at night, except for X. caudafasciata which was the most diurnal. X. ochrogenys was confined to the vicinity of the reeds, where few individuals of the other species were found, and prey comprised mainly ostracods, copepods and chironomid larvae (Tanytarsini).

The community organizations were compared between two taxa. The Cryptostigmata community was characterized by more species with relatively similar abundances, while the Collembola community was dominated by a few species. For the two taxa, the successional changes in the community structures were expressed by the diversity index, succession index and similarity index. Cryptostigmata showed changes in the community throughout the period. The colonization patterns of species were shown by the combination of niche breadths of species and niche overlap of populations within the community. Niche analysis suggested that the average niche sizes in terms of colonization time were similar between Collembola and Cryptostigmata, but the species packing was higher in the main species of Cryptostigmata which occupied similar niche positions on the gradient of colonization time. The succession of both communities was related to the changes in resource quality (i.e. C/N ratio and fungal abundances) during decomposition. The main species of Collembola showed different responses to the C/N ratios between colonization groups, while the main species of Cryptostigmata showed similar responses to the C/N ratios. The feeding attributes of Collembolan and Cryptostigmata species were compared in relation to the changes of resource quality. The wide utilization of resource gradient and variable feeding habits of Cryptostigmata might contribute to the coexistence of more species in their community than is the case with Collembola.","1997",NA,NA,"WOS:A1997XM97300001"

Fitness distributions in naturally occurring viral populations have been difficult to study due to the lack of markers for individual virus clones and complicating inter- and intrahost factors like the presence of multiple cell types with distinct tropisms, differences in route of transmission, and intervening immunity. Here, we quantitated the relative fitness in vivo of three subpopulations of HIV-1 marked by mutations at codons 41 and 215 of reverse transcriptase (RT) directly related to zidovudine resistance in an untreated individual who was infected by a zidovudine-resistant strain transmitted from a donor on therapy. The transmission event did not have a substantial impact on the distribution of mutants within the dominant virus population replicating to high levels in the recipient. The evolution of the RT gene was monitored for 20 months. All 102 clones obtained from the donor and the recipient at the different time points contained the M41L mutation, which is associated with a fourfold reduction in zidovudine sensitivity. The leucine at position 41 was stable, although it was encoded by TTG and CTG triplets that fluctuated in abundance partially due to founder effects of clones with nonsilent mutations at codon 215. Of the three subpopulations in the patient, distinguished by a tyrosine (TAG), aspartic acid (GAG), or serine (TCC) at the 215 position of RT, the relative fitness of the GAC variant was calculated to be 10 to 25% higher than the initial TAC variant, and the relative fitness of the TCC variant was 1% higher than that of the GAC variant. Similar to other RNA viruses, lentivirus populations like HIV-1 in patients with a high virus load apparently consist of a broader spectrum of fitness variants than the 1 to 2% fitness difference sufficient for significant replicative advantage.","1997",NA,"10.1128/JVI.71.6.4479-4484.1997","WOS:A1997WZ57100036"

This is not unexpected when one considers that many protists feed heterotrophically,,by means of either phagotrophy (bacterivory) or osmotrophy. Protistan numbers are usually low (<10(2) per g dw of aquifer material) in pristine, uncontaminated aquifers but may increase by several orders of magnitude in aquifers subject to organic pollution. small flagellates (typically 2-3(5) mu n in size in situ) are by far the dominant protists in aquifers, although amoebae and occasionally ciliates may also be present in much lower numbers. Although a wealth of new taxonomic information is waiting to be brought to light, interest in the identity of aquifer protists is not exclusively academic. If verified, the following hypotheses may prove to be important towards our understanding of the functioning of microbial communities in aquifers: (1) Differences in swimming behavior between species of flagellates lead to feeding heterogeneity and niche differentiation, implying that bacterivorous flagellates graze on different subsets of the bacterial community, and therefore play different roles in controlling bacterial densities. (2) Bacterivorous flagellates grazing on bacteria capable of degrading organic compounds have an indirect effect on the overall rates of biodegradation.","1997",NA,"10.1016/S0168-6445(97)00046-6","WOS:A1997XV02000008"

Usually, hybrid plasmids (shuttle vectors) are employed as carriers to introduce the foreign DNA into the yeast host. Unfortunately, the transformed host often suffers from some kind of instability, tending to lose or alter the foreign plasmid. Construction of stable plasmids, and maintenance of stable expression during extended culture, are some of the major challenges facing commercial production of recombinant proteins. This review examines the factors that affect plasmid stability at the gene, cell, and engineering levels. Strategies for overcoming plasmid loss, and the models for predicting plasmid instability, are discussed. The focus is on S. cerevisiae, but where relevant, examples From the better studied Escherichia coli system are discussed. Compared to free suspension culture, immobilization of cells is particularly effective in improving plasmid retention; hence, immobilized systems are examined in some detail. Immobilized cell systems combine high cell concentrations with enhanced productivity of the recombinant product, thereby offering a potentially attractive production method, particularly when nonselective media are used. Understanding of the stabilizing mechanisms is a prerequisite to any substantial commercial exploitation and improvement of immobilized cell systems.","1996",NA,"10.1016/S0734-9750(96)00033-X","WOS:A1996VV85000001"

"Yan, GY","Parasite-mediated competition: A model of directly transmitted macroparasites","AMERICAN NATURALIST","There is growing interest in host-parasite ecology, particularly with regard to the effect of parasites on host community structure, but few studies have explored the theory of parasite mediation of host competition. I developed a model to examine the impact of directly transmitted macroparasites on the competition and population dynamics of two sympatric host species. Several important features of macroparasite-mediated competition are considered in the model: the two host species compete in a classical Lotka-Volterra manner, the parasite influences the survivorship and reproduction of both hosts, and parasites exhibit aggregated distribution among host populations. The conditions for host coexistence were derived explicitly. The results suggest that host intrinsic growth rate, host carrying capacity, susceptibility, parasite pathogenicity, and the magnitude of parasite aggregation are important components influencing host coexistence. Parasites may enhance or disrupt host coexistence, depending on the relationships of these parameter values. If the individuals of the inferior species are less susceptible to infection than the individuals of superior species and/or exhibit less pathology, the inferior competitor will bear a competitive advantage, resulting in either stable coexistence or competitive exclusion. In contrast, parasites may cause more rapid extinction of the inferior species if the inferior species is more susceptible to and/or less tolerant of parasite infection. When two host species are equally susceptible to infection and parasites are equally pathogenic, parasites may still have significant consequences on the competitive outcome. Sensitivity analysis suggests that an increased degree of parasite aggregation among hosts reduces the ability of parasites to regulate host populations and decreases parasite equilibrium density. Finally, micro- and macroparasite models are compared.","1996",NA,"10.1086/285973","WOS:A1996VV53400008"

Are Opuntia hosts a selective factor for the inversion polymorphism?","HEREDITY","Previous work has shown fitness differences among chromosomal arrangements by means of selection component analysis in two Drosophila buzzatii natural populations, one of which is native to Argentina and the other a colonized population from Carboneras, Spain. Founder effects or niche shifts were proposed to explain the differences observed in the pattern of pleiotropic effects of inversions on fitness components. In this paper, we address the possible role of niche shifts by determining whether differential attraction to, oviposition on, or utilization of the rotting cladodes of two different Opuntia species (O. quimilo and O. ficus-indica) occurred among individuals carrying different second chromosome karyotypes in a natural Argentinian population. Through the analysis of more than 2500 individuals comprising five different life cycle stages associated with the necroses of these two cactus species, we found that the distributions of inversion frequencies in samples of adult flies, third instar larvae and emerging adults collected on both Opuntia species were not significantly different. Likewise, no evidence of differential oviposition was observed. These findings suggest that niche shifts cannot, solely, account for the changes observed in the Carboneras population. In addition, the selection component analysis did not reveal any significant relationship between chromosomal arrangements and the fitness components tested. These results suggest either that fitness differences might be too small to be detected or that the assumptions of the model concerning the mode of selection may not be tenable in the studied population.","1996",NA,"10.1038/hdy.1996.177","WOS:A1996VR63800007"

The logistic parameters r and K of each genotype, estimated in batch culture, were used as a measure of fitness. Strains were treated with UV to cause additional deleterious mutations. By comparing mean log fitness of parents and offspring in relation to the fitness difference of the parents, we tested whether and how deleterious mutations interact. No significant recombinational load was found in the offspring of the untreated strains. However, a significant negative effect of sex on log r and log K was found after crossing UV treated strains. We argue that this negative effect of sex on fitness suggests synergistic interaction, at least between the UV-induced and the naturally accumulated deleterious mutations.

Its negatively stranded RNA genome is capable of undergoing rapid evolution, which allows phylogenetic analysis and molecular epidemiology studies to be performed, Previous epidemiological studies in Costa Rica showed the existence of at least two distinct ecological zones of high VSV-NJ activity, one located in the highlands (premontane tropical moist forest) and the other in the lowlands (tropical dry forest). We wanted to test the hypothesis that the viruses circulating in these ecological zones were genetically distinct, For this purpose, we sequenced the hypervariable region of the phosphoprotein gene for 50 VSV-NJ isolates from these areas, Phylogenetic analysis showed that viruses from each ecological zone had distinct genotypes. These genotypes were maintained in each area for periods of up to 8 years. This evolutionary pattern of VSV-NJ suggests an adaptation to ecological factors that could exert selective pressure on the virus. As precious data indicated an absence of virus adaptation to factors related to the bovine host (including immunological pressure), it appears that VSV genetic divergence represents positive selection to adapt to specific vectors and/or reservoirs at each ecological zone.","1996",NA,"10.1073/pnas.93.23.13030","WOS:A1996VT05400066"

Unfortunately, treatment of patients with RT inhibitors results in the appearance of drug-resistant variants with specific mutations in the RT protein. We hypothesized that if 'difficult' resistance mutations (e.g. transversions/double-hits) are consistently observed at certain positions, it is likely that 'easier' nucleotide substitutions (transitions/single-hits) at that codon do not result in a drug-resistant and/or active RT enzyme. In this study,we examined codon changes involved in RT drug resistance against nucleoside and non-nucleoside inhibitors and listed all easier substitutions, which apparently were not selected, either due to reduced enzyme RT activity or lack of drug resistance. These predictions on the requirements for resistance were confirmed by published mutational data on RT variants. We also propose that differences in mutation type can explain the order of appearance of substitutions in case multiple amino acid changes are required for optimal fitness. Differences in mutation pattern have been reported for drug-resistant HIV-1 variants selected in tissue culture compared with variants found in treated patients. In contrast to the in vivo situation, a relatively small population size is handled in in vitro tissue culture systems and this may limit the chances of creating a resistance mutation. Indeed, inspection of the codon changes indicates that the in vitro culture system is more strongly biased towards the relatively easy nucleotide substitutions. These results suggest that the nucleotide substitution pattern can provide important information on RT drug resistance.","1996",NA,"10.1016/0166-3542(96)00944-8","WOS:A1996UT71200004"

Microorganisms selected for these mixtures were isolated from exposed apple tissue at weekly intervals over 5 weeks before harvest. The isolated microorganisms were classified and grouped into various nutritional clusters on the basis of their utilization of 95 carbon sources in Biolog plates using MicroLog and MLCLUST programs, respectively. Yeasts dominated isolations on nutrient yeast-dextrose agar at all isolation times. Bacteria were isolated only occasionally. Isolates were screened for their ability to control blue mold caused by Penicillium expansum on Golden Delicious apple fruit. The most promising antagonists from different clusters were paired in subsequent tests to control blue mold, with preference given to antagonists colonizing the same fruit, secondly to those colonizing different fruit, but isolated at the same time, and finally to those colonizing different fruit at different times of isolation. Among 21 yeast antagonists tested in 13 combinations, four combinations were superior to individual antagonists. In a more extensive test, control of blue mold by a combination of antagonist isolates T5-D3 and T5-E2 was consistently superior to the individual isolates. Nutritional profiles of these antagonists, based on utilization of 35 carbon and 33 nitrogen sources, revealed significant differences in carbon catabolism. These differences caused niche differentiation and allowed populations of both antagonists to flourish in the same wound. De Wit replacement series revealed a high level of coexistence between the two antagonists. This was further confirmed by the relative yield that was close to unity at all antagonist proportions tested. Combining antagonists on the basis of niche differentiation was an effective method of improving control of postharvest blue mold, and probably also for other pre- and postharvest diseases.","1996",NA,"10.1094/Phyto-86-473","WOS:A1996UJ48300007"

"Read, DJ","The structure and function of the ericoid mycorrhizal root","ANNALS OF BOTANY","The uniformity of structure of the anatomically simple ericoid mycorrhizal hair root across many plant families, including Epacridaceae, that are diagnostic of heathland, and the characteristic restriction of its occurrence to nutrient impoverished soils, are both emphasized. The extent to which the predominantly ascomycetous fungal endophytes of these roots are taxonomically related is discussed. In functional terms, the role of the mycorrhiza in nutrient mobilization is evaluated on the basis of experiments with ericaceous plants. The considerable saprotrophic potential of endophytes such as Hymenoscyphus ericae is demonstrated and the significance of this for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) nutrition of plants growing in sclerophyllous litter of high C:N and C:P ratios is discussed. The need to carry out experiments using epacrid hosts is stressed. It is considered that the selective provision, by ericoid mycorrhizal Fungi, of access to recalcitrant organic sources of N and P facilitates niche differentiation and so contributes to the maintenance of species diversity which is a feature of heaths with a significant component of epacrid or ericaceous plants particularly in the southern hemisphere.

"Anderson, OR","The physiological ecology of planktonic sarcodines with applications to paleoecology: Patterns in space and time","JOURNAL OF EUKARYOTIC MICROBIOLOGY","Planktonic sarcodines, suspended in the water column, are conveniently grouped into three categories based on functional morphology: (1) gymnamoebae and their relatives, which lack major living or nonliving compartmentalizing barriers, (2) foraminifera, and testate amoebae enclosed by a test or shell with one or more major openings, but lacking extensive cytoplasmic compartmentalizing barriers, and (3) radiolaria, which exhibit distinct compartmentalization of the cytoplasm into functional zones. Differences in feeding strategies and trophic activity of members in the three groups reflect in part these differences in functional morphology. Members of all three groups form symbiotic associations with Monera and protists, including algae, thus partially offsetting interspecific trophic competition among species occupying the same water mass. Physiological and morphological adaptations supporting a symbiotic association are presented. C-14-labeling studies of endosymbiotic radiolarian species show a substantial contribution of carbon to the host. Rates of calcification (planktonic foraminfera) and silica deposition (radiolaria) are reported, based on morphometric analyses and isotopic labeling studies. Major distributional patterns in space and time for each of the three groups, and some ecological principles explaining these regularities, are presented as related to population growth dynamics, niche differentiation, water-mass properties, and the role of symbionts in supporting highly diverse communities of species within the same locale in the water column.","1996",NA,"10.1111/j.1550-7408.1996.tb03989.x","WOS:A1996VA33300002"

Air-stored fruit were capable of ripening normally with good dessert quality after one, two, and three months of storage. These fruit softened to between 9.7 N and 15.0 N and reached the ethylene climacteric peak on day 7 or 8 of ripening at 20 degrees C.

Compared to terrestrial vegetation, planktonic communities experience distorted time and space scales, Generation times are in the order of days, not years to decades, Advective fluid transport raises the critical patch size to the order of kilometers, Within these scales, species survival and growth, community assembly and successional development in the phytoplankton conform to all the standards (compositional, strategic, thermodynamic) of conventional community organisation. These processes are known to move toward competitively excluded outcomes, Equally, they are liable to be interrupted by externally imposed disturbances, which reset the succession or alter its potential outcome, These findings are not only illustrative of intermediate disturbance but are instructive in the nature of diversity-disturbance relationships generally, IDH has considerable potential to explaining persistent species co-existence.","1995",NA,NA,"WOS:A1995TP36900014"

"KIELLAND, K","AMINO-ACID-ABSORPTION BY ARCTIC PLANTS - IMPLICATIONS FOR PLANT NUTRITION AND NITROGEN CYCLING","ECOLOGY","Recent studies of nitrogen (N) cycling in arctic tundra have indicated that inorganic N supplied to plants by mineralization is not sufficient to meet the annual requirement of N by many tundra species. Whereas N mineralization is slow in tundra soils and concentrations of inorganic N are low, these soils have large stocks of both structural and soluble organic N. In light of these observations, kinetics of absorption of three amino acids (glycine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid) were measured in dominant vascular plant species of the four major ecosystem types in arctic Alaska and compared with concentrations of free amino acids in soils. Absorption rates were measured on roots using C-14-labeled substrates. Concentrations of free amino acids in soil were measured on water-extracted samples by high pressure liquid chromatography. All species had higher capacity (V-max) for ammonium uptake (measured using methylamine as an ammonium analogue) than for any amino acid. However, at concentrations observed in the field, uptake rates estimated for amino acids were similar to (glycine) or less than (aspartic and glutamic acids) that for ammonium. On the basis of these comparisons, uptake rates of the three amino acids together may account for between 10 and 82% of the total N uptake in the field, depending on species and community. Deciduous shrubs had higher uptake rates than the more slowly growing evergreen shrubs, suggesting that new growth created a sink that strongly influenced capacity for amino acid uptake. In general, ectomycorrhizal species had higher amino acid uptake than did non-mycorrhizal species. In species that were sampled from more than one community, amino acid uptake rates were highest in the community where a given amino acid was most abundant in the soil. The results indicate that, in arctic tundra, plants short-circuit the mineralization step of decomposition by directly absorbing amino acids. This implies that in the organic soils of these tundra systems (1) inorganic nitrogen is an inadequate measure of plant-available soil nitrogen, (2) mineralization rates underestimate nitrogen supply rates to plants, (3) the large differences among species in capacities to absorb different forms of N provide ample basis for niche differentiation of what was previously considered a single resource, and (4) by short-circuiting N mineralization, plants accelerate N turnover and effectively exert greater control over N cycling than has been previously recognized.","1994",NA,"10.2307/1940891","WOS:A1994PW55400018"

Contrary to expectation, both species were confirmed from analyses of their stomach contents to be omnivorous. The diets of both species varied through time in a similar manner; seeds were important in summer and especially in winter, but in autumn invertebrates constituted nearly 50% and 60% of the diet of N. alexis and P. hermannsburgensis, respectively. Other plant material (root, leaf, floral part, stem) was found in appreciable amounts in the stomach contents of both species, and fungi were identified from a small number of individuals. Both species showed a high degree of overlap in the broad types of food they ingested (seed, plant material, invertebrates); however, there was considerably less overlap in the species of seeds eaten. Analysis of microhabitat use suggested that this difference was due to differential foraging between the species; the larger, bipedal N. alexis forages in the open more than the smaller, quadrupedal P. hermannsburgensis, which is found more commonly in or under hummocks of spinifex grass. Although our findings parallel patterns of morphological specialisation and differential foraging on seeds that have been described within communities of North American heteromyid rodents, we found little evidence that the foraging economics of N. alexis or P. hermannsburgensis should depend solely or primarily on the distribution patterns of seeds. In the absence of dietary information, we suggest that ecological studies of desert rodents which focus solely on granivory, and neglect other important aspects of rodent foraging, can lead to a misinterpretation of species coexistence and community structure.","1994",NA,"10.1007/BF00627733","WOS:A1994PP22700002"

"BEVER, JD","FEEDBACK BETWEEN PLANTS AND THEIR SOIL COMMUNITIES IN AN OLD FIELD COMMUNITY","ECOLOGY","The nature of the interaction between plants and their soil community was investigated by testing for differential responses of four old-field perennial plant species to inocula derived from soil communities that had been grown with (''cultured by'') one of these four plant species. The differentiation of the soil communities was evident in measurements of plant survival, phenology, growth, and root-shoot ratios. Effects on survival and growth suggest negative feedbacks between these species and the soil communities that they culture. Survival rates of Krigia dandelion were significantly reduced when grown with their ''own'' soil community. Considered as a whole, the three other species (all grasses) had significantly lower growth and root-shoot ratios when grown with soil communities started with their own inocula compared to soil communities started with the inocula of other species. However, the significance of this effect on growth rate and root-shoot ratios was due primarily to the pairwise comparison of Anthoxanthum odoratum and Danthonia spicata and of Anthoxanthum and Panicum sphaerocarpon, respectively. Pairwise comparisons of Danthonia and Panicum do not suggest differential responses to each other's soils in growth rate or root-shoot ratios nor do soil communities appear to affect the relative competitive ability of these two species. While the components of the soil community responsible for these effects have not been identified, similar although less pronounced patterns were observed in experiments using inocula consisting of washed live root segments as compared to experiments using whole soil as inoculum, suggesting that root pathogens are one important agent.","1994",NA,"10.2307/1941601","WOS:A1994PK12900011"
"TANNER, JE; HUGHES, TP; CONNELL, JH","SPECIES COEXISTENCE, KEYSTONE SPECIES, AND SUCCESSION - A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS","ECOLOGY","One of the major questions in ecology is, what controls the structure of communities? We used projection matrix models to examine community dynamics and patterns of succession. The inputs of the model are transition probabilities of species replacements that were measured repeatedly during a long-term (1962-1989) study of diverse coral assemblages on Heron Island, Great Barrier Reef. Transitions varied strikingly among species and sites, reflecting differences in recruitment, growth, longevity (persistence), and the rate of replacement of one species by another. Species that had a poor ability to persist (e.g., algae and Pocilloporid corals) were generally good colonists. The observed number of transitions expressed as a proportion of the maximum number possible provides an index of the complexity of interactions in an assemblage, analogous to the concept of connectance in food-web analysis. Transitions occurred to and from nearly every species group, indicating that there was no competitive dominant in this system. We use the models in simulations to track transitory changes in species abundance and community composition following a major disturbance (e.g., due to a cyclone or outbreak of crown-of-thorns starfish). Some species showed a rapid initial increase followed by a decline to lower equilibrium levels, while others increased smoothly to a generally higher equilibrial abundance. The length of time required to reach a climax assemblage using the same matrix recurrently (approximate to 20 yr) is far greater than the observed interval between major disturbances, supporting nonequilibrium theories of coral reef communities. Climax assemblages were highly diverse and varied in composition from site to site. The ''intermediate disturbance hypothesis'' does not fully predict successional changes in these shallow-water coral assemblages since diversity remained very high at equilibrium (i.e., long after a major disturbance), Competitively inferior species were not eliminated because routine mortality ensured that some space always remained available for colonization. We also present a novel method for quantifying the relative importance of each species interaction to community composition and the rate of succession, based on a sensitivity analysis of the transition matrix. The analysis shows that the importance of a species to the dynamics of a community may be unrelated to its abundance at equilibrium, with some rare species groups having a greater impact than more common ones. Sensitivity analysis of this type will provide a powerful means of identifying ''keystone'' species in complex assemblages where experimental manipulation of each species is impossible.","1994",NA,"10.2307/1940877","WOS:A1994PW55400004"

Determination of in vitro carbon source utilization profiles provided further evidence for the lack of niche differentiation between the Ice(+) and the Ice(-) P.syringae strains.

The epiphytic species Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pantoea agglomerans, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Methylobacterium organophilum were all capable of exhibiting higher levels of coexistence with P. syringae than was observed with a near-isogenic P. syringae strain pair. The ecological similarity of the epiphytes was estimated with niche overlap indices derived from in vitro carbon source utilization profiles. The level of coexistence of the epiphytes was inversely correlated with the ecological similarity of the strains. Hence, the level of coexistence between the epiphytes was proportional to the degree of niche differentiation, defined as the ability to utilize carbon sources not utilized by a competing strain.

The crystallization of hen egg-white lysozyme exhibits a storage effect (aging) that depends on the length of time the lysozyme solution is stored, after dissolving from freeze-dried powder, before being brought to crystallization conditions. The number of crystals obtained increases, while their size decreases, as the solution ages. Observations suggest that this effect is due to the presence of fungi that multiply in the stored protein solution. This aging effect was used to control nucleation and determine the number and size of lysozyme crystals to be formed in a given sample.","1993",NA,NA,"WOS:A1993KG86400012"

The storage effect of irradiation on apples at room temperature has been observed. The results showed that the respiratory intensity of irradiated apple at 0.3-0.5 kGy was near or lower than that of unirradiated apple after 15 days irradiation. The amount of ethylene release was obviously inhibited when fruits were irradiated with 0.3-0.7 kGy. The flesh firmness of apple irradiated with 0.3-0.9 kGy was higher than that of unirradiated apple with the increasing of storage time. The negative correlations between the flesh firmness and the activities of pectinesterase (PE). polygalacturonase (PG) were observed when the dosage was lower than 1.5 kGy. The 2.0 kGy irradiation damaged the ultrastructure of cells, induced the softening of apple. when apples were irradiated with 0.7-2.0 kGy, the contents of 4 important volatile components of apple would be decreased. However, the dosage mentioned above had no effects on the pure chemicals. The studies showed that there was no significant effect of irradiation with 0.3-2.0 kGy on the nutritional qualities of apples and this dosage range could effectively control the verticillate pathogenic fungi. The result of storage experiments showed that the rotting fruits were obviously decreased by 0.3-0.9 kGy irradiation.","1993",NA,NA,"WOS:A1993LK32300074"

Forty three fish species, representing 32 genera in 17 families is a fairly rich ichthyofauna for a river of moderate size in Middle America. The macroinvertebrate fauna is also diverse, although aquatic vegetation consisted mainly of filamentous algae. A comparison of physico-chemical characteristics of the habitats and their fish communities revealed numerous examples of habitat separation of similar species. Extreme habitats (springs, swamps and an oxbow backwater) provide refuges for a few species which tolerate high CO2 and low dissolved O2 concentrations. A detailed analysis of food habits revealed how each species in a given habitat was able to reduce niche overlap within the fish community. Fruit and leaf-eating habits are present, but not nearly as diversified as in the Amazon. Some fish species reproduce in all months; others intermittently with peak periods; and catadromous species migrate to the sea once a year. Pronounced seasonal within-river migrations, similar to those of the Amazon are not present, perhaps because of the lack of well-defined high and low water periods of long duration in the Puerto Viejo. It is hypothesized that short-term low water temperatures during flooding may cause adhesive egg laying species to postpone spawning and thus avoid destruction of eggs that might have been laid above low water level. Egg scatterers may be stimulated to spawn by the same low temperatures, thus increasing survival of eggs and young by making them less visible and providing more potential food particles suspended in the turbid flood waters.","1993",NA,NA,"WOS:A1993PE59000003"

We now demonstrate that Muller's ratchet also operates when genetic bottleneck passages are carried out at 37 rather than 32-degrees-C. Thus, these fitness losses do not depend on growth of temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants at lowered temperatures. We also demonstrate that during repeated genetic bottleneck passages, accumulation of deleterious mutations does occur in a stepwise (ratchet-like) manner as originally proposed by Muller. One selected clone which had undergone significant loss of fitness after only 20 genetic bottleneck passages was passaged again in clone-to-clone series. Additional large losses of fitness were observed in five of nine independent bottleneck series; the relative fitnesses of the other four series remained close to the starting fitness. In sharp contrast, when the same selected clone was transferred 20 more times as large populations (10(5) to 10(6) PFU transferred at each passage), significant increases in fitness were observed in all eight passage series. Finally, we selected several clones which had undergone extreme losses of fitness during 20 bottleneck passages. When these low-fitness clones were passaged many times as large virus populations, they always regained very high relative fitness. We conclude that transfer of large populations of RNA viruses regularly selects those genomes within the quasispecies population which have the highest relative fitness, whereas bottleneck transfers have a high probability of leading to loss of fitness by random isolation of genomes carrying debilitating mutations. Both phenomena arise from, and underscore, the extreme mutability and variability of RNA viruses.","1993",NA,"10.1128/JVI.67.1.222-228.1993","WOS:A1993KB97000025"

A new approach to investigating fungal competition, using natural substrates containing a range of known biomass concentrations of each of two species, is described. Relative competitive success of each species is assessed over time in terms of propagule production and substrate colonisation by each species. In an agricultural soil Mucor hiemalis usually out-competed Trichoderma harzianum. After 27 days, the success of both species in the mixtures was independent of the initial biomass concentration of either species, although the success of T. harzianum in these mixtures was substantially inhibited relative to the T harzianum monocultures. In a forest soil, T polysporum maintained a competitive advantage over M. hiemalis, and induced M. hiemalis to produce propagules rather than mycelia. Coexistence of both species always occurred in both experiments, and in the forest soil experiment the two-species mixtures all contained a higher total microbial biomass than the monocultures of either species by day 47, suggesting some niche differentiation.","1993",NA,"10.1007/BF00341313","WOS:A1993LE06100003"

To determine how physical and biotic factors interact to affect niche differentiation among these fungi, spores of each species were placed either singly or in species pairs on oak leaf discs or moth wings and incubated at 0-degrees-C, 10-degrees and 20-degrees. When incubated singly, the two LT species grew on both substrata at all three temperatures. However, the presence of T. longibrachiatum reduced sporulation of G. pannorus and M. hyalina on oak leaves and moth wings at 20-degrees. At 10-degrees T. longibrachiatum proved to be a more effective competitor on oak leaves, while M. hyalina was the best competitor on moth wings. At 0-degrees T. longibrachiatum did not grow on either substratum. Mortierella hyalina was highly competitive against G. pannorus on moth wings at 0-degrees, while G. pannorus was a better competitor than M. hyalina on oak leaves. These results suggest that these soil and litter fungi can occupy separate temporal and spatial niches that are temperature and substrate controlled. During colder seasons when competition from mesophiles such as T. longibrachiatum may be limited, G. pannorus and M. hyalina may be active in the forest floor on plant and invertebrate remains, respectively. Although these LT species are potentially able to colonize these substrata at 20-degrees, their activity may be restricted by interactions with mesophilic fungi in warmer months. However, the relatively high competitive ability of M. hyalina on moth wings even at 20-degrees implies that it could retain a niche on invertebrate remains in litter and upper soil horizons during warmer seasons. The activity of LT fungi throughout much of the year in the forest floor of temperature forests, as well as their roles in deep soil decompositional processes, may be more important than previously recognized.","1992",NA,"10.1016/S0953-7562(09)80991-X","WOS:A1992HE46800003"

Silver carp have become established and naturalized in environments outside of its native rivers in Asia where adequate seasonal temperatures (April to July in the northern hemisphere; 18 to 25-degrees-C), increases in water levels (0.5 to 2.0 m in 24 h), and current speeds (50 cm to 1 m/s) occur, Silver carp may establish in areas outside Asia, such as the Danube River (central Europe), and the Mississippi and Missouri River basins (U.S.). The feeding niche of silver carp is not a fixed phytoplanktivorous one, but changes according to stocking density, the presence of other fish, and the species composition, size structure, and densities of the plankton. Silver carp exert significant impact on net plankton, zooplankton. and detritus pools. In lakes and reservoirs, severe pressure on limnetic zooplankton has caused blooms of nannoplankton and put silver carp in direct competition with more valuable native, zooplankton-feeding fish. In aquaculture ponds, the shift in phytoplankton size to nannoplankton has not been found to harm water quality and can actually improve it, but phytoplankton biomass levels may increase after stocking the recommended biological control densities of silver carp. Current stocking recommendations for silver carp in aquaculture ponds enhance competitive interactions and niche overlap with other fish in polyculture, changing the natural food and spatial niches of the silver carp. Biological control of excessive algal biomass using silver carp can be achieved by use of unfed fish in floating cages.","1992",NA,NA,"WOS:A1992JA33400003"

Four large pools ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 m above MLLW, were selected for experiments. Two canopy removals and a control were established in each pool in a randomized block design. One treatment was initiated in July 1989 (removal in summer) and the other in January 1990 (removal in winter). Algae were collected monthly by a destructive sampling method, until July 1990. Cystoseira removal induced some modifications in the algal assemblage. Articulated corallines, delicately branched and thick blades and branched algae were positively affected by canopy removal. The effect of summer and winter removal experiments was similar. In July 1990, control plots were still dominated by Cystoseira plants, while treatment areas supported a dense assemblage of turf-forming algae. At the specific level, however, strong negative interactions only occurred between Cystoseira and a few other algae, such as Corallina elongata, Padina pavonica and Rytiphloea tinctoria. These species accounted for many of the differences between treatment and control plots. As a consequence, diversity, expressed either as the Shannon-Weaver index (H') or as species richness (S), was not significantly affected by canopy removal. Many of the algae that grew as epiphytes on Cystoseira or that lived in the understorey were able to persist in treatment areas in the turf matrix or as epiphytes on the new dominants.

Hence, oxygen- and carbon-releasing aerenchymatous plants may affect the composition of the nitrate-reducing community in waterlogged sediment. The composition of the nitrate-reducing community in the rhizosphere of the aerenchymatous plant species Typha angustifolia was compared with the community in nonrhizospheric sediment. All three functional groups (NO2- accumulators, N2O producers, and presumed NH4+ producers) were present at both sites with an ratio of 36:45:12 and 43:22:18 for nonrhizospheric and rhizospheric sediments, respectively. Most of the isolated were gram-negative, and approximately 50% of these strains demonstrated an obligatory oxidative metabolism. In the absence of nitrate, Enterobacteriaceae (belonging to the NO2- accumulating group) became dominant during enrichment of bacteria from the rhizosphere of T. angustifolia in a chemostat with glycerol (20 mM) as substrate, both under strictly anoxic and transient oxic conditions. Addition of nitrate to the chemostats led to the predominance of denitrifying pseudomonads, irrespective of the presence or absence of oxygen. However, in the presence of nitrate under anoxic conditions, enterobacteria persisted in the medium together with pseudomonads. It was concluded that oxidative bacteria such as pseudomonads are the better competitors for limiting amounts of glycerol, provided oxygen or nitrate is present.

"TURNER, JT","ZOOPLANKTON FEEDING ECOLOGY - DO COOCCURRING COPEPODS COMPETE FOR THE SAME FOOD","REVIEWS IN AQUATIC SCIENCES","Many taxa of marine zooplankton coexist in the same water and presumably compete for the same food resources, which may be in short supply. It has been presumed that trophic niche differentiation through selective feeding may thwart competitive exclusion, promoting zooplankton diversity. Essential to such considerations is information on whether co-occurring zooplankters utilize the same or different food resources. During a cruise on the continental shelf off the southeastern U.S., determinations were made of the specific types of food ingested by adult females of ten copepod species, and adult males, females, and copepodites of an eleventh species. This was done by scanning electron microscope examination of fecal pellets, the contents of which reflected natural diets prior to capture. Fecal pellet contents were compared with assemblages of phytoplankton species in surface waters from which copepods were captured. In most cases, feeding habits of several copepod taxa of different sizes were examined at each of 16 stations where phytoplankton assemblages varied considerably in terms of abundance and composition. Copepods generally fed nonselectively, in that food items were ingested in approximate proportion to their availability. Contents of fecal pellets were usually similar to the composition of surface phytoplankton assemblages, and the most abundant phytoplankters in fecal pellets were usually the most abundant in the water. These patterns held regardless of the sizes of both the copepods and the phytoplankters. When different copepods of varying sizes were examined from the same station, they ate the same broad size and taxonomic array of phytoplankton cells. Different sexes and developmental states (copepodites) of the copepod Anomalocera ornata ate the same types of food. Some copepods ingested non-phytoplankton foods such as other crustaceans and pine pollen. The omnivorous and unselective feeding reported here is similar to patters recorded previously for some of the same and other copepod species in the Gulf of Mexico, using both fecal pellet analysis and quantitative grazing experiments. The answer to the question posed in the title is Yes, but the next question raised is Is such competition important?. Before we can further address the role of copepod feeding ecology in potential population competition, additional information is needed. Even though co-occurring copepods may ingest the same broad size array and taxonomic composition of food items, we do not know if these food resources are in such low amounts to be limiting to population growth. We need more information on not only feeding preferences, but also population food requirements and copepod feeding impact on populations of prey. Also, we know little of the feeding ecology of subadult copepods such as the nauplii that usually outnumber their parents by orders of magnitude, as well as the degree of mortality imposed upon various developmental stages of copepod populations by their predators. Thus, even though co-occurring copepod species may eat the same things, we need additional information to known if this diet overlap results in significant resource competition between species population.","1991",NA,NA,"WOS:A1991GJ67300001"
"MATVEEV, V","EXPLOITATIVE AND INTERFERENCE COMPETITION AMONG PLANKTONIC CRUSTACEANS IN A SUBTROPICAL LAKE","ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE","Competition among planktonic crustaceans was studied in a subtropical Argentinian lake. The community, dominated by Daphnia laevis, also comprised Diaphanosoma birgei, Notodiaptomus carteri, and Thermocyclops minutus. High niche overlap in terms of food and space, correlations between animal fecundities and nannoplankton density, as well as experiments on nutrient additions to bottles with lake water and Cladocera, suggested that there was competition in zooplankton. Strong Daphnia performance in the lake was associated with its wide niche and long population time lags. In summer, total biomass of crustaceans was a delayed function of nannoplankton concentration, while the latter was predicted well by the preceding crustacean biomass. This suggested exploitative regulation at the community level. However, when Daphnia was abundant in December-January, nannoplankton concentration failed to predict the rates of population increase of individual species. On the other hand, during the same period Daphnia biomass per se explained about 50% of the variance of these rates. When Daphnia became scarcer in February-March, the rates of population increase of Diaphanosoma and Thermocyclops became correlated to nannoplankton concentration. Each of the other two population parameters of crustaceans - fecundity and death rate - could simultaneously depend on nannoplankton and Daphnia density, but usually the Daphnia influence predominated, as indicated by multiple regression analysis. For all species, population parameters, and months pooled. Daphnia density effect significantly exceeded the effect of nannoplankton (P < 0.005). These results suggest that besides exploitation, interference may be an important regulator of crustacean abundance in warm lakes.","1991",NA,NA,"WOS:A1991GT18500004"

The impact of these processes on the competition and coexistence of the two copepod species was examined with a small strategic model which could be solved analytically, and a detailed numerical simulation model integrating comprehensive experimental evidence with theoretical concepts about species coexistence. In the strategic model considering the major interactions between the two populations, no stable coexistence was achieved within a reasonable parameter range under steady state conditions. However, in the numerical simulation model, which included in addition to many biological details the spatial heterogeneity of the biotope, both species coexisted for a wide and sensible parameter range. Model results suggest that in the present case study, competition is mainly caused by common predators (i.e. carnivorous zooplankton), but not by utilization of common resources. Competition for common resources is weak and diffuse, because of numerous other herbivores. Predation of A. tonsa on nauplii of both species enhances intra-specific and interspecific competition at high abundances but despite being species-specific it does not support coexistence within a reasonable parameter range. Non-selective predation by carnivorous zooplankton depending on the combined abundance of the two prey species appears as the main factor promoting competition between copepod species. At the same time, it is - at least in the model - the most important mechanism of coexistence if the prey species are spatially heterogeneously distributed and the predation pressure relies on the local prey density. Revealing this mechanism of coexistence allows a better explanation for the observed spatial distribution of estuarine copepod species.","1991",NA,"10.1016/0304-3800(91)90204-E","WOS:A1991GN05700015"

Because L. australis was previously unknown in western Europe, we present the characters to distinguish it from its close relative L. clavipes.

Olfactometer experiments showed that L. australis is attracted by the odour of decaying hogweed stalks, especially when these contain larvae of D. limbata. L. australis is also strongly attracted by the odour of stinkhorns, a habitat in which it has never been found in nature. D. phalerata is the dominant fly species in stinkhorns, and is not a host of L. australis. We offer a possible functional explanation for this unexpected habitat choice, by showing that D. transversa and D. kuntzei, both species found to breed in fungi, are also suitable hosts for L. australis.

The guts of A. fibriata and D. annulatus contained algae in similar proportions to the local periphyton. T. rostocki and M. longulum contained higher proportions of diatoms. A cluster analysis analysis revealed three species groupings: A. fuscipes and S. pallipes showed the most distinct trophic niche overlap, followed by A. fimbriata and D. annulatus. T. rostocki and M. longulum were combined in one group at a lower similarity level. Differences in foraging strategies among the six larval species are discussed. Significant differences between the utilization of several food components reduced the likelihood of any inter-specific competition for high quality food resources.","1990",NA,NA,"WOS:A1990EQ24300002"
